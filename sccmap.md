NAME
       sccmap - extract strongly connected components of directed graphs

SYNOPSIS
       sccmap [-dsv] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       sccmap  decomposes  digraphs into strongly connected components and an auxiliary map of the relationship between components.  In this map, each component is collapsed into a node.  The resulting
       graphs are printed to standard out.  The number of nodes, edges and strongly connected components are printed to standard error.  sccmap is a way of partitioning large graphs into  more  manage‚Äê
       able pieces.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -d     Preserve degenerate components of only one node.

       -s     Do not print the resulting graphs. Only the statistics are important.

       -S     Just print the resulting graphs. No statistics are printed.

       -ooutput
              Prints output to the file output. If not given, sccmap uses stdout.

       -v     Generate  additional  statistics.  In particular, sccmap prints the number of nodes, edges, connected components, and strongly connected components, followed by the fraction of nodes in a
              non-trivial strongly connected components, the maximum degree of the graph, and fraction of non-tree edges in the graph.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If no files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

DIAGNOSTICS
       sccmap emits a warning if it encounters an undirected graph, and ignores it.
