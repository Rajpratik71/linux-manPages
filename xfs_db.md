NAME
       xfs_db - debug an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_db [ -c cmd ] ... [ -i|r|x|F ] [ -f ] [ -l logdev ] [ -p progname ] device
       xfs_db -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_db  is  used  to  examine an XFS filesystem. Under rare circumstances it can also be used to modify an XFS filesystem, but that task is
       normally left to xfs_repair(8) or to scripts such as xfs_admin(8) that run xfs_db.

OPTIONS
       -c cmd xfs_db commands may be run interactively (the default) or as arguments on the command line. Multiple -c arguments may be given.  The
              commands are run in the sequence given, then the program exits.

       -f     Specifies  that  the  filesystem  image  to be processed is stored in a regular file at device (see the mkfs.xfs(8) -d file option).
              This might happen if an image copy of a filesystem has been made into an ordinary file with xfs_copy(8).

       -F     Specifies that we want to continue even if the superblock magic is not correct.  For use in xfs_metadump.

       -i     Allows execution on a mounted filesystem, provided it is mounted read-only.  Useful for shell scripts which  must  only  operate  on
              filesystems in a guaranteed consistent state (either unmounted or mounted read-only). These semantics are slightly different to that
              of the -r option.

       -l logdev
              Specifies the device where the filesystems external log resides.  Only for those filesystems which use  an  external  log.  See  the
              mkfs.xfs(8) -l option, and refer to xfs(5) for a detailed description of the XFS log.

       -p progname
              Set the program name to progname for prompts and some error messages, the default value is xfs_db.

       -r     Open  device or filename read-only. This option is required if the filesystem is mounted.  It is only necessary to omit this flag if
              a command that changes data (write, blocktrash) is to be used.

       -x     Specifies expert mode.  This enables the write and blocktrash commands.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.

CONCEPTS
       xfs_db commands can be broken up into two classes. Most commands are for the navigation and display of data structures in  the  filesystem.
       Other commands are for scanning the filesystem in some way.

       Commands  which are used to navigate the filesystem structure take arguments which reflect the names of filesystem structure fields.  There
       can be multiple field names separated by dots when the underlying structures are nested, as in C.  The field names can be  indexed  (as  an
       array index) if the underlying field is an array.  The array indices can be specified as a range, two numbers separated by a dash.

       xfs_db  maintains a current address in the filesystem.  The granularity of the address is a filesystem structure.  This can be a filesystem
       block, an inode or quota (smaller than a filesystem block), or a directory block (could be larger than a filesystem block).   There  are  a
       variety of commands to set the current address.  Associated with the current address is the current data type, which is the structural type
       of this data.  Commands which follow the structure of the filesystem always set the type as well as the address.   Commands  which  examine
       pieces of an individual file (inode) need the current inode to be set, this is done with the inode command.

       The  current  address/type  information  is actually maintained in a stack that can be explicitly manipulated with the push, pop, and stack
       commands.  This allows for easy examination of a nested filesystem structure.  Also, the last several locations visited  are  stored  in  a
       ring buffer which can be manipulated with the forward, back, and ring commands.

       XFS  filesystems  are divided into a small number of allocation groups.  xfs_db maintains a notion of the current allocation group which is
       manipulated by some commands. The initial allocation group is 0.

COMMANDS
       Many commands have extensive online help. Use the help command for more details on any command.

       a      See the addr command.

       ablock filoff
              Set current address to the offset filoff (a filesystem block number) in the attribute area of the current inode.

       addr [field-expression]
              Set current address to the value of the field-expression.  This is used to "follow" a reference in one structure to the object being
              referred to. If no argument is given, the current address is printed.

       agf [agno]
              Set current address to the AGF block for allocation group agno.  If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.

       agfl [agno]
              Set current address to the AGFL block for allocation group agno.  If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.

       agi [agno]
              Set current address to the AGI block for allocation group agno.  If no argument is given, use the current allocation group.

       b      See the back command.

       back   Move to the previous location in the position ring.

       blockfree
              Free block usage information collected by the last execution of the blockget command. This must be done before another blockget com‐
              mand can be given, presumably with different arguments than the previous one.

       blockget [-npvs] [-b bno] ... [-i ino] ...
              Get block usage and check filesystem consistency.  The information is saved for use by a subsequent blockuse, ncheck, or  blocktrash
              command.

                 -b  is used to specify filesystem block numbers about which verbose information should be printed.

                 -i  is used to specify inode numbers about which verbose information should be printed.

                 -n  is used to save pathnames for inodes visited, this is used to support the xfs_ncheck(8) command. It also means that pathnames
                     will be printed for inodes that have problems. This option uses a lot of memory so is not enabled by default.

                 -p  causes error messages to be prefixed with the filesystem name being processed. This is useful if several copies of xfs_db are
                     run in parallel.

                 -s  restricts output to severe errors only. This is useful if the output is too long otherwise.

                 -v  enables verbose output. Messages will be printed for every block and inode processed.

       blocktrash [-z] [-o offset] [-n count] [-x min] [-y max] [-s seed] [-0|1|2|3] [-t type] ...
              Trash  randomly  selected filesystem metadata blocks.  Trashing occurs to randomly selected bits in the chosen blocks.  This command
              is available only in debugging versions of xfs_db.  It is useful for testing xfs_repair(8).

                 -0 | -1 | -2 | -3
                     These are used to set the operating mode for blocktrash.  Only one can be used: -0 changed bits are cleared; -1 changed  bits
                     are set; -2 changed bits are inverted; -3 changed bits are randomized.

                 -n  supplies the count of block-trashings to perform (default 1).

                 -o  supplies  the bit offset at which to start trashing the block.  If the value is preceded by a '+', the trashing will start at
                     a randomly chosen offset that is larger than the value supplied.  The default is to randomly choose an offset anywhere in the
                     block.

                 -s  supplies a seed to the random processing.

                 -t  gives  a  type  of  blocks to be selected for trashing. Multiple -t options may be given. If no -t options are given then all
                     metadata types can be trashed.

                 -x  sets the minimum size of bit range to be trashed. The default value is 1.

                 -y  sets the maximum size of bit range to be trashed. The default value is 1024.

                 -z  trashes the block at the top of the stack.  It is not necessary to run blockget if this option is supplied.

       blockuse [-n] [-c count]
              Print usage for current filesystem block(s).  For each block, the type and (if any) inode are printed.

                 -c  specifies a count of blocks to process. The default value is 1 (the current block only).

                 -n  specifies that file names should be printed. The prior blockget command must have also specified the -n option.

       bmap [-a] [-d] [block [len]]
              Show the block map for the current inode.  The map display can be restricted to an area of the file with the  block  and  len  argu‐
              ments. If block is given and len is omitted then 1 is assumed for len.

              The  -a  and  -d  options are used to select the attribute or data area of the inode, if neither option is given then both areas are
              shown.

       check  See the blockget command.

       convert type number [type number] ... type
              Convert from one address form to another.  The known types, with alternate names, are:
                 agblock or agbno (filesystem block within an allocation group)
                 agino or aginode (inode number within an allocation group)
                 agnumber or agno (allocation group number)
                 bboff or daddroff (byte offset in a daddr)
                 blkoff or fsboff or agboff (byte offset in a agblock or fsblock)
                 byte or fsbyte (byte address in filesystem)
                 daddr or bb (disk address, 512-byte blocks)
                 fsblock or fsb or fsbno (filesystem block, see the fsblock command)
                 ino or inode (inode number)
                 inoidx or offset (index of inode in filesystem block)
                 inooff or inodeoff (byte offset in inode)

              Only conversions that "make sense" are allowed.  The compound form (with more than three arguments) is useful for  conversions  such
              as convert agno ag agbno agb fsblock.

       daddr [d]
              Set current address to the daddr (512 byte block) given by d.  If no value for d is given, the current address is printed, expressed
              as a daddr.  The type is set to data (uninterpreted).

       dblock filoff
              Set current address to the offset filoff (a filesystem block number) in the data area of the current inode.

       debug [flagbits]
              Set debug option bits. These are used for debugging xfs_db.  If no value is given for flagbits, print the current debug option bits.
              These are for the use of the implementor.

       dquot [projectid_or_userid]
              Set current address to a project or user quota block.

       echo [arg] ...
              Echo the arguments to the output.

       f      See the forward command.

       forward
              Move forward to the next entry in the position ring.

       frag [-adflqRrv]
              Get file fragmentation data. This prints information about fragmentation of file data in the filesystem (as opposed to fragmentation
              of freespace, for which see the freesp command). Every file in the filesystem is examined to see how far from ideal its extent  map‐
              pings are. A summary is printed giving the totals.

                 -v  sets  verbosity, every inode has information printed for it.  The remaining options select which inodes and extents are exam‐
                     ined.  If no options are given then all are assumed set, otherwise just those given are enabled.

                 -a  enables processing of attribute data.

                 -d  enables processing of directory data.

                 -f  enables processing of regular file data.

                 -l  enables processing of symbolic link data.

                 -q  enables processing of quota file data.

                 -R  enables processing of realtime control file data.

                 -r  enables processing of realtime file data.

       freesp [-bcds] [-a ag] ... [-e i] [-h h1] ... [-m m]
              Summarize free space for the filesystem. The free blocks are examined and totalled, and displayed in the form of a histogram, with a
              count of extents in each range of free extent sizes.

                 -a  adds  ag  to  the  list  of allocation groups to be processed. If no -a options are given then all allocation groups are pro‐
                     cessed.

                 -b  specifies that the histogram buckets are binary-sized, with the starting sizes being the powers of 2.

                 -c  specifies that freesp will search the by-size (cnt) space Btree instead of the default by-block (bno) space Btree.

                 -d  specifies that every free extent will be displayed.

                 -e  specifies that the histogram buckets are equal-sized, with the size specified as i.

                 -h  specifies a starting block number for a histogram bucket as h1.  Multiple -h's are given to specify the complete set of buck‐
                     ets.

                 -m  specifies that the histogram starting block numbers are powers of m.  This is the general case of -b.

                 -s  specifies that a final summary of total free extents, free blocks, and the average free extent size is printed.

       fsb    See the fsblock command.

       fsblock [fsb]
              Set current address to the fsblock value given by fsb.  If no value for fsb is given the current address is printed, expressed as an
              fsb.  The type is set to data (uninterpreted). XFS filesystem block numbers are computed ((agno << agshift) | agblock) where agshift
              depends  on  the size of an allocation group. Use the convert command to convert to and from this form. Block numbers given for file
              blocks (for instance from the bmap command) are in this form.

       hash string
              Prints the hash value of string using the hash function of the XFS directory and attribute implementation.

       help [command]
              Print help for one or all commands.

       inode [inode#]
              Set the current inode number. If no inode# is given, print the current inode number.

       label [label]
              Set the filesystem label. The filesystem label can be used by mount(8) instead of using a device special file.  The  maximum  length
              of  an  XFS  label  is  12 characters - use of a longer label will result in truncation and a warning will be issued. If no label is
              given, the current filesystem label is printed.

       log [stop | start filename]
              Start logging output to filename, stop logging, or print the current logging status.

       metadump [-egow] filename
              Dumps metadata to a file. See xfs_metadump(8) for more information.

       ncheck [-s] [-i ino] ...
              Print name-inode pairs. A blockget -n command must be run first to gather the information.

                 -i  specifies an inode number to be printed. If no -i options are given then all inodes are printed.

                 -s  specifies that only setuid and setgid files are printed.

       p      See the print command.

       pop    Pop location from the stack.

       print [field-expression] ...
              Print field values.  If no argument is given, print all fields in the current structure.

       push [command]
              Push location to the stack. If command is supplied, set the current location to the results of command after pushing the  old  loca‐
              tion.

       q      See the quit command.

       quit   Exit xfs_db.

       ring [index]
              Show position ring (if no index argument is given), or move to a specific entry in the position ring given by index.

       sb [agno]
              Set current address to SB header in allocation group agno.  If no agno is given, use the current allocation group number.

       source source-file
              Process commands from source-file.  source commands can be nested.

       stack  View the location stack.

       type [type]
              Set  the  current  data type to type.  If no argument is given, show the current data type.  The possible data types are: agf, agfl,
              agi, attr, bmapbta, bmapbtd, bnobt, cntbt, data, dir, dir2, dqblk, inobt, inode, log, rtbitmap, rtsummary,  sb,  symlink  and  text.
              See the TYPES section below for more information on these data types.

       uuid [uuid | generate | rewrite | restore]
              Set the filesystem universally unique identifier (UUID).  The filesystem UUID can be used by mount(8) instead of using a device spe‐
              cial file.  The uuid can be set directly to the desired UUID, or it can be automatically generated using the generate option.  These
              options will both write the UUID into every copy of the superblock in the filesystem.  On a CRC-enabled filesystem, this will set an
              incompatible superblock flag, and the filesystem will not be mountable with older kernels.  This can be reverted  with  the  restore
              option,  which  will  copy  the original UUID back into place and clear the incompatible flag as needed.  rewrite copies the current
              UUID from the primary superblock to all secondary copies of the superblock.  If no argument is given, the current filesystem UUID is
              printed.

       version [feature | versionnum features2]
              Enable selected features for a filesystem (certain features can be enabled on an unmounted filesystem, after mkfs.xfs(8) has created
              the filesystem).  Support for unwritten extents can be enabled using the extflg option. Support for version  2  log  format  can  be
              enabled  using  the  log2  option.  Support  for  extended  attributes can be enabled using the attr1 or attr2 option. Once enabled,
              extended attributes cannot be disabled, but the user may toggle between attr1 and attr2 at will (older kernels may not  support  the
              newer version).

              If  no  argument is given, the current version and feature bits are printed.  With one argument, this command will write the updated
              version number into every copy of the superblock in the filesystem.  If two arguments are given, they will be used as numeric values
              for the versionnum and features2 bits respectively, and their string equivalent reported (but no modifications are made).

       write [-c] [field value] ...
              Write a value to disk.  Specific fields can be set in structures (struct mode), or a block can be set to data values (data mode), or
              a block can be set to string values (string mode, for symlink blocks).  The operation happens immediately: there is no buffering.

              Struct mode is in effect when the current type is structural, i.e. not data. For struct mode, the syntax is "write field value".

              Data mode is in effect when the current type is data. In this case the contents of the block can  be  shifted  or  rotated  left  or
              right,  or  filled with a sequence, a constant value, or a random value. In this mode write with no arguments gives more information
              on the allowed commands.

                 -c  Skip write verifiers and CRC recalculation; allows invalid data to be written to disk.

TYPES
       This section gives the fields in each structure type and their meanings.  Note that some types of block cover multiple  actual  structures,
       for instance directory blocks.

       agf       The  AGF  block is the header for block allocation information; it is in the second 512-byte block of each allocation group.  The
                 following fields are defined:
                     magicnum    AGF block magic number, 0x58414746 ('XAGF').
                     versionnum  version number, currently 1.
                     seqno       sequence number starting from 0.
                     length      size in filesystem blocks of the allocation group. All allocation groups except the last one  of  the  filesystem
                                 have the superblock's agblocks value here.
                     bnoroot     block number of the root of the Btree holding free space information sorted by block number.
                     cntroot     block number of the root of the Btree holding free space information sorted by block count.
                     bnolevel    number of levels in the by-block-number Btree.
                     cntlevel    number of levels in the by-block-count Btree.
                     flfirst     index into the AGFL block of the first active entry.
                     fllast      index into the AGFL block of the last active entry.
                     flcount     count of active entries in the AGFL block.
                     freeblks    count of blocks represented in the freespace Btrees.
                     longest     longest free space represented in the freespace Btrees.
                     btreeblks   number of blocks held in the AGF Btrees.

       agfl      The  AGFL  block  contains  block  numbers  for use of the block allocator; it is in the fourth 512-byte block of each allocation
                 group.  Each entry in the active list is a block number within the allocation group that can be used for  any  purpose  if  space
                 runs  low.  The AGF block fields flfirst, fllast, and flcount designate which entries are currently active.  Entry space is allo‐
                 cated in a circular manner within the AGFL block.  Fields defined:
                     bno         array of all block numbers. Even those which are not active are printed.

       agi       The AGI block is the header for inode allocation information; it is in the third 512-byte block of each allocation group.  Fields
                 defined:
                     magicnum    AGI block magic number, 0x58414749 ('XAGI').
                     versionnum  version number, currently 1.
                     seqno       sequence number starting from 0.
                     length      size in filesystem blocks of the allocation group.
                     count       count of inodes allocated.
                     root        block number of the root of the Btree holding inode allocation information.
                     level       number of levels in the inode allocation Btree.
                     freecount   count of allocated inodes that are not in use.
                     newino      last inode number allocated.
                     dirino      unused.
                     unlinked    an  array of inode numbers within the allocation group. The entries in the AGI block are the heads of lists which
                                 run through the inode next_unlinked field. These inodes are to be  unlinked  the  next  time  the  filesystem  is
                                 mounted.

       attr      An  attribute  fork  is  organized as a Btree with the actual data embedded in the leaf blocks. The root of the Btree is found in
                 block 0 of the fork.  The index (sort order) of the Btree is the hash value of the attribute name.  All the blocks contain a blk‐
                 info  structure  at  the beginning, see type dir for a description. Nonleaf blocks are identical in format to those for version 1
                 and version 2 directories, see type dir for a description. Leaf blocks can refer to "local" or "remote" attribute  values.  Local
                 values  are  stored  directly in the leaf block.  Remote values are stored in an independent block in the attribute fork (with no
                 structure). Leaf blocks contain the following fields:
                     hdr         header containing a blkinfo structure info (magic number 0xfbee), a count  of  active  entries,  usedbytes  total
                                 bytes  of  names  and  values,  the firstused byte in the name area, holes set if the block needs compaction, and
                                 array freemap as for dir leaf blocks.
                     entries     array of structures containing a hashval, nameidx (index into the block of the name), and flags incomplete, root,
                                 and local.
                     nvlist      array  of  structures describing the attribute names and values. Fields always present: valuelen (length of value
                                 in bytes), namelen, and name.  Fields present for local values: value (value string). Fields present  for  remote
                                 values: valueblk (fork block number of containing the value).

       bmapbt    Files with many extents in their data or attribute fork will have the extents described by the contents of a Btree for that fork,
                 instead of being stored directly in the inode.  Each bmap Btree starts with a root block contained within the inode.   The  other
                 levels  of  the  Btree are stored in filesystem blocks.  The blocks are linked to sibling left and right blocks at each level, as
                 well as by pointers from parent to child blocks.  Each block contains the following fields:
                     magic       bmap Btree block magic number, 0x424d4150 ('BMAP').
                     level       level of this block above the leaf level.

                     recs        [leaf blocks only] array of extent records.  Each record contains startoff, startblock, blockcount,  and  extent‐
                                 flag (1 if the extent is unwritten).
                     keys        [non-leaf  blocks only] array of key records. These are the first key value of each block in the level below this
                                 one. Each record contains startoff.
                     ptrs        [non-leaf blocks only] array of child block pointers.  Each pointer is a filesystem  block  number  to  the  next
                                 level in the Btree.

       bnobt     There  is  one set of filesystem blocks forming the by-block-number allocation Btree for each allocation group. The root block of
                 this Btree is designated by the bnoroot field in the corresponding AGF block.  The blocks are linked to sibling  left  and  right
                 blocks at each level, as well as by pointers from parent to child blocks.  Each block has the following fields:
                     magic       BNOBT block magic number, 0x41425442 ('ABTB').

                     ptrs        [non-leaf blocks only] array of child block pointers. Each pointer is a block number within the allocation  group
                                 to the next level in the Btree.

       cntbt     There  is  one  set of filesystem blocks forming the by-block-count allocation Btree for each allocation group. The root block of
                 this Btree is designated by the cntroot field in the corresponding AGF block. The blocks are linked to  sibling  left  and  right
                 blocks at each level, as well as by pointers from parent to child blocks. Each block has the following fields:
                     magic       CNTBT block magic number, 0x41425443 ('ABTC').
                     level       level number of this block, 0 is a leaf.
                     numrecs     number of data entries in the block.

                                 to the next level in the Btree.

       data      User  file blocks, and other blocks whose type is unknown, have this type for display purposes in xfs_db.  The block data is dis‐
                 played in hexadecimal format.

       dir       A version 1 directory is organized as a Btree with the directory data embedded in the leaf blocks. The root of the Btree is found
                 in block 0 of the file. The index (sort order) of the Btree is the hash value of the entry name. All the blocks contain a blkinfo
                 structure at the beginning with the following fields:
                     forw        next sibling block.
                     back        previous sibling block.
                     magic       magic number for this block type.
                 The non-leaf (node) blocks have the following fields:
                     hdr         header containing a blkinfo structure info (magic number 0xfebe), the count of active entries, and the  level  of
                                 this block above the leaves.
                     btree       array  of  entries  containing hashval and before fields. The before value is a block number within the directory
                                 file to the child block, the hashval is the last hash value in that block.
                 The leaf blocks have the following fields:
                     hdr         header containing a blkinfo structure info (magic number 0xfeeb), the count of active entries,  namebytes  (total
                                 name  string  bytes),  holes  flag  (block  needs  compaction), and freemap (array of base, size entries for free
                                 regions).
                     entries     array of structures containing hashval, nameidx (byte index into the block of the name string), and namelen.
                     namelist    array of structures containing inumber and name.

       dir2      A version 2 directory has four kinds of blocks.  Data blocks start at offset 0 in the file.  There are two kinds of data  blocks:
                 single-block  directories  have  the leaf information embedded at the end of the block, data blocks in multi-block directories do
                 not.  Node and leaf blocks start at offset 32GiB (with either a single leaf block or the  root  node  block).   Freespace  blocks
                 start  at  offset  64GiB.   The node and leaf blocks form a Btree, with references to the data in the data blocks.  The freespace
                 blocks form an index of longest free spaces within the data blocks.

                 A single-block directory block contains the following fields:
                     bhdr        header containing magic number 0x58443242 ('XD2B') and an array bestfree of the longest  3  free  spaces  in  the
                                 block (offset, length).
                     bu          array  of union structures. Each element is either an entry or a freespace.  For entries, there are the following
                                 fields: inumber, namelen, name, and tag.  For freespace,  there  are  the  following  fields:  freetag  (0xffff),
                                 length, and tag.  The tag value is the byte offset in the block of the start of the entry it is contained in.
                     bleaf       array of leaf entries containing hashval and address.  The address is a 64-bit word offset into the file.
                     btail       tail structure containing the total count of leaf entries and stale count of unused leaf entries.
                 A data block contains the following fields:
                     dhdr        header  containing  magic  number  0x58443244  ('XD2D') and an array bestfree of the longest 3 free spaces in the
                                 block (offset, length).
                     du          array of union structures as for bu.
                 Leaf blocks have two possible forms. If the Btree consists of a single leaf then the freespace information is in the leaf  block,
                 otherwise it is in separate blocks and the root of the Btree is a node block. A leaf block contains the following fields:
                     lhdr        header  containing  a  blkinfo  structure info (magic number 0xd2f1 for the single leaf case, 0xd2ff for the true
                                 Btree case), the total count of leaf entries, and stale count of unused leaf entries.
                     lents       leaf entries, as for bleaf.
                     lbests      [single leaf only] array of values which represent the longest freespace in each data block in the directory.
                     ltail       [single leaf only] tail structure containing bestcount count of lbests.
                 A node block is identical to that for types attr and dir.

                 A freespace block contains the following fields:
                     fhdr        header containing magic number 0x58443246 ('XD2F'), firstdb first data block number  covered  by  this  freespace
                                 block, nvalid number of valid entries, and nused number of entries representing real data blocks.
                     fbests      array of values as for lbests.

       dqblk     The  quota  information is stored in files referred to by the superblock uquotino and pquotino fields. Each filesystem block in a
                 quota file contains a constant number of quota entries. The quota entry size is currently 136 bytes, so with  a  4KiB  filesystem
                 block  size  there are 30 quota entries per block. The dquot command is used to locate these entries in the filesystem.  The file
                 entries are indexed by the user or project identifier to determine the block and offset.  Each  quota  entry  has  the  following
                 fields:
                     magic          magic number, 0x4451 ('DQ').
                     version        version number, currently 1.
                     flags          flags, values include 0x01 for user quota, 0x02 for project quota.
                     id             user or project identifier.
                     blk_hardlimit  absolute limit on blocks in use.
                     blk_softlimit  preferred limit on blocks in use.
                     ino_hardlimit  absolute limit on inodes in use.
                     ino_softlimit  preferred limit on inodes in use.
                     bcount         blocks actually in use.
                     icount         inodes actually in use.
                     itimer         time when service will be refused if soft limit is violated for inodes.
                     btimer         time when service will be refused if soft limit is violated for blocks.
                     iwarns         number of warnings issued about inode limit violations.
                     bwarns         number of warnings issued about block limit violations.
                     rtb_hardlimit  absolute limit on realtime blocks in use.
                     rtb_softlimit  preferred limit on realtime blocks in use.
                     rtbcount       realtime blocks actually in use.
                     rtbtimer       time when service will be refused if soft limit is violated for realtime blocks.
                     rtbwarns       number of warnings issued about realtime block limit violations.

       inobt     There  is one set of filesystem blocks forming the inode allocation Btree for each allocation group. The root block of this Btree
                 is designated by the root field in the corresponding AGI block.  The blocks are linked to sibling left and right blocks  at  each
                 level, as well as by pointers from parent to child blocks.  Each block has the following fields:
                     magic       INOBT block magic number, 0x49414254 ('IABT').
                     level       level number of this block, 0 is a leaf.
                     numrecs     number of data entries in the block.
                     leftsib     left (logically lower) sibling block, 0 if none.
                     rightsib    right (logically higher) sibling block, 0 if none.
                     recs        [leaf  blocks only] array of inode records. Each record contains startino allocation-group relative inode number,
                                 freecount count of free inodes in this chunk, and free bitmap, LSB corresponds to inode 0.
                     keys        [non-leaf blocks only] array of key records. These are the first value of each block in the level below this one.
                                 Each record contains startino.
                     ptrs        [non-leaf  blocks only] array of child block pointers. Each pointer is a block number within the allocation group
                                 to the next level in the Btree.

       inode     Inodes are allocated in "chunks" of 64 inodes each. Usually a chunk is multiple filesystem blocks, although there are cases  with
                 large  filesystem  blocks where a chunk is less than one block. The inode Btree (see inobt above) refers to the inode numbers per
                 allocation group. The inode numbers directly reflect the location of the inode block on disk. Use  the  inode  command  to  point
                 xfs_db  to  a  specific inode. Each inode contains four regions: core, next_unlinked, u, and a.  core contains the fixed informa‐
                 tion.  next_unlinked is separated from the core due to journaling considerations, see type agi field  unlinked.   u  is  a  union
                 structure  that is different in size and format depending on the type and representation of the file data ("data fork").  a is an
                 optional union structure to describe attribute data, that is different in size, format, and location depending  on  the  presence
                 and  representation  of  attribute  data, and the size of the u data ("attribute fork").  xfs_db automatically selects the proper
                 union members based on information in the inode.

                 The following are fields in the inode core:
                     magic       inode magic number, 0x494e ('IN').
                     mode        mode and type of file, as described in chmod(2), mknod(2), and stat(2).
                     version     inode version, 1 or 2.
                     format      format of u union data (0: xfs_dev_t, 1: local file - in-inode directory or symlink, 2:  extent  list,  3:  Btree
                                 root, 4: unique id [unused]).
                     nlinkv1     number of links to the file in a version 1 inode.
                     nlinkv2     number of links to the file in a version 2 inode.
                     projid_lo   owner's  project  id  (low word; version 2 inode only).  projid_hi owner's project id (high word; version 2 inode
                                 only).
                     uid         owner's user id.
                     gid         owner's group id.
                     atime       time last accessed (seconds and nanoseconds).
                     mtime       time last modified.
                     ctime       time created or inode last modified.
                     size        number of bytes in the file.
                     nblocks     total number of blocks in the file including indirect and attribute.

                     gen         inode generation number.
                 The following fields are in the u data fork union:
                     bmbt        bmap Btree root. This looks like a bmapbtd block with redundant information removed.
                     bmx         array of extent descriptors.
                     dev         dev_t for the block or character device.
                     sfdir       shortform (in-inode) version 1 directory. This consists of a hdr containing the parent inode number and  a  count
                                 of  active  entries  in  the  directory, followed by an array list of hdr.count entries. Each such entry contains
                                 inumber, namelen, and name string.
                     sfdir2      shortform (in-inode) version 2 directory. This consists of a hdr containing a count  of  active  entries  in  the
                                 directory,  an  i8count  of  entries with inumbers that don't fit in a 32-bit value, and the parent inode number,
                                 followed by an array list of hdr.count entries. Each such entry contains namelen, a saved offset  used  when  the
                                 directory is converted to a larger form, a name string, and the inumber.
                     symlink     symbolic link string value.
                 The following fields are in the a attribute fork union if it exists:

                     bmx         array of extent descriptors.
                     sfattr      shortform  (in-inode)  attribute  values. This consists of a hdr containing a totsize (total size in bytes) and a
                                 count of active entries, followed by an array list of hdr.count entries. Each such entry contains namelen, value‐
                                 len, root flag, name, and value.

       log       Log blocks contain the journal entries for XFS.  It's not useful to examine these with xfs_db, use xfs_logprint(8) instead.

       rtbitmap  If  the  filesystem has a realtime subvolume, then the rbmino field in the superblock refers to a file that contains the realtime
                 bitmap.  Each bit in the bitmap file controls the allocation of a single realtime extent (set == free). The bitmap  is  processed
                 in  32-bit  words, the LSB of a word is used for the first extent controlled by that bitmap word. The atime field of the realtime
                 bitmap inode contains a counter that is used to control where the next new realtime file will start.

       rtsummary If the filesystem has a realtime subvolume, then the rsumino field in the superblock refers to a file that contains the  realtime
                 summary  data.  The  summary file contains a two-dimensional array of 16-bit values.  Each value counts the number of free extent
                 runs (consecutive free realtime extents) of a given range of sizes that starts in a given bitmap  block.   The  size  ranges  are
                 binary  buckets  (low  size in the bucket is a power of 2).  There are as many size ranges as are necessary given the size of the
                 realtime subvolume.  The first dimension is the size range, the second dimension is the starting bitmap  block  number  (adjacent
                 entries are for the same size, adjacent bitmap blocks).

       sb        There is one sb (superblock) structure per allocation group.  It is the first disk block in the allocation group.  Only the first
                 one (block 0 of the filesystem) is actually used; the other blocks are redundant information for  xfs_repair(8)  to  use  if  the
                 first superblock is damaged. Fields defined:
                     magicnum    superblock magic number, 0x58465342 ('XFSB').
                     blocksize   filesystem block size in bytes.
                     dblocks     number of filesystem blocks present in the data subvolume.
                     rblocks     number of filesystem blocks present in the realtime subvolume.
                     rextents    number of realtime extents that rblocks contain.
                     uuid        unique identifier of the filesystem.
                     logstart    starting filesystem block number of the log (journal).  If this value is 0 the log is "external".
                     rootino     root inode number.
                     rbmino      realtime bitmap inode number.
                     rsumino     realtime summary data inode number.
                     rextsize    realtime extent size in filesystem blocks.
                     agblocks    size of an allocation group in filesystem blocks.
                     agcount     number of allocation groups.
                     rbmblocks   number of realtime bitmap blocks.
                     logblocks   number of log blocks (filesystem blocks).
                     versionnum  filesystem  version information.  This value is currently 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the low 4 bits.  If the low bits are 4
                                 then the other bits have additional meanings.  1 is the original value.  2 means that attributes  were  used.   3
                                 means  that  version 2 inodes (large link counts) were used.  4 is the bitmask version of the version number.  In
                                 this case, the other bits are used as flags (0x0010: attributes were used, 0x0020: version 2  inodes  were  used,
                                 0x0040: quotas were used, 0x0080: inode cluster alignment is in force, 0x0100: data stripe alignment is in force,
                                 0x0200: the shared_vn field is used, 0x1000: unwritten extent tracking is on, 0x2000: version 2  directories  are
                                 in use).
                     sectsize    sector size in bytes, currently always 512.  This is the size of the superblock and the other header blocks.
                     inodesize   inode size in bytes.
                     inopblock   number of inodes per filesystem block.
                     fname       obsolete, filesystem name.
                     fpack       obsolete, filesystem pack name.

                     inopblog    log2 of inopblock.
                     agblklog    log2 of agblocks (rounded up).

                     imax_pct    maximum percentage of filesystem space used for inode blocks.
                     icount      number of allocated inodes.
                     ifree       number of allocated inodes that are not in use.
                     fdblocks    number of free data blocks.
                     frextents   number of free realtime extents.
                     uquotino    user quota inode number.
                     pquotino    project quota inode number; this is currently unused.
                     qflags      quota status flags (0x01: user quota accounting is on, 0x02: user quota limits are enforced, 0x04: quotacheck has
                                 been run on user quotas, 0x08: project quota accounting is on, 0x10: project quota  limits  are  enforced,  0x20:
                                 quotacheck has been run on project quotas).
                     flags       random flags. 0x01: only read-only mounts are allowed.

                     dirblklog   log2 of directory block size (filesystem blocks).

       symlink   Symbolic  link  blocks  are  used  only when the symbolic link value does not fit inside the inode. The block content is just the
                 string value.  Bytes past the logical end of the symbolic link value have arbitrary values.

       text      User file blocks, and other blocks whose type is unknown, have this type for display purposes in xfs_db.  The block data is  dis‐
                 played in two columns: Hexadecimal format and printable ASCII chars.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Many  messages  can come from the check (blockget) command.  If the filesystem is completely corrupt, a core dump might be produced instead
       of the message
              device is not a valid filesystem

       If the filesystem is very large (has many files) then check might run out of memory. In this case the message
              out of memory
       is printed.

       The following is a description of the most likely problems and the associated messages.  Most of the diagnostics produced are only meaning‐
       ful with an understanding of the structure of the filesystem.

       agf_freeblks n, counted m in ag a
              The freeblocks count in the allocation group header for allocation group a doesn't match the number of blocks counted free.

       agf_longest n, counted m in ag a
              The  longest  free  extent  in the allocation group header for allocation group a doesn't match the longest free extent found in the
              allocation group.

       agi_count n, counted m in ag a
              The allocated inode count in the allocation group header for allocation group a doesn't match the number of inodes  counted  in  the
              allocation group.

       agi_freecount n, counted m in ag a
              The  free  inode  count in the allocation group header for allocation group a doesn't match the number of inodes counted free in the
              allocation group.

       block a/b expected inum 0 got i
              The block number is specified as a pair (allocation group number, block in the allocation group).  The block is used multiple  times
              (shared), between multiple inodes.  This message usually follows a message of the next type.

       block a/b expected type unknown got y
              The block is used multiple times (shared).

       block a/b type unknown not expected
