NAME
       SSHFS - filesystem client based on ssh

SYNOPSIS

       sshfs [user@]host:[dir] mountpoint [options]

   unmounting
        mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       SSHFS  (Secure SHell FileSystem) is a file system for Linux (and other operating systems with a
       FUSE implementation, such as Mac OS X or FreeBSD) capable of operating on  files  on  a  remote
       computer  using  just  a secure shell login on the remote computer. On the local computer where
       the SSHFS is mounted, the implementation makes use of the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) kernel
       module.  The  practical effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact with remote
       files being securely served over SSH just as if they were local files on his/her  computer.  On
       the remote computer the SFTP subsystem of SSH is used.

       If host is a numeric IPv6 address, it needs to be enclosed in square brackets.

              with this option.
