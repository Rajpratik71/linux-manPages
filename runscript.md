RUNSCRIPT(1)                                                  General Commands Manual                                                 RUNSCRIPT(1)

NAME
       runscript - script interpreter for minicom

SYNOPSIS
       runscript scriptname [logfile [homedir]]

DESCRIPTION
       runscript  is  a simple script interpreter that can be called from within the minicom communications program to automate tasks like logging
       in to a Unix system or your favorite BBS.

INVOCATION
       The program expects a script name and optionally a filename and the user's home directory as arguments, and it expects that it's input  and
       output  are  connected  to  the  "remote end", the system you are connecting to. All messages from runscript meant for the local screen are
       directed to the stderr output. All this is automatically taken care of if you run it from minicom.  The logfile and home directory  parame‚Äê
       ters  are  only  used  to tell the log command the name of the logfile and where to write it. If the homedir is omitted, runscript uses the
       directory found in the $HOME environment variable. If also the logfile name is omitted, the log commands are ignored.

KEYWORDS
       Runscript recognizes the following commands:

            expect   send     goto     gosub    return   !<   !
            exit     print    set      inc      dec      if   timeout
            verbose  sleep    break    call     log

OVERVIEW OF KEYWORDS
       send <string>
            <string> is sent to the modem. It is followed by a '\r'.  <string> can be:
              - regular text, e.g. 'send hello'
              - text enclosed in quotes, e.g. 'send "hello world"'

            Within <string> the following sequences are recognized:
                \n - newline
                \r - carriage return
                \a - bell
                \b - backspace
                \c - don't send the default '\r'.
                \f - formfeed
                \^ - the ^ character
                \o - send character o (o is an octal number)

            Control characters can be used in the string with the ^ prefix (^A to ^Z, ^[, ^ ^], ^^ and ^_). If you need to send the  ^  character,
            you must prefix it with the \ escape character.
            Octal characters are either four-digit or delemited by a non-digit character, e.g. the null character may be sent with \0000 and 'send
            1234' is equivalent to 'send \0061234'.
            Also $(environment_variable) can be used, for example $(TERM).  Minicom passes three special environment variables: $(LOGIN), which is
            the  username,  $(PASS),  which  is the password, as defined in the proper entry of the dialing directory, and $(TERMLIN) which is the
            number of actual terminal lines on your screen (that is, the statusline excluded).

       print <string>
            Prints <string> to the local screen. Default followed by '\r\n'.  See the description of 'send' above.

       label:
            Declares a label (with the name 'label') to use with goto or gosub.

       goto <label>
            Jump to another place in the program.

       gosub <label>
            Jumps to another place in the program. When the statement 'return' is encountered, control returns to the statement after  the  gosub.
            Gosub's can be nested.

       return
            Return from a gosub.

       ! <command>
            Runs  a  shell  for you in which 'command' is executed. On return, the variable '$?' is set to the exit status of this command, so you
            can subsequently test it using 'if'.

       !< <command>
            Runs a shell for you in which 'command' is executed. The stdout output of the command execution will be sent to the modem. On  return,
            the variable '$?' is set to the exit status of this command, so you can subsequently test it using 'if'.

       exit [value]
            Exit from "runscript" with an optional exit status. (default 1)

       set <variable> <value>
            Sets  the  value  of <variable> (which is a single letter a-z) to the value <value>. If <variable> does not exist, it will be created.
            <value> can be a integer value or another variable.

       inc <variable>
            Increments the value of <variable> by one.

       dec <variable>
            Decrements the value of <variable> by one.

       if <value> <operator> <value> <statement>
            Conditional execution of <statement>. <operator> can be <, >, != or =.  Eg, 'if a > 3 goto exitlabel'.

       timeout <value>
            Sets the global timeout. By default, 'runscript' will exit after 120 seconds. This can be changed with  this  command.  Warning:  this
            command acts differently within an 'expect' statement, but more about that later.

       verbose <on|off>
            By  default, this is 'on'. That means that anything that is being read from the modem by 'runscript', gets echoed to the screen.  This
            is so that you can see what 'runscript' is doing.

       sleep <value>
            Suspend execution for <value> seconds.

       expect
              expect {
                pattern  [statement]
                pattern  [statement]
                [timeout <value> [statement] ]
                ....
              }
            The most important command of all. Expect keeps reading from the input until it reads a pattern that  matches  one  of  the  specified
            ones.   If  expect encounters an optional statement after that pattern, it will execute it. Otherwise the default is to just break out
            of the expect. 'pattern' is a string, just as in 'send' (see above).  Normally, expect will timeout in 60 seconds and just  exit,  but
            this can be changed with the timeout command.

       break
            Break out of an 'expect' statement. This is normally only useful as argument to 'timeout' within an expect, because the default action
            of timeout is to exit immediately.

       call <scriptname>
            Transfers control to another scriptfile. When that scriptfile finishes without errors, the original script will continue.

       log <text>
            Write text to the logfile.

NOTES
       If you want to make your script to exit minicom (for example when you use minicom to dial up your ISP, and then start a PPP or SLIP session
       from a script), try the command "! killall -9 minicom" as the last script command. The -9 option should prevent minicom from hanging up the
       line and resetting the modem before exiting.
       Well, I don't think this is enough information to make you an experienced 'programmer' in 'runscript', but together with  the  examples  it
       shouldn't  be too hard to write some useful script files. Things will be easier if you have experience with BASIC.  The minicom source code
       comes together with two example scripts, scriptdemo and unixlogin. Especially the last one is a good base to build on for your own scripts.

BUGS
       Runscript should be built in to minicom.
