ALSABAT(1)                 General Commands Manual                 ALSABAT(1)

NAME
       alsabat - command-line sound tester for ALSA sound card driver

SYNOPSIS
       alsabat [flags]

DESCRIPTION
       ALSABAT(ALSA  Basic  Audio  Tester)  is  a simple command-line utility
       intended to help automate audio driver and sound server  testing  with
       little  human  interaction. ALSABAT can be used to test audio quality,
       stress test features and test audio before and after PM state changes.

       ALSABAT's design is relatively simple. ALSABAT plays an  audio  stream
       and  captures the same stream in either a digital or analog loop back.
       It then compares the captured stream using a FFT to  the  original  to
       determine if the test case passes or fails.

       ALSABAT  can  either  run  wholly  on  the target machine being tested
       (standalone mode) or can run as a client/server mode where by  alsabat
       client  runs  on  the target and runs as a server on a separate tester
       machine. The client/server mode still requires some manual interaction
       for  synchronization,  but this is actively being developed for future
       releases.

       The hardware testing configuration may require the use  of  an  analog
       cable  connecting  target  to  tester machines or a cable to create an
       analog loopback if no loopback mode is  not  available  on  the  sound
       hardware  that  is being tested.  An analog loopback cable can be used
       to connect the "line in" to "line out" jacks to create a loopback.  If
       only  headphone  and  mic jacks (or combo jack) are available then the
       following simple circuit can be used to create an analog loopback :-

       If tinyalsa is installed in system, user can choose tinyalsa as  back‐
       end  lib  of alsabat, with configure option "--enable-alsabat-backend-
       tiny".

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       -D     Select sound card to be tested by name.

       -P     Select the playback PCM device.

       -C     Select the capture PCM device.

       -f     Sample format
              Recognized sample formats are: U8 S16_LE S24_3LE S32_LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given S16_LE is used.

       -c     The number of channels. The default is one channel.  Valid val‐
              ues at the moment are 1 or 2.

       -r     Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 44100 Hertz.  Valid
              values depends on hardware support.

       -n     Duration of generated signal.  The value could be either of the
              two forms:
              1. Decimal integer, means number of frames;
              2. Floating point with suffix 's', means number of seconds.
              The default is 2 seconds.

       -k     Sigma k value for analysis.
              The analysis function reads data from WAV file, run FFT against
              the data to get magnitude of frequency vectors, and then calcu‐
              lates  the  average  value  and standard deviation of frequency
              vectors. After that, we define a threshold:
              threshold = k * standard_deviation + mean_value
              Frequencies with amplitude larger than threshold will be recog‐
              nized as a peak, and the frequency with largest peak value will
              be recognized as a detected frequency.
              ALSABAT then compares the detected  frequency  to  target  fre‐
              quency, to decide if the detecting passes or fails.
              The default value is 3.0.

       -F     Target  frequency for signal generation and analysis, in Hertz.
              The default is 997.0 Hertz.  Valid range is (DC_THRESHOLD,  40%
              * Sampling rate).

       -p     Total number of periods to play or capture.

       --log=#
              Write stderr and stdout output to this log file.

       --file=#
              Input WAV file for playback.

       --saveplay=#
              Target WAV file to save capture test content.

       --local
              Internal  loopback mode.  Playback, capture and analysis inter‐
              nal to ALSABAT only. This is intended for  developers  to  test
              new ALSABAT features as no audio is routed outside of ALSABAT.

       --standalone
              Add  support  for  standalone  mode where ALSABAT will run on a
              different machine to the one being tested.  In standalone mode,
              the  sound  data  can  be generated, playback and captured just
              like in normal mode, but will not  be  analyzed.   The  ALSABAT
              being  built  without  libfftw3 support is always in standalone
              mode.  The ALSABAT in normal mode can also bypass data analysis
              using option "--standalone".

       --roundtriplatency
              Round trip latency test.  Audio latency is the time delay as an
              audio signal passes through a system.  There are many kinds  of
              audio  latency  metrics.  One  useful  metric is the round trip
              latency, which is the sum of output latency and input latency.

       --snr-db=#
              Noise detection threshold in SNR (dB). 26dB indicates 5%  noise
              in  amplitude.   ALSABAT  will  return  error  if signal SNR is
              smaller than the threshold.

       --snr-pc=#
              Noise detection threshold in percentage of noise amplitude (%).
              ALSABAT will return error if the noise amplitude is larger than
              the threshold.

EXAMPLES
       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 -c 2 -f S32_LE -F 250
              Generate and play a sine wave of 250 Hertz with 2  channel  and
              S32_LE format, and then capture and analyze.

       alsabat -P plughw:0,0 -C plughw:0,0 --file 500Hz.wav
              Play  the  RIFF  WAV  file "500Hz.wav" which contains 500 Hertz
              waveform LPCM data, and then capture and analyze.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns 0.
       If no peak be detected, returns -1001;
       If only DC be detected, returns -1002;
       If peak frequency does not match with the  target  frequency,  returns
       -1003.
