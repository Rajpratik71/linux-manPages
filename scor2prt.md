NAME
       scor2prt - source-parts separation program for pmx, a MusiXTeX preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       scor2prt basename[.pmx]

DESCRIPTION
       scor2prt  is  part of pmx(1), a preprocessor for MusiXTeX. It can automatically create parts from a score by generating a set of .pmx files, one for each part, from a single .pmx
       file for the score. The appearance of the parts can be controlled by special commands in the main file. Read the PMX Manual for more information about that.
