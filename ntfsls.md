SYNOPSIS
       ntfsls [options] device

       ntfsls  [  -a  |  --all  ] [ -F | --classify ] [ -f | --force ] [ -h |
       --help ] [ -i | --inode ] [ -l | --long ] [ -p | --path PATH ] [ -q  |

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsls is used to list information about the files  specified  by  the
       PATH  option  (the  root directory by default).  DEVICE is the special
       file corresponding to the device (e.g  /dev/hdXX)  or  an  NTFS  image
       file.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsls accepts.  Nearly all
       options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  preceded  by  -
       and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that
       don't take an argument, can be combined into a  single  command,  e.g.
       -fv  is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to
       any unique prefix of their name.

       -a, --all
              Display all files.  If this option is not specified file  names
              in the POSIX namespace will not be displayed.

       -F, --classify
              Append indicator (one of */=@|) to entries.

       -f, --force
              Force  execution.  For example necessary to run on an NTFS par‐
              tition stored in a normal file.

       -h, --help
              Print the usage information of ntfsls and exit.

       -i, --inode
              Print inode number of each file.  This  is  the  MFT  reference
              number in NTFS terminology.

       -l, --long
              Use a long listing format.

       -p, --path PATH
              The directory whose contents to list or the file (including the
              path) about which to display information.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -R, --recursive
              Show the contents of  all  directories  beneath  the  specified
              directory.

       -s, --system
              Unless  this  options  is specified, all files beginning with a
              dollar sign character will not be listed  as  these  files  are
              usually system files.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of ntfsls and exit.

       -x, --dos
              Display  short  file  names,  i.e.  files in the DOS namespace,
              instead of long file names, i.e. files in the WIN32 namespace.
