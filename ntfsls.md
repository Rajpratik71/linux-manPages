NAME
       ntfsls - list directory contents on an NTFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsls [options] device

       ntfsls  [  -a | --all ] [ -F | --classify ] [ -f | --force ] [ -h | --help ] [ -i | --inode ] [
       -l | --long ] [ -p | --path PATH ] [ -q | --quiet ] [ -s | --system ] [ -V | --version ] [ -v |
       --verbose ] [ -x | --dos ] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsls  is  used to list information about the files specified by the PATH option (the root di‐
       rectory by default).  DEVICE is the special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX) or
       an NTFS image file.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsls accepts.  Nearly all options have two equiva‐
       lent names.  The short name is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.   Any  single
       letter  options,  that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.  -fv
       is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique  prefix  of  their
       name.

       -a, --all
              Display  all  files.   If this option is not specified file names in the POSIX namespace
              will not be displayed.

       -F, --classify
              Append indicator (one of */=@|) to entries.

       -f, --force
              Force execution.  For example necessary to run on an NTFS partition stored in  a  normal
              file.

       -h, --help
              Print the usage information of ntfsls and exit.

       -i, --inode
              Print inode number of each file.  This is the MFT reference number in NTFS terminology.

       -l, --long
              Use a long listing format.

       -p, --path PATH
              The  directory  whose  contents  to list or the file (including the path) about which to
              display information.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -R, --recursive
              Show the contents of all directories beneath the specified directory.

       -s, --system
              Unless this options is specified, all files beginning with a dollar sign character  will
              not be listed as these files are usually system files.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of ntfsls and exit.

       -x, --dos
              Display  short  file names, i.e. files in the DOS namespace, instead of long file names,
              i.e. files in the WIN32 namespace.
