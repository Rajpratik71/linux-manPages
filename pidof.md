PIDOF(8)             Linux System Administrator's Manual             PIDOF(8)

NAME
       pidof -- find the process ID of a running program.

SYNOPSIS
       pidof [-s] [-c] [-n] [-x] [-o omitpid[,omitpid..]]  [-o omitpid[,omit‐
       pid..]..]  program [program..]

DESCRIPTION
       Pidof finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs.  It  prints
       those  id's  on  the  standard output. This program is on some systems
       used in run-level change scripts, especially when  the  system  has  a
       System-V  like rc structure. In that case these scripts are located in
       /etc/rc?.d, where ? is the runlevel. If the system has  a  start-stop-
       daemon (8) program that should be used instead.

OPTIONS
       -s     Single  shot  -  this  instructs the program to only return one
              pid.

       -c     Only return process ids that are running  with  the  same  root
              directory.   This option is ignored for non-root users, as they
              will be unable to check the current root directory of processes
              they do not own.

       -n     Avoid  stat(2)  system  function call on all binaries which are
              located on network based file systems  like  NFS.   Instead  of
              using  this  option the the variable PIDOF_NETFS may be set and
              exported.

       -x     Scripts too - this causes the program to  also  return  process
              id's of shells running the named scripts.

       -o omitpid
              Tells pidof to omit processes with that process id. The special
              pid %PPID can be used to name the parent process of  the  pidof
              program, in other words the calling shell or shell script.

EXIT STATUS
       0      At least one program was found with the requested name.

       1      No program was found with the requested name.

NOTES
       pidof  is  actually  the same program as killall5; the program behaves
       according to the name under which it is called.

       When pidof is invoked with a full pathname to the  program  it  should
       find  the pid of, it is reasonably safe. Otherwise it is possible that
       it returns pids of running programs that happen to have the same  name
       as the program you're after but are actually other programs. Note that
       that the executable name of running processes is calculated with read‐
       link(2), so symbolic links to executables will also match.
