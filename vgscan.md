NAME
       vgscan â€” scan all disks for volume groups and rebuild caches

SYNOPSIS
       vgscan  [--commandprofile  ProfileName]  [-d|--debug]  [-h|-?|--help]  [--ignorelockingfailure]  [--mknodes]  [--notifydbus] [-P|--partial]
       [--reportformat {basic|json}] [-v|--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
       vgscan scans all SCSI, (E)IDE disks, multiple devices and a bunch of other disk devices in the system looking for LVM physical volumes  and
       volume groups.  Define a filter in lvm.conf(5) to restrict the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.

       In LVM2, vgscans take place automatically; but you might still need to run one explicitly after changing hardware.

OPTIONS
       See lvm(8) for common options.

       --mknodes
              Also checks the LVM special files in /dev that are needed for active logical volumes and creates any missing ones and removes unused
              ones.

       --notifydbus
              Send a notification to D-Bus. The command will exit with an error if LVM is not built with support for D-Bus notification, or if the
              notify_dbus config setting is disabled.

       --cache
              Scan devices for LVM physical volumes and volume groups and instruct the lvmetad daemon to update its cached state accordingly.
