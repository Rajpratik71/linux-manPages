NAME
       vgscan â€” scan all disks for volume groups and rebuild caches

SYNOPSIS
       vgscan [--commandprofile ProfileName] [-d|--debug] [-h|-?|--help] [--ignorelockingfailure] [--mknodes] [-P|--partial] [-v|--verbose]

DESCRIPTION
       vgscan  scans  all  SCSI,  (E)IDE  disks,  multiple devices and a bunch of other disk devices in the system looking for LVM physical volumes and volume groups.  Define a filter in lvm.conf(5) to
       restrict the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.

       In LVM2, vgscans take place automatically; but you might still need to run one explicitly after changing hardware.

OPTIONS
       See lvm(8) for common options.

       --mknodes
              Also checks the LVM special files in /dev that are needed for active logical volumes and creates any missing ones and removes unused ones.

       --cache
              Scan devices for LVM physical volumes and volume groups and instruct the lvmetad daemon to update its cached state accordingly.
