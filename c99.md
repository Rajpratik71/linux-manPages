DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _c_9_9 utility is an interface to the standard C compilation system;
       it shall accept source code conforming to the ISO C standard. The
       system conceptually consists of a compiler and link editor. The input
       files referenced by _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operands and −−ll option-arguments shall be
       compiled and linked to produce an executable file. (It is unspecified
       whether the linking occurs entirely within the operation of _c_9_9; some
       implementations may produce objects that are not fully resolved until
       the file is executed.)

       If the −−cc option is specified, for all pathname operands of the form
       _f_i_l_e..cc, the files:


           $$((bbaasseennaammee _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e .c).o

       shall be created as the result of successful compilation. If the −−cc
       option is not specified, it is unspecified whether such ..oo files are
       created or deleted for the _f_i_l_e..cc operands.

       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as −−cc or −−EE),
       and all input files compile and link without error, the resulting
       executable file shall be written according to the −−oo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e option (if
       present) or to the file aa..oouutt.

       The executable file shall be created as specified in _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _1_._1_._1_._4,
       _F_i_l_e _R_e_a_d, _W_r_i_t_e, _a_n_d _C_r_e_a_t_i_o_n, except that the file permission bits
       shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU

       and the bits specified by the _u_m_a_s_k of the process shall be cleared.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The _c_9_9 utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _1_2_._2, _U_t_i_l_i_t_y _S_y_n_t_a_x _G_u_i_d_e_l_i_n_e_s, except that:

        *  Options can be interspersed with operands.

        *  The order of specifying the −−LL and −−ll options, and the order of
           specifying −−ll options with respect to _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operands is
           significant.

        *  Conforming applications shall specify each option separately; that
           is, grouping option letters (for example, −−ccOO) need not be
           recognized by all implementations.

       The following options shall be supported:

       −−cc        Suppress the link-edit phase of the compilation, and do not
                 remove any object files that are produced.

       −−DD  _n_a_m_e[[==_v_a_l_u_e]]
                 Define _n_a_m_e as if by a C-language ##ddeeffiinnee directive. If no
                 =_v_a_l_u_e is given, a value of 1 shall be used. The −−DD option
                 has lower precedence than the −−UU option. That is, if _n_a_m_e is
                 used in both a −−UU and a −−DD option, _n_a_m_e shall be undefined
                 regardless of the order of the options. Additional
                 implementation-defined _n_a_m_es may be provided by the compiler.
                 Implementations shall support at least 2048 bytes of −−DD
                 definitions and 256 _n_a_m_e_s.

       −−EE        Copy C-language source files to standard output, expanding
                 all preprocessor directives; no compilation shall be
                 performed. If any operand is not a text file, the effects are
                 unspecified.

       −−gg        Produce symbolic information in the object or executable
                 files; the nature of this information is unspecified, and may
                 be modified by implementation-defined interactions with other
                 options.

       −−II  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Change the algorithm for searching for headers whose names
                 are not absolute pathnames to look in the directory named by
                 the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y pathname before looking in the usual places.
                 Thus, headers whose names are enclosed in double-quotes ("""")
                 shall be searched for first in the directory of the file with
                 the ##iinncclluuddee line, then in directories named in −−II options,
                 and last in the usual places. For headers whose names are
                 enclosed in angle brackets (""<<>>""), the header shall be
                 searched for only in directories named in −−II options and then
                 in the usual places. Directories named in −−II options shall be
                 searched in the order specified. If the −−II option is used to
                 specify a directory that is one of the usual places searched
                 by default, the results are unspecified. Implementations
                 shall support at least ten instances of this option in a
                 single _c_9_9 command invocation.

       −−LL  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
                 Change the algorithm of searching for the libraries named in
                 the −−ll objects to look in the directory named by the
                 _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y pathname before looking in the usual places.
                 Directories named in −−LL options shall be searched in the
                 order specified. If the −−LL option is used to specify a
                 directory that is one of the usual places searched by
                 default, the results are unspecified. Implementations shall
                 support at least ten instances of this option in a single _c_9_9
                 command invocation. If a directory specified by a −−LL option
                 contains files with names starting with any of the strings
                 ""lliibbcc.."", ""lliibbll.."", ""lliibbpptthhrreeaadd.."", ""lliibbmm.."", ""lliibbrrtt.."",
                 ""lliibbttrraaccee.."", ""lliibbxxnneett.."", or ""lliibbyy.."", the results are
                 unspecified.

       −−ll  _l_i_b_r_a_r_y
                 Search the library named lliibblliibbrraarryy..aa.  A library shall be
                 searched when its name is encountered, so the placement of a
                 −−ll option is significant. Several standard libraries can be
                 specified in this manner, as described in the EXTENDED
                 DESCRIPTION section. Implementations may recognize
                 implementation-defined suffixes other than ..aa as denoting
                 libraries.

       −−OO  _o_p_t_l_e_v_e_l
                 Specify the level of code optimization. If the _o_p_t_l_e_v_e_l
                 option-argument is the digit ''00'', all special code
                 optimizations shall be disabled. If it is the digit ''11'', the
                 nature of the optimization is unspecified. If the −−OO option
                 is omitted, the nature of the system's default optimization
                 is unspecified. It is unspecified whether code generated in
                 the presence of the −−OO 0 option is the same as that generated
                 when −−OO is omitted. Other _o_p_t_l_e_v_e_l values may be supported.

       −−oo  _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
                 Use the pathname _o_u_t_f_i_l_e, instead of the default aa..oouutt, for
                 the executable file produced. If the −−oo option is present
                 with −−cc or −−EE, the result is unspecified.

       −−ss        Produce object or executable files, or both, from which
                 symbolic and other information not required for proper
                 execution using the _e_x_e_c family defined in the System
                 Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008 has been removed
                 (stripped). If both −−gg and −−ss options are present, the action
                 taken is unspecified.

       −−UU  _n_a_m_e   Remove any initial definition of _n_a_m_e.

       Multiple instances of the −−DD, −−II, −−LL, −−ll, and −−UU options can be
       specified.

OOPPEERRAANNDDSS
       The application shall ensure that at least one _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operand is
       specified. The following forms for _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operands shall be
       supported:

       _f_i_l_e_.cc    A C-language source file to be compiled and optionally
                 linked. The application shall ensure that the operand is of
                 this form if the −−cc option is used.

       _f_i_l_e_.aa    A library of object files typically produced by the _a_r
                 utility, and passed directly to the link editor.
                 Implementations may recognize implementation-defined suffixes
                 other than ..aa as denoting object file libraries.

       _f_i_l_e_.oo    An object file produced by _c_9_9 −−cc and passed directly to the
                 link editor. Implementations may recognize implementation-
                 defined suffixes other than ..oo as denoting object files.

       The processing of other files is implementation-defined.

SSTTDDIINN
       Not used.

IINNPPUUTT FFIILLEESS
       Each input file shall be one of the following: a text file containing a
       C-language source program, an object file in the format produced by _c_9_9
       −−cc, or a library of object files, in the format produced by archiving
       zero or more object files, using _a_r.  Implementations may supply
       additional utilities that produce files in these formats. Additional
       input file formats are implementation-defined.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of _c_9_9:

       _L_A_N_G      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _8_._2, _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n
                 _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s for the precedence of internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       _L_C___A_L_L    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       _L_C___C_T_Y_P_E  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input
                 files).

       _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
                 error.

       _N_L_S_P_A_T_H   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S.

       _T_M_P_D_I_R    Provide a pathname that should override the default directory
                 for temporary files, if any.  On XSI-conforming systems,
                 provide a pathname that shall override the default directory
                 for temporary files, if any.

AASSYYNNCCHHRROONNOOUUSS EEVVEENNTTSS
       Default.

SSTTDDOOUUTT
       If more than one _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operand ending in ..cc (or possibly other
       unspecified suffixes) is given, for each such file:


           ""%%ss::\\nn"",, <<_p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e>

       may be written. These messages, if written, shall precede the
       processing of each input file; they shall not be written to the
       standard output if they are written to the standard error, as described
       in the STDERR section.

       If the −−EE option is specified, the standard output shall be a text file
       that represents the results of the preprocessing stage of the language;
       it may contain extra information appropriate for subsequent compilation
       passes.

SSTTDDEERRRR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.  If more
       than one _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e operand ending in ..cc (or possibly other unspecified
       suffixes) is given, for each such file:


           ""%%ss::\\nn"",, <<_p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e>

       may be written to allow identification of the diagnostic and warning
       messages with the appropriate input file. These messages, if written,
       shall precede the processing of each input file; they shall not be
       written to the standard error if they are written to the standard
       output, as described in the STDOUT section.

       This utility may produce warning messages about certain conditions that
       do not warrant returning an error (non-zero) exit value.

OOUUTTPPUUTT FFIILLEESS
       Object files or executable files or both are produced in unspecified
       formats. If the pathname of an object file or executable file to be
       created by _c_9_9 resolves to an existing directory entry for a file that
       is not a regular file, it is unspecified whether _c_9_9 shall attempt to
       create the file or shall issue a diagnostic and exit with a non-zero
       exit status.

       The executable files created when these environments are selected shall
       be in a proper format for execution by the _e_x_e_c family of functions.
       Each environment may be one of the ones in _T_a_b_l_e _4_-_4_, _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g
       _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s_: _T_y_p_e _S_i_z_e_s, or it may be another environment. The names
       for the environments that meet this requirement shall be output by a
       _g_e_t_c_o_n_f command using the POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS argument, as a
       <newline>-separated list of names suitable for use with the _g_e_t_c_o_n_f −−vv
       option. If more than one environment meets the requirement, the names
       of all such environments shall be output on separate lines. Any of
       these names can then be used in a subsequent _g_e_t_c_o_n_f command to obtain
       the flags specific to that environment with the following suffixes
       added as appropriate:

       _CFLAGS   To get the C compiler flags.

       _LDFLAGS  To get the linker/loader flags.

       _LIBS     To get the libraries.

       This requirement may be removed in a future version.

       When this utility processes a file containing a function called _m_a_i_n(),
       it shall be defined with a return type equivalent to iinntt.  Using return
       from the initial call to _m_a_i_n() shall be equivalent (other than with
       respect to language scope issues) to calling _e_x_i_t() with the returned
       value. Reaching the end of the initial call to _m_a_i_n() shall be
       equivalent to calling _e_x_i_t(0).  The implementation shall not declare a
       prototype for this function.

       Implementations provide configuration strings for C compiler flags,
       linker/loader flags, and libraries for each supported environment.
       When an application needs to use a specific programming environment
       rather than the implementation default programming environment while
       compiling, the application shall first verify that the implementation
       supports the desired environment. If the desired programming
       environment is supported, the application shall then invoke _c_9_9 with
       the appropriate C compiler flags as the first options for the compile,
       the appropriate linker/loader flags after any other options except −−ll
       but before any operands or −−ll options, and the appropriate libraries at
       the end of the operands and −−ll options.

       Conforming applications shall not attempt to link together object files
       compiled for different programming models. Applications shall also be
       aware that binary data placed in shared memory or in files might not be
       recognized by applications built for other programming models.

       Since the _c_9_9 utility usually creates files in the current directory
       during the compilation process, it is typically necessary to run the
       _c_9_9 utility in a directory in which a file can be created.

       On systems providing POSIX Conformance (see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008, _C_h_a_p_t_e_r _2, _C_o_n_f_o_r_m_a_n_c_e), _c_9_9 is required only with the
       C-Language Development option; XSI-conformant systems always provide
       _c_9_9.

       Some historical implementations have created ..oo files when −−cc is not
       specified and more than one source file is given. Since this area is
       left unspecified, the application cannot rely on ..oo files being
       created, but it also must be prepared for any related ..oo files that
       already exist being deleted at the completion of the link edit.

       There is the possible implication that if a user supplies versions of
       the standard functions (before they would be encountered by an implicit
       −−ll  cc or explicit −−ll  mm), that those versions would be used in place of
       the standard versions.  There are various reasons this might not be
       true (functions defined as macros, manipulations for clean name space,
       and so on), so the existence of files named in the same manner as the
       standard libraries within the −−LL directories is explicitly stated to
       produce unspecified behavior.

       All of the functions specified in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 may be made visible by implementations when the Standard C
       Library is searched. Conforming applications must explicitly request
       searching the other standard libraries when functions made visible by
       those libraries are used.

       In the ISO C standard the mapping from physical source characters to
       the C source character set is implementation-defined. Implementations
       may strip white-space characters before the terminating <newline> of a
       (physical) line as part of this mapping and, as a consequence of this,
       one or more white-space characters (and no other characters) between a
       <backslash> character and the <newline> character that terminates the
       line produces implementation-defined results. Portable applications
       should not use such constructs.

       Some _c_9_9 compilers not conforming to POSIX.1‐2008 do not support
       trigraphs by default.

        3. The following examples clarify the use and interactions of −−LL and
           −−ll options.

           Consider the case in which module aa..cc calls function _f() in library
           lliibbQQ..aa, and module bb..cc calls function _g() in library lliibbpp..aa.
           Assume that both libraries reside in //aa//bb//cc.  The command line to
           compile and link in the desired way is:


               cc9999 −−LL //aa//bb//cc mmaaiinn..oo aa..cc −−ll QQ bb..cc −−ll pp

           In this case the −−LL option need only precede the first −−ll option,
           since both lliibbQQ..aa and lliibbpp..aa reside in the same directory.

           Multiple −−LL options can be used when library name collisions occur.
           Building on the previous example, suppose that the user wants to
           use a new lliibbpp..aa, in //aa//aa//aa, but still wants _f() from
           //aa//bb//cc//lliibbQQ..aa:


               cc9999 −−LL //aa//aa//aa −−LL //aa//bb//cc mmaaiinn..oo aa..cc −−ll QQ bb..cc −−ll pp

           In this example, the linker searches the −−LL options in the order
           specified, and finds //aa//aa//aa//lliibbpp..aa before //aa//bb//cc//lliibbpp..aa when
           resolving references for bb..cc.  The order of the −−ll options is still
           important, however.

        4. The following example shows how an application can use a
           programming environment where the widths of the following types:
           bbllkkssiizzee__tt, cccc__tt, mmooddee__tt, nnffddss__tt, ppiidd__tt, ppttrrddiiffff__tt, ssiizzee__tt, ssppeeeedd__tt,
           ssssiizzee__tt, ssuusseeccoonnddss__tt, ttccffllaagg__tt, wwcchhaarr__tt, wwiinntt__tt

           are no greater than the width of type lloonngg:


               ## FFiirrsstt cchhoooossee oonnee ooff tthhee lliisstteedd eennvviirroonnmmeennttss ......

               # ... if there are no additional constraints, the first one will do:
               CENV=$(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS | head -n l)

               # ... or, if an environment that supports large files is preferred,
               # look for names that contain "OFF64" or "OFFBIG". (This chooses
               # the last one in the list if none match.)
               for CENV in $(getconf POSIX_V7_WIDTH_RESTRICTED_ENVS)
               do
                   case $CENV in
                   *OFF64*|*OFFBIG*) break ;;
                   esac
               done

               # The chosen environment name can now be used like this:

               c99 $(getconf ${CENV}_CFLAGS) -D _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LDFLAGS) foo.c -o foo \
               $(getconf ${CENV}_LIBS)

       The _c_9_9 utility is based on the _c_8_9 utility originally introduced in
       the ISO POSIX‐2:1993 standard.

       Some of the changes from _c_8_9 include the ability to intersperse options
       and operands (which many _c_8_9 implementations allowed despite it not
       being specified), the description of −−ll as an option instead of an
       operand, and the modification to the contents of the Standard Libraries
       section to account for new headers and options; for example, _<_s_p_a_w_n_._h_>
       added to the description of −−ll  rrtt, and −−ll  ttrraaccee added for the Tracing
       option.

       POSIX.1‐2008 specifies that the _c_9_9 utility must be able to use regular
       files for **..oo files and for aa..oouutt files. Implementations are free to
       overwrite existing files of other types when attempting to create
       object files and executable files, but are not required to do so. If
       something other than a regular file is specified and using it fails for
       any reason, _c_9_9 is required to issue a diagnostic message and exit with
       a non-zero exit status. But for some file types, the problem may not be
       noticed for a long time. For example, if a FIFO named aa..oouutt exists in
       the current directory, _c_9_9 may attempt to open aa..oouutt and will hang in
       the _o_p_e_n() call until another process opens the FIFO for reading. Then
       _c_9_9 may write most of the aa..oouutt to the FIFO and fail when it tries to
       seek back close to the start of the file to insert a timestamp (FIFOs
       are not seekable files). The _c_9_9 utility is also allowed to issue a
       diagnostic immediately if it encounters an aa..oouutt or **..oo file that is
       not a regular file. For portable use, applications should ensure that
       any aa..oouutt, −−oo option-argument, or **..oo files corresponding to any **..cc
       files do not conflict with names already in use that are not regular
       files or symbolic links that point to regular files.

       On many systems, multi-threaded applications run in a programming
       environment that is distinct from that used by single-threaded
       applications. This multi-threaded programming environment (in addition
       to needing to specify −−ll pptthhrreeaadd at link time) may require additional
       flags to be set when headers are processed at compile time
       (−−DD__RREEEENNTTRRAANNTT being common). This programming environment is orthogonal
       to the type size programming environments discussed above and listed in
       _T_a_b_l_e _4_-_4_, _P_r_o_g_r_a_m_m_i_n_g _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t_s_: _T_y_p_e _S_i_z_e_s.  This version of the
       standard adds _g_e_t_c_o_n_f utility calls to provide the C compiler flags and
       linker/loader flags needed to support multi-threaded applications. Note
       that on a system where single-threaded applications are a special case
       of a multi-threaded application, both of these _g_e_t_c_o_n_f calls may return
       NULL strings; on other implementations both of these strings may be
       non-NULL strings.

       The C standardization committee invented trigraphs (e.g., ""????!!"" to
       represent ''||'') to address character portability problems in development
       environments based on national variants of the 7-bit ISO/IEC 646:1991
       standard character set. However, these environments were already
       obsolete by the time the first ISO C standard was published, and in
       practice trigraphs have not been used for their intended purpose, and
       usually are intended to have their original meaning in K&R C.  For
       example, in practice a C-language source string like ""WWhhaatt????!!"" is
       usually intended to end in two <question-mark> characters and an
       <exclamation-mark>, not in ''||''.
