BBOX(1)                                                                                   PS2EPS                                                                                  BBOX(1)

NAME
       bbox - prints out the bounding box of a rawppm or rawpbm image

SYNOPSIS
       bbox [-l] [-r] [-h] [-V] [rawpbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       bbox reads a rawppm or rawpbm file and prints out the bounding box of the image (as postscript comment and in postscript points, i.e. 1/72dpi) as well as the high resolution
       bounding box. Input is read from standard input if no filename is specified. Example output:

                  %%BoundingBox: 12 253 829 837
                  %%HiResBoundingBox: 12.500000 253.000000 828.500000 837.00000

       bbox has only very limited memory requirements as it reads the input line by line and thus needs to store only one picture line in memory.
