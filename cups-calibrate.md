NAME
       cups-calibrate - ESP CUPS Printer Calibration Tool

SYNOPSIS
       cups-calibrate

DESCRIPTION
       This program allows you to calibrate the color output of printers using the Gutenprint CUPS or ESP Print Pro drivers.

       Please note that this program only works with the Gutenprint CUPS or ESP Print Pro drivers. If you are using the Gutenprint stp or ijsgimm‐
       print driver for GhostScript or the drivers for the Gutenprint Print plug-in for The GIMP, the calibration will not work.

       These drivers are identified by the text CUPS+Gutenprint or ESP Print Pro in the model description displayed by  the  CUPS  web  interface,
       KUPS, the ESP Print Pro Printer Manager, or printerdrake.

       To make a calibration profile for all users, run this program as the root user.  The program displays a series of prompts which should sim‐
       ply be followed.
