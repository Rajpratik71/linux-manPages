ROUTEL(8)                           Linux                           ROUTEL(8)

NAME
       routel - list routes with pretty output format
       routef - flush routes

SYNTAX
       routel [tablenr [raw ip args...]]
       routef

DESCRIPTION
       These  programs are a set of helper scripts you can use instead of raw
       iproute2 commands.
       The routel script will list routes in a format that  some  might  con‐
       sider easier to interpret then the ip route list equivalent.
       The  routef  script  does not take any arguments and will simply flush
       the routing table down the drain.  Beware!  This  means  deleting  all
       routes which will make your network unusable!
