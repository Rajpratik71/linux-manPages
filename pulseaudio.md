DESCRIPTION
       PulseAudio is a networked low-latency sound server for Linux, POSIX and Windows systems.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show help.

       --version
              Show version information.

       --dump-conf
              Load the daemon configuration file daemon.conf (see below), parse remaining configuration options on the command line and dump the resulting daemon configuration, in a format that is com‐
              patible with daemon.conf.

       --dump-modules
              List available loadable modules. Combine with -v for a more elaborate listing.

       --dump-resample-methods
              List available audio resamplers.

       --cleanup-shm
              Identify stale PulseAudio POSIX shared memory segments in /dev/shm and remove them if possible. This is done implicitly whenever a new daemon starts up or a client tries to connect  to  a
              daemon.  It  should  normally  not be necessary to issue this command by hand. Only available on systems with POSIX shared memory segments implemented via a virtual file system mounted to
              /dev/shm (e.g. Linux).

       --start
              Start PulseAudio if it is not running yet. This is different from starting PulseAudio without --start which would fail if PA is already running. PulseAudio is guaranteed to be fully  ini‐
              tialized when this call returns. Implies --daemonize.

       -k | --kill
              Kill an already running PulseAudio daemon of the calling user (Equivalent to sending a SIGTERM).

       --check
              Return 0 as return code when the PulseAudio daemon is already running for the calling user, or non-zero otherwise. Produces no output on the console except for errors to stderr.

       --system[=BOOL]
              Run  as  system-wide  instance  instead  of per-user. Please note that this disables certain features of PulseAudio and is generally not recommended unless the system knows no local users
              (e.g. is a thin client). This feature needs special configuration and a dedicated UNIX user set up. It is highly recommended to combine this with --disallow-module-loading (see below).

       -D | --daemonize[=BOOL]
              Daemonize after startup, i.e. detach from the terminal. Note that when running as a systemd service you should use --daemonize=no for systemd notification to work.

       --fail[=BOOL]
              Fail startup when any of the commands specified in the startup script default.pa (see below) fails.

       --high-priority[=BOOL]
              Try to acquire a high Unix nice level. This will only succeed if the calling user has a non-zero RLIMIT_NICE resource limit set (on systems that support this), or we're called  SUID  root
              (see below), or we are configure to be run as system daemon (see --system above). It is recommended to enable this, since it is only a negligible security risk (see below).

       --realtime[=BOOL]
              Try  to  acquire  a  real-time scheduling for PulseAudio's I/O threads. This will only succeed if the calling user has a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit set (on systems that support
              this), or we're called SUID root (see below), or we are configure to be run as system daemon (see --system above). It is recommended to enable this only for trusted users, since it  is  a
              major security risk (see below).

       --disallow-module-loading[=BOOL]
              Disallow  module  loading after startup. This is a security feature since it disallows additional module loading during runtime and on user request. It is highly recommended when --system
              is used (see above). Note however, that this breaks certain features like automatic module loading on hot plug.

       --disallow-exit[=BOOL]
              Disallow user requested exit

       --exit-idle-time=SECS
              Terminate the daemon when idle and the specified number of seconds passed.

       --scache-idle-time=SECS
              Unload autoloaded samples from the cache when the haven't been used for the specified number of seconds.

       --log-level[=LEVEL]
              If an argument is passed, set the log level to the specified value, otherwise increase the configured verbosity level by one. The log levels are numerical from 0 to  4,  corresponding  to
              error, warn, notice, info, debug. Default log level is notice, i.e. all log messages with lower log levels are printed: error, warn, notice.

       -v | --verbose
              Increase the configured verbosity level by one (see --log-level above). Specify multiple times to increase log level multiple times.

       --log-target={auto,syslog,journal,stderr,file:PATH,newfile:PATH}
              Specify the log target. If set to auto (which is the default), then logging is directed to syslog when --daemonize is passed, otherwise to STDERR. If set to journal logging is directed to
              the systemd journal. If set to file:PATH, logging is directed to the file indicated by PATH. newfile:PATH is otherwise the same as file:PATH, but existing files are never overwritten.  If
              the specified file already exists, a suffix is added to the file name to avoid overwriting.

       --log-meta[=BOOL]
              Show source code location in log messages.

       --log-time[=BOOL]
              Show timestamps in log messages.

       --log-backtrace=FRAMES
              When FRAMES is greater than 0, log for each message a stack trace up to the number of specified stack frames.

       -p | --dl-search-path=PATH
              Set the search path for dynamic shared objects (plugins).

       --resample-method=METHOD
              Use the specified resampler by default (See --dump-resample-methods above for possible values).

       --use-pid-file[=BOOL]
              Create a PID file. If this options is disabled it is possible to run multiple sound servers per user.

       --no-cpu-limit[=BOOL]
              Do  not install CPU load limiter on platforms that support it. By default, PulseAudio will terminate itself when it notices that it takes up too much CPU time. This is useful as a protec‐
              tion against system lockups when real-time scheduling is used (see below). Disabling this mechanism is useful when debugging PulseAudio with tools like valgrind(1) which slow down  execu‐
              tion.

       --disable-shm[=BOOL]
              PulseAudio  clients  and the server can exchange audio data via POSIX shared memory segments (on systems that support this). If disabled PulseAudio will communicate exclusively over sock‐
              ets. Please note that data transfer via shared memory segments is always disabled when PulseAudio is running with --system enabled (see above).

       -L | --load="MODULE ARGUMENTS"
              Load the specified plugin module with the specified arguments.

       -F | --file=FILENAME
              Run the specified script on startup. May be specified multiple times to specify multiple scripts to be run in order. Combine with -n to disable loading of the  default  script  default.pa
              (see below).

       -C     Open a command interpreter on STDIN/STDOUT after startup. This may be used to configure PulseAudio dynamically during runtime. Equivalent to --load=module-cli.

       -n     Don't load default script file default.pa (see below) on startup. Useful in conjunction with -C or --file.

FILES
       ~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf, /etc/pulse/daemon.conf: configuration settings for the PulseAudio daemon. If the version in the user's home directory does not exist the global configuration file is
       loaded. See pulse-daemon.conf(5) for more information.

       ~/.config/pulse/default.pa, /etc/pulse/default.pa: the default configuration script to execute when the PulseAudio daemon is started. If the version in the user's home directory does  not  exist
       the global configuration script is loaded. See default.pa(5) for more information.

       ~/.config/pulse/client.conf,  /etc/pulse/client.conf:  configuration settings for PulseAudio client applications. If the version in the user's home directory does not exist the global configura‐
       tion file is loaded. See pulse-client.conf(5) for more information.

SIGNALS
       SIGINT, SIGTERM: the PulseAudio daemon will shut down (Same as --kill).

       SIGHUP: dump a long status report to STDOUT or syslog, depending on the configuration.

       SIGUSR1: load module-cli, allowing runtime reconfiguration via STDIN/STDOUT.

       SIGUSR2: load module-cli-protocol-unix, allowing runtime reconfiguration via a AF_UNIX socket. See pacmd(1) for more information.

UNIX GROUPS AND USERS
       Group pulse-rt: if the PulseAudio binary is marked SUID root, then membership of the calling user in this group decides whether real-time and/or high-priority scheduling is enabled. Please  note
       that enabling real-time scheduling is a security risk (see below).

       Group pulse-access: if PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see --system above) access is granted to members of this group when they connect via AF_UNIX sockets. If PulseAudio is running as
       a user daemon this group has no meaning.

       User pulse, group pulse: if PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see --system above) and is started as root the daemon will drop privileges and become a normal user process using this  user
       and group. If PulseAudio is running as a user daemon this user and group has no meaning.

REAL-TIME AND HIGH-PRIORITY SCHEDULING
       To  minimize  the risk of drop-outs during playback it is recommended to run PulseAudio with real-time scheduling if the underlying platform supports it. This decouples the scheduling latency of
       the PulseAudio daemon from the system load and is thus the best way to make sure that PulseAudio always gets CPU time when it needs it to refill the hardware playback buffers. Unfortunately this
       is a security risk on most systems, since PulseAudio runs as user process, and giving realtime scheduling privileges to a user process always comes with the risk that the user misuses it to lock
       up the system -- which is possible since making a process real-time effectively disables preemption.

       To minimize the risk PulseAudio by default does not enable real-time scheduling. It is however recommended to enable it on trusted systems. To do  that  start  PulseAudio  with  --realtime  (see
       above)  or  enabled the appropriate option in daemon.conf. Since acquiring realtime scheduling is a privileged operation on most systems, some special changes to the system configuration need to
       be made to allow them to the calling user. Two options are available:

       On newer Linux systems the system resource limit RLIMIT_RTPRIO (see setrlimit(2) for more information) can be used to allow specific users to acquire real-time scheduling. This can be configured
       in /etc/security/limits.conf, a resource limit of 9 is recommended.

       Alternatively,  the SUID root bit can be set for the PulseAudio binary. Then, the daemon will drop root privileges immediately on startup, however retain the CAP_NICE capability (on systems that
       support it), but only if the calling user is a member of the pulse-rt group (see above). For all other users all capabilities are dropped immediately. The advantage of this solution is that  the
       real-time privileges are only granted to the PulseAudio daemon -- not to all the user's processes.

       Alternatively, if the risk of locking up the machine is considered too big to enable real-time scheduling, high-priority scheduling can be enabled instead (i.e. negative nice level). This can be
       enabled by passing --high-priority (see above) when starting PulseAudio and may also be enabled with the appropriate option in daemon.conf. Negative nice levels can  only  be  enabled  when  the
       appropriate  resource  limit  RLIMIT_NICE  is set (see setrlimit(2) for more information), possibly configured in /etc/security/limits.conf. A resource limit of 31 (corresponding with nice level
       -11) is recommended.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The PulseAudio client libraries check for the existence of the following environment variables and change their local configuration accordingly:

       $PULSE_SERVER: the server string specifying the server to connect to when a client asks for a sound server connection and doesn't explicitly ask for a specific server. The  server  string  is  a
       list  of server addresses separated by whitespace which are tried in turn. A server address consists of an optional address type specifier (unix:, tcp:, tcp4:, tcp6:), followed by a path or host
       address. A host address may include an optional port number. A server address may be prefixed by a string enclosed in {}. In this case the following server address is ignored unless  the  prefix
       string equals the local hostname or the machine id (/etc/machine-id).

       $PULSE_SINK: the symbolic name of the sink to connect to when a client creates a playback stream and doesn't explicitly ask for a specific sink.

       $PULSE_SOURCE: the symbolic name of the source to connect to when a client creates a record stream and doesn't explicitly ask for a specific source.

       $PULSE_BINARY: path of PulseAudio executable to run when server auto-spawning is used.

       $PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG: path of file that shall be read instead of client.conf (see above) for client configuration.

       $PULSE_COOKIE: path of file that contains the PulseAudio authentication cookie. Defaults to ~/.config/pulse/cookie.

       These environment settings take precedence -- if set -- over the configuration settings from client.conf (see above).
