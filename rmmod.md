NAME
       rmmod - Simple program to remove a module from the Linux Kernel

SYNOPSIS
       rmmod [-f] [-s] [-v] [modulename]

DESCRIPTION
       rmmod is a trivial program to remove a module (when module unloading support is provided) from
       the kernel. Most users will want to use modprobe(8) with the -r option instead.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Print messages about what the program is doing. Usually rmmod prints messages only if
           something goes wrong.

       -f, --force
           This option can be extremely dangerous: it has no effect unless CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
           was set when the kernel was compiled. With this option, you can remove modules which are
           being used, or which are not designed to be removed, or have been marked as unsafe (see
           lsmod(8)).

       -s, --syslog
           Send errors to syslog instead of standard error.

       -V --version
           Show version of program and exit.
