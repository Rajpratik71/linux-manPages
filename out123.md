NAME
       out123 - send raw PCM audio or a waveform pattern to an output device

SYNOPSIS
       cat audio.raw | out123 [ options ]

       out123 --wave-freq freq1[,freq2,...]  [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       out123  reads  raw PCM data (in host byte order) from standard input and plays it on the audio device specified by given options.  Alterna‐
       tively, it can generate periodic signals for playback itself.

OPTIONS
       out123 options may be either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or the GNU style long options.  POSIX style  options  start  with  a
       single  ``-'',  while  GNU  long options start with ``--''.  Option arguments (if needed) follow separated by whitespace (not ``='').  Note
       that some options can be absent from your installation when disabled in the build process.

       --name name
              Set the name of this instance, possibly used in various places. This sets the client name for JACK output.

       -o module, --output module
              Select audio output module. You can provide a comma-separated list to use the first one that works.

       --list-modules
              List the available modules.

       -a dev, --audiodevice dev
              Specify the audio device to use.  The default is system-dependent (usually /dev/audio or /dev/dsp).  Use this  option  if  you  have
              multiple audio devices and the default is not what you want.

       -s, --stdout
              The  audio  samples are written to standard output, instead of playing them through the audio device.  The output format is the same
              as the input ... so in this mode, out123 acts like the standard tool  cat.  This shortcut is equivalent to ``-o raw -a -''.

       -O file, --outfile
              Write raw output into a file (instead of simply redirecting standard output to a file with the shell).  This shortcut is  equivalent
              to ``-o raw -a file''.

       -w file, --wav
              Write  output  as  WAV file file , or standard output if - is or the empty string used as file name. You can also use --au and --cdr
              for AU and CDR format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU writing to non-seekable files or redirected stdout  needs  some  thought.  The
              header  is written with the first actual data. The result of decoding nothing to WAV/AU is a file consisting just of the header when
              it is seekable and really nothing when not (not even a header). Correctly writing data with prophetic headers to stdout is  no  easy
              business.  This shortcut is equivalent to ``-o wav -a file''.

       --au file
              Write  to  file  in SUN audio format.  If - or the empty string is used as the filename, the AU file is written to stdout. See para‐
              graph about WAV writing for header fun with non-seekable streams.  This shortcut is equivalent to ``-o au -a file''.

       --cdr file
              Write to file as a CDR (CD-ROM audio, more correctly CDDA for Compact Disc Digital Audio).  If - is or the empty string used as  the
              filename, the CDR file is written to stdout.  This shortcut is equivalent to ``-o cdr -a file''.

       -r rate, --rate rate
              Set  sample  rate  in  Hz  (default:  44100). If this does not match the actual input sampling rate, you get changed pitch. Might be
              intentional;-)

       -c count, --channels count
              Set channel count to given value.

       -e enc, --encoding enc
              Choose output sample encoding. Possible values look like f32 (32-bit floating point),  s32  (32-bit  signed  integer),  u32  (32-bit
              unsigned  integer)  and the variants with different numbers of bits (s24, u24, s16, u16, s8, u8) and also special variants like ulaw
              and alaw 8-bit.  See the output of out123's longhelp for actually available encodings.  Default is s16.

       -m, --mono
              Set for single-channel audio (default is two channels, stereo).

       --stereo
              Select stereo output (2 channels, default).

       --list-encodings
              List known encoding short and long names to standard output.

       --test-format
              Check if given format is supported by given driver and device (in command line before encountering this), silently  returning  0  as
              exit value if it is the case.

       --test-encodings
              Print out the short names of encodings supported with the current setup.

       --query-format
              If  the  selected  driver  and device communicate some default accepted format, print out a command line fragment for out123 setting
              that format, always in that order: --rate <r> --channels <c> --encoding <e>

       -o h, --headphones
              Direct audio output to the headphone connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       -o s, --speaker
              Direct audio output to the speaker  (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       -o l, --lineout
              Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       -b size, --buffer size
              Use an audio output buffer of size Kbytes.  This is useful to bypass short periods of heavy system activity,  which  would  normally
              cause  the  audio output to be interrupted.  You should specify a buffer size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about 6 sec‐
              onds of usual audio data) or more; less than about 300 does not make much sense.  The default is 0, which turns buffering off.

       --preload fraction
              Wait for the buffer to be filled to fraction before starting playback (fraction between 0 and 1). You can tune this prebuffering  to
              either get sound faster to your ears or safer uninterrupted web radio.  Default is 0.2 (changed from 1 since version 1.23).

       --devbuffer seconds
              Set device buffer in seconds; <= 0 means default value. This is the small buffer between the application and the audio backend, pos‐
              sibly directly related to hardware buffers.

       --timelimit samples
              Set playback time limit in PCM samples if set to a value greater than zero.  out123 will stop reading from stdin or playing from the
              generated wave table after reaching that number of samples.

       --wave-freq frequencies
              Set  wave generator frequency or list of those with comma separation for enabling a generated test signal instead of standard input.
              Empty values repeat the previous one.

       --wave-pat patterns
              Set the waveform patterns of the generated waves as comma-separated list.  Choices include sine, square, triangle, sawtooth,  gauss,
              pulse, and shot.  Empty values repeat the previous one.

       --wave-phase phases
              Set  waveform  phase  shift(s)  as comma-separated list, negative values inverting the pattern in time and empty value repeating the
              previous.

       --wave-limit samples
              Set a custom soft limit on the wave table size. Small values cause larger changes in actual frequencies to make whole periods fit.

       -t, --test
              Test mode.  The audio stream is read, but no output occurs.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the verbosity level.

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.

       --aggressive
              Tries to get higher priority

       -T, --realtime
              Tries to gain realtime priority.  This option usually requires root privileges to have any effect.

       -?, --help
              Shows short usage instructions.

       --longhelp
              Shows long usage instructions.

       --version
              Print the version string.
