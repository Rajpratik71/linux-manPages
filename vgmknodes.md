NAME
       vgmknodes — recreate volume group directory and logical volume special files

SYNOPSIS
       vgmknodes  [--commandprofile  ProfileName] [-d|--debug] [-h|--help] [--refresh] [--reportformat {basic|json}] [-v|--verbose] [[VolumeGroup‐
       Name|LogicalVolumePath]...]

DESCRIPTION
       Checks the LVM2 special files in /dev that are needed for active logical volumes and creates any missing ones and removes unused ones.

OPTIONS
       See lvm(8) for common options.

       --refresh
              If any logical volume in the volume group is active, reload its metadata.  This is not necessary in normal  operation,  but  may  be
              useful if something has gone wrong or if you're doing clustering manually without a clustered lock manager.
