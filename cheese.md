NAME
       cheese - tool to take pictures and videos from your webcam

SYNOPSIS
       cheese [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       cheese uses your webcam to take photos and videos, applies fancy special effects and lets you
       share the fun with others. It was written as part of Google's 2007 Summer of Code lead by
       daniel g. siegel and mentored by RaphaÃ«l Slinckx. Under the hood, Cheese uses GStreamer to
       apply fancy effects to photos and videos. With Cheese it is easy to take photos of you, your
       friends, pets or whatever you want and share them with others. After the success of the Summer
       of Code, the development continued and we are still looking for people with nice ideas and
       patches ;)
