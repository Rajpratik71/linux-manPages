NAME
       radvd - router advertisement daemon for IPv6

SYNOPSIS
       radvd [ -hsvc ] [ -d debuglevel ] [ -C configfile ] [ -p pidfile ] [ -m logmethod ] [ -l logfile ] [ -f facility ] [ -t chrootdir ] [ -u username ]


DESCRIPTION
       radvd  is  the router advertisement daemon for IPv6. It listens to router solicitations and sends router advertisements as described in "Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6)" (RFC 4861).  With
       these advertisements hosts can automatically configure their addresses and some other parameters. It also defines "Neighbor Discovery Optimization for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Net‐
       works (6LoWPANs)" (RFC6775).  They also can choose a default router based on these advertisements.

       The configuration file must not be writable by others, and if non-root operation is requested, not even by self/own group.


OPTIONS
       For every one character option there is also a long option, which is listed right next to the "short" option name:


       -v, --version
              Displays the version of radvd and then aborts.

       -h, --help
              Displays a short usage description and then aborts.

       -c, --configtest
              Test configuration and do startup tests and then exit.

       -d debuglevel, --debug debuglevel
              With this option you turn on debugging information. The debugging level is an integer in the range from 1 to 5, from  quiet to very verbose. A debugging level of 0 completely turns off debug‐
              ging. If a debugging level greater than 0 is used, radvd doesn't background itself on start. The default debugging level is 0.

       -C configfile, --config configfile
              Specifies an alternate config file. Normally the compiled in default /etc/radvd.conf is used.

       -p pidfile, --pidfile pidfile
              Specifies an alternate pidfile. Normally the compiled in default /var/run/radvd/radvd.pid is used.

       -m method, --logmethod method
              Specifies the logging method to use. Possibly values are:

              none   Completely disables any logging.

              logfile
                     Logs to the logfile which is specified by the -l option. If no logfile is specified on the command line, then a compiled in default is used (see next option).

              stderr Logs to standard error.

              stderr_syslog
                     Logs only the high messages (of at least LOG_ERR priority) to standard error, and everything to syslog (default method).

              syslog Logs to syslog.

       -l logfile, --logfile logfile
              Specifies the logfile to use when using the logging method logfile.  The default logfile is /var/log/radvd.log.

       -f facility, --facility facility
              Specifies the facility (as an integer) when using syslog logging. Default is LOG_DAEMON.

       -t chrootdir, --chrootdir chrootdir
              If specified, switches to chrootdir before doing anything else.  This directory and its subdirectories must have been populated first.  For security reasons, -u must always be used when using
              chrootdir.

              Note that on Linux radvd requires access to the /proc filesystem, so it is more challenging to set up the chroot environment.

       -u username, --username username
              If specified, drops root privileges and changes user ID to username and group ID to the primary group of username.  This is recommended for security reasons.  You might also need to use -p to
              point to a file in a username -writable directory (e.g. /var/run/radvd/radvd.pid).

FILES
       /usr/sbin/radvd
       /etc/radvd.conf
       /var/run/radvd/radvd.pid
       /var/log/radvd.log

       There certainly are some bugs. If you find them or have other suggestions please contact Reuben Hawkins <reubenhwk@gmail.com>.
