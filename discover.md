Description
       discover provides an extensible hardware detection and reporting interface.  Hardware  informa‐
       tion is stored in an XML data format and can be retrieved across the network.

       Fundamental modes of operation:

          •  Display a list of hardware devices based on type of device or system bus on which the de‐
             vices reside, via --type-summary or --bus-summary (the latter of which is the default be‐
             havior).

          •  Query specified data for attached hardware, via --data-path.

Options
       -h | --help
                 Display a simple help message.

       -v | --verbose
                 Instruct  the tool to provide feedback as it operates. This will affect the output as
                 discover parses certain arguments, so this should appear early in the command line.

       -V | --version
                 Display the tool name and version.

       -b | --bus-summary
                 This is the default behavior: Display basic information regarding all devices on  the
                 appropriate buses. See "Selecting Buses" >.

       -t | --type-summary
                 Summarize devices by class of hardware. Examples of valid device types include broad‐
                 band, fixeddisk, display, and network.  See "Device Types" >.

       --data-path=path/to/data
                 Query matching devices for detailed information.  Device-specific data is stored in a
                 hierarchical  fashion,  and the query argument comprises strings naming each level in
                 that hierarchy.

                 Typically, the top-level component of the data path will  be  the  ``platform''  that
                 will  need  the  information,  such as linux or xfree86. For example, to retrieve the
                 Linux kernel module name for a piece of hardware, the --data-path argument  would  be
                 linux/module/name.

                 If  multiple  --data-path            arguments  are  given  and no format string (see
                 --format) is provided, only the last path is used.

                 See also the --data-version           argument.

       --data-version=version
                 Specify a version string for the platform that will use the information specified  by
                 the argument to --data-path.

                 This string must be in dotted-decimal notation in order to be matched against a range
                 of values, and thus may be shorter than the real version.

       --format=format string
                 Dictate the output of the results of the queries specified by --data-path  arguments.
                 This  format  string should follow printf(3) specifications, although only %s and ap‐
                 propriate flags, precision, and width values are supported (or make  sense);  literal
                 text  and %%           can also be used.  The behavior when the string is poorly for‐
                 matted is undefined.  See also --normalize-whitespace.

       -d | --disable-bus=bus
                 Use this option to override the list of buses to scan by default as defined  in  dis‐
                 cover.conf.  Use all as an argument to disable all buses; this is useful only if fol‐
                 lowed by --enable-bus (or -e) arguments.

       -e | --enable-bus=bus
                 Specify a bus to be scanned.

       --insert-url=url
                 Insert a URL at the head of the list of network resources to include  in  the  search
                 for  hardware  information.  Earlier data overrides later data; to override the local
                 data sources, insert URLs into the list.  See also --append-url.

       --append-url=url
                 Append a URL to the end of the list of network resources to search for  hardware  in‐
                 formation. See also --insert-url.

       --model   Include the model description in summary information. This is enabled by default.

       --model-id
                 Include the numeric model identifier in summary information.

       --no-model
                 Do not include the model description in summary information.

       --no-model-id
                 Do  not  include the numeric model identifier in summary information. This is the de‐
                 fault.

       --vendor  Include the vendor description in summary information. This is enabled by default.

       --vendor-id
                 Include the numeric vendor identifier in summary information.

       --no-vendor
                 Do not include the vendor description in summary information.

       --no-vendor-id
                 Do not include the numeric vendor identifier in summary information. This is the  de‐
                 fault.

       --normalize-whitespace
                 Consolidate  whitespace in the results of a --data-path query.  The default is not to
                 do so, which faithfully reproduces all text in the raw XML data.

                 With this option enabled, leading and trailing whitespace is removed, and any consec‐
                 utive internal whitespaces are compressed to a single space character.

Selecting Buses
       discover.conf  defines  two lists of system buses: one to scan by default (used by the discover
       command), and one never to scan (used by the Discover library).

       You can override and/or extend the list of default buses with --disable-bus  and  --enable-bus.
       The list of buses not to scan cannot be overridden without changing discover.conf, so that list
       should be used only for buses that may be dangerous to probe.

       Both arguments take the string ``all'' as a value.

       If a bus summary is being performed, which is indicated either by the presence of --bus-summary
       or  the absence of --type-summary and --data-path, any unattached arguments on the command line
       will be interpreted as the only buses to scan.  This is equivalent to using  --disable-bus  all
       before invoking --enable-bus     for the buses of interest.

       The following buses are currently supported by Discover:

          •  ata

          •  pci

          •  pcmcia

          •  scsi

          •  usb

Device Types
       Discover  defines  its own device types, to which the device types used by each bus are mapped.
       Discover     currently recognizes the following device types:

          •  audio

                 A device capable of producing an analog or digital sound signal is an  audio  device.
                 Typically,  any device commonly referred to as a ``sound card'' is classified by Dis‐
                 cover as an audio device.

          •  bridge

                 A device that provides access to devices of a different type, commonly on a different
                 bus,  is a bridge device.  For instance, consumer PCI chipsets often feature a bridge
                 to ATA (also known as IDE) devices.

          •  broadband

                 An interface device to a computer communications network  implemented  on  top  of  a
                 technology not explicitly designed for that purpose is a broadband     device.  Exam‐
                 ples include ISDN terminal adapters as well  as  DSL  and  cable  ``modems'';  analog
                 phone-line modems are not included in this classification (see ``modem'' below).

          •  display

                 A  device  controlled by the host machine's CPU and capable of producing an analog or
                 digital video signal for output purposes is a display device.  Typically, any  device
                 commonly  referred  to as a ``video card'' is classified by Discover as a display de‐
                 vice.

          •  fixeddisk

                 A high-speed, fixed magnetic storage device such as a hard disk drive is a  fixeddisk
                 device.   Removable media devices such as floppy disk drives, CD-ROM drives, magneto-
                 optical devices, tape drives, and Compact Flash card readers are not included in this
                 classification.

          •  humaninput

                 A  device  that  receives  tactile input from a person for the purpose of directing a
                 computer's activity is a humaninput device.  Examples include keyboards, mice, track‐
                 balls,  joysticks, gamepads, digital tablets manipulated with a stylus or finger, and
                 so forth.  Input devices that rely upon non-tactile means of determining  a  person's
                 intent, such as speech-recognition devices or cameras, are not included in this clas‐
                 sification.

          •  imaging

                 A device that captures still images for input purposes is an imaging  device.   Scan‐
                 ners  and  digital  cameras  are examples of imaging devices.  Motion-capture devices
                 such as television tuner cards, webcams, and digital video cameras are  not  included
                 in this classification.

          •  miscellaneous

                 Any  device that cannot logically be classified as another device type is a miscella‐
                 neous     device.

          •  modem

                 An analog phone-line modulator/demodulator (modem) is classified by Discover as a mo‐
                 dem device.  No other kind of device is so classified.

          •  network

                 An  interface device to a conventional computer data communications network that does
                 not require the use of a terminal adapter is a network device.  For example, Ethernet
                 and  Token  Ring  network  interface  cards  are  network devices.  Analog phone-line
                 modems; terminal adapters for technologies such as ISDN and DSL; and ``cable modems''
                 are not ``network'' devices.

          •  optical

                 An  optical-technology storage device, often using read-only media, is an optical de‐
                 vice.  By far the most common examples  of  these  devices  are  CD-ROM  and  DVD-ROM
                 drives,  including  versions  of  these  drives  that can ``burn'' (write to) optical
                 discs.

          •  printer

                 A device that renders visual output in a permanent  or  semi-permanent  manner  to  a
                 physical  medium  is  a printer.  Typically, any device colloquially referred to as a
                 ``printer'' is also classified by Discover as a printer.

          •  removabledisk

                 Storage devices that feature removable media using just about any  technology  except
                 that  of  magnetic tape, CD-ROM, and DVD-ROM drives are removabledisk devices.  Exam‐
                 ples include floppy disk drives, magneto-optical drives, and Compact Flash card read‐
                 ers.

          •  tape

                 A  sequential-access  mass storage device using magnetic tape is a tape device.  Com‐
                 monly used for archival and backup purposes, DAT drives are examples of tape devices.

          •  video

                 A device that produces a real-time digital video signal for input purposes is a video
                 device.   Webcams, digital video cameras, and television tuners are examples of video
                 devices.  Note that still digital cameras with ``movie'' capability are  not  consid‐
                 ered video devices unless they can transmit the live video signal to the host in real
                 time.
