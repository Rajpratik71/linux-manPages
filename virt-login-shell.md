NAME
       virt-login-shell - tool to execute a shell within a container matching the users name

SYNOPSIS
       virt-login-shell [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       The virt-login-shell program is a setuid shell that is used to join an LXC container that matches the user's name.  If the container is not running, virt-login-shell will attempt to start the
       container.  virt-login-shell is not allowed to be run by root.  Normal users will get added to a container that matches their username, if it exists, and they are configured in
       /etc/libvirt/virt-login-shell.conf.

       The basic structure of most virt-login-shell usage is:

         virt-login-shell

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display command line help usage then exit.

       -V, --version
           Display version information then exit.

CONFIG
       By default, virt-login-shell will execute the /bin/sh program for the user.  You can modify this behaviour by defining the shell variable in /etc/libvirt/virt-login-shell.conf.

       eg.  shell = [ "/bin/ksh", "--login"]

       By default no users are allowed to use virt-login-shell, if you want to allow certain users to use virt-login-shell, you need to modify the allowed_users variable in
       /etc/libvirt/virt-login-shell.conf.

       eg. allowed_users = [ "tom", "dick", "harry" ]

EXIT STATUS
       virt-login-shell normally returns the exit status of the command it executed. If the command was killed by a signal, but that signal is not fatal to virt-login-shell, then it returns the signal
       number plus 128.

       Exit status generated by virt-login-shell itself:

       0 An option was used to learn more about this binary.
       125 Generic error before attempting execution of the configured shell; for example, if libvirtd is not running.
       126 The configured shell exists but could not be executed.
       127 The configured shell could not be found.
