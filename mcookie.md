NAME
       mcookie - generate magic cookies for xauth

SYNOPSIS
       mcookie [options]

DESCRIPTION
       mcookie generates a 128-bit random hexadecimal number for use with the X authority system.  Typical usage:

              xauth add :0 . `mcookie`

       The  "random"  number  generated  is  actually  the  MD5  message digest of random information coming from one of the sources /dev/urandom,
       /dev/random, or the libc pseudo-random functions, in this preference order.

OPTIONS
       -f, --file file
              Use this file as an additional source of randomness.  When file is '-', characters are read from standard input.

       -m, --max-size number
              Read from file only this number of bytes.  This option is meant to be used when reading additional randomness from a file or device.

              The number argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB=1024, MiB=1024*1024, and so on for GiB, TiB,  PiB,  EiB,  ZiB
              and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB=1000, MB=1000*1000, and so on for GB, TB,
              PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       -v, --verbose
              Inform where randomness originated, with amount of entropy read from each source.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

BUGS
       It is assumed that none of the randomness sources will block.
