DESCRIPTION
       Duplicity incrementally backs up files and folders into tar-format volumes encrypted with GnuPG
       and places them to a remote (or local) storage backend.  See chapter URL FORMAT for a list of
       all supported backends and how to address them.  Because duplicity uses librsync, incremental
       backups are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last
       backup.  Currently duplicity supports deleted files, full Unix permissions, uid/gid,
       directories, symbolic links, fifos, etc., but not hard links.

       If you are backing up the root directory /, remember to --exclude /proc, or else duplicity will
       probably crash on the weird stuff in there.

EXAMPLES
       Here is an example of a backup, using sftp to back up /home/me to some_dir on the other.host
       machine:

              duplicity /home/me sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir

       If the above is run repeatedly, the first will be a full backup, and subsequent ones will be
       incremental. To force a full backup, use the full action:

              duplicity full /home/me sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir

       or enforcing a full every other time via --full-if-older-than <time> , e.g. a full every month:

              duplicity --full-if-older-than 1M /home/me sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir

       Now suppose we accidentally delete /home/me and want to restore it the way it was at the time
       of last backup:

              duplicity sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir /home/me

       Duplicity enters restore mode because the URL comes before the local directory.  If we wanted
       to restore just the file "Mail/article" in /home/me as it was three days ago into
       /home/me/restored_file:

              duplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore Mail/article sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir
              /home/me/restored_file

       The following command compares the latest backup with the current files:

              duplicity verify sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir /home/me

       Finally, duplicity recognizes several include/exclude options.  For instance, the following
       will backup the root directory, but exclude /mnt, /tmp, and /proc:

              duplicity --exclude /mnt --exclude /tmp --exclude /proc / file:///usr/local/backup

       Note that in this case the destination is the local directory /usr/local/backup.  The following
       will backup only the /home and /etc directories under root:

              duplicity --include /home --include /etc --exclude '**' / file:///usr/local/backup

       Duplicity can also access a repository via ftp.  If a user name is given, the environment
       variable FTP_PASSWORD is read to determine the password:

              FTP_PASSWORD=mypassword duplicity /local/dir ftp://user@other.host/some_dir

ACTIONS
       Duplicity knows action commands, which can be finetuned with options.
       The actions for backup (full,incr) and restoration (restore) can as well be left out as
       duplicity detects in what mode it should switch to by the order of target URL and local folder.
       If the target URL comes before the local folder a restore is in order, is the local folder
       before target URL then this folder is about to be backed up to the target URL.
       If a backup is in order and old signatures can be found duplicity automatically performs an
       incremental backup.

       Note: The following explanations explain some but not all options that can be used in
       connection with that action command.  Consult the OPTIONS section for more detailed
       informations.

       full <folder> <url>
              Perform a full backup. A new backup chain is started even if signatures are available
              for an incremental backup.

       incr <folder> <url>
              If this is requested an incremental backup will be performed.  Duplicity will abort if
              no old signatures can be found.

       verify [--compare-data] [--time <time>] [--file-to-restore <rel_path>] <url> <local_path>
              Verify tests the integrity of the backup archives at the remote location by downloading
              each file and checking both that it can restore the archive and that the restored file
              matches the signature of that file stored in the backup, i.e. compares the archived file
              with its hash value from archival time. Verify does not actually restore and will not
              overwrite any local files. Duplicity will exit with a non-zero error level if any files
              do not match the signature stored in the archive for that file. On verbosity level 4 or
              higher, it will log a message for each file that differs from the stored signature.
              Files must be downloaded to the local machine in order to compare them.  Verify does not
              compare the backed-up version of the file to the current local copy of the files unless
              the --compare-data option is used (see below).
              The --file-to-restore option restricts verify to that file or folder.  The --time option
              allows to select a backup to verify.  The --compare-data option enables data comparison
              (see below).

       collection-status [--file-changed <relpath>]<url>
              Summarize the status of the backup repository by printing the chains and sets found, and
              the number of volumes in each.

       list-current-files [--time <time>] <url>
              Lists the files contained in the most current backup or backup at time.  The information
              will be extracted from the signature files, not the archive data itself. Thus the whole
              archive does not have to be downloaded, but on the other hand if the archive has been
              deleted or corrupted, this command will not detect it.

       restore [--file-to-restore <relpath>] [--time <time>] <url> <target_folder>
              You can restore the full monty or selected folders/files from a specific time.  Use the
              relative path as it is printed by list-current-files.  Usually not needed as duplicity
              enters restore mode when it detects that the URL comes before the local folder.

       remove-older-than <time> [--force] <url>
              Delete all backup sets older than the given time.  Old backup sets will not be deleted
              if backup sets newer than time depend on them.  See the TIME FORMATS section for more
              information.  Note, this action cannot be combined with backup or other actions, such as
              cleanup.  Note also that --force will be needed to delete the files instead of just
              listing them.

       remove-all-but-n-full <count> [--force] <url>
              Delete all backups sets that are older than the count:th last full backup (in other
              words, keep the last count full backups and associated incremental sets).  count must be
              larger than zero. A value of 1 means that only the single most recent backup chain will
              be kept.  Note that --force will be needed to delete the files instead of just listing
              them.

       remove-all-inc-of-but-n-full <count> [--force] <url>
              Delete incremental sets of all backups sets that are older than the count:th last full
              backup (in other words, keep only old full backups and not their increments).  count
              must be larger than zero. A value of 1 means that only the single most recent backup
              chain will be kept intact.  Note that --force will be needed to delete the files instead
              of just listing them.

       cleanup [--force] [--extra-clean] <url>
              Delete the extraneous duplicity files on the given backend.  Non-duplicity files, or
              files in complete data sets will not be deleted.  This should only be necessary after a
              duplicity session fails or is aborted prematurely.  Note that --force will be needed to
              delete the files instead of just listing them.

       replicate [--time time] <source_url> <target_url>
              Replicate backup sets from source to target backend. Files will be (re)-encrypted and
              (re)-compressed depending on normal backend options. Signatures and volumes will not get
              recomputed, thus options like --volsize or --max-blocksize have no effect.  When --time
              time is given, only backup sets older than time will be replicated.

OPTIONS
       --allow-source-mismatch
              Do not abort on attempts to use the same archive dir or remote backend to back up
              different directories. duplicity will tell you if you need this switch.

       --archive-dir path
              The archive directory.  NOTE: This option changed in 0.6.0.  The archive directory is
              now necessary in order to manage persistence for current and future enhancements.  As
              such, this option is now used only to change the location of the archive directory.  The
              archive directory should not be deleted, or duplicity will have to recreate it from the
              remote repository (which may require decrypting the backup contents).

              When backing up or restoring, this option specifies that the local archive directory is
              to be created in path.  If the archive directory is not specified, the default will be
              to create the archive directory in ~/.cache/duplicity/.

              The archive directory can be shared between backups to multiple targets, because a
              subdirectory of the archive dir is used for individual backups (see --name ).

              The combination of archive directory and backup name must be unique in order to separate
              the data of different backups.

              The interaction between the --archive-dir and the --name options allows for four
              possible combinations for the location of the archive dir:

              1.     neither specified (default)
                      ~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url

              2.     --archive-dir=/arch, no --name
                      /arch/hash-of-url

              3.     no --archive-dir, --name=foo
                      ~/.cache/duplicity/foo

              4.     --archive-dir=/arch, --name=foo
                      /arch/foo

       --asynchronous-upload
              (EXPERIMENTAL) Perform file uploads asynchronously in the background, with respect to
              volume creation. This means that duplicity can upload a volume while, at the same time,
              preparing the next volume for upload. The intended end-result is a faster backup,
              because the local CPU and your bandwidth can be more consistently utilized. Use of this
              option implies additional need for disk space in the temporary storage location; rather
              than needing to store only one volume at a time, enough storage space is required to
              store two volumes.

       --backend-retry-delay number
              Specifies the number of seconds that duplicity waits after an error has occured before
              attempting to repeat the operation.

       --cf-backend backend
              Allows the explicit selection of a cloudfiles backend. Defaults to pyrax.  Alternatively
              you might choose cloudfiles.

       --compare-data
              Enable data comparison of regular files on action verify. This conducts a verify as
              described above to verify the integrity of the backup archives, but additionally
              compares restored files to those in target_directory.  Duplicity will not replace any
              files in target_directory. Duplicity will exit with a non-zero error level if the files
              do not correctly verify or if any files from the archive differ from those in
              target_directory. On verbosity level 4 or higher, it will log a message for each file
              that differs from its equivalent in target_directory.

       --copy-links
              Resolve symlinks during backup.  Enabling this will resolve & back up the symlink's
              file/folder data instead of the symlink itself, potentially increasing the size of the
              backup.

       --dry-run
              Calculate what would be done, but do not perform any backend actions

       --encrypt-key key-id
              When backing up, encrypt to the given public key, instead of using symmetric
              (traditional) encryption.  Can be specified multiple times.  The key-id can be given in
              any of the formats supported by GnuPG; see gpg(1), section "HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID"
              for details.

       --encrypt-secret-keyring filename
              This option can only be used with --encrypt-key, and changes the path to the secret
              keyring for the encrypt key to filename This keyring is not used when creating a backup.
              If not specified, the default secret keyring is used which is usually located at
              .gnupg/secring.gpg

       --encrypt-sign-key key-id
              Convenience parameter. Same as --encrypt-key key-id --sign-key key-id.

       --exclude shell_pattern
              Exclude the file or files matched by shell_pattern.  If a directory is matched, then
              files under that directory will also be matched.  See the FILE SELECTION section for
              more information.

       --exclude-device-files
              Exclude all device files.  This can be useful for security/permissions reasons or if
              rdiff-backup is not handling device files correctly.

       --exclude-filelist filename
              Excludes the files listed in filename, with each line of the filelist interpreted
              according to the same rules as --include and --exclude.  See the FILE SELECTION section
              for more information.

       --exclude-if-present filename
              Exclude directories if filename is present. Allows the user to specify folders that they
              do not wish to backup by adding a specified file (e.g. ".nobackup") instead of
              maintaining a comprehensive exclude/include list. This option needs to come before any
              other include or exclude options.

       --exclude-older-than time
              Exclude any files whose modification date is earlier than the specified time.  This can
              be used to produce a partial backup that contains only recently changed files. See the
              TIME FORMATS section for more information.

       --exclude-other-filesystems
              Exclude files on file systems (identified by device number) other than the file system
              the root of the source directory is on.

       --exclude-regexp regexp
              Exclude files matching the given regexp.  Unlike the --exclude option, this option does
              not match files in a directory it matches.  See the FILE SELECTION section for more
              information.

       --extra-clean
              When cleaning up, be more aggressive about saving space.  For example, this may delete
              signature files for old backup chains.

              Caution: Without signature files those old backup chains are unrestorable. Do not use
              --extra-clean unless you know what you're doing.

              See the cleanup argument for more information.

       --file-changed path
              This option may be given in collection-status mode, causing only path status to be
              collect instead of the entire contents of the backup archive.  path should be given
              relative to the root of the directory backed up.

       --file-prefix, --file-prefix-manifest, --file-prefix-archive, --file-prefix-signature
              Adds a prefix to all files, manifest files, archive files, and/or signature files.

              The same set of prefixes must be passed in on backup and restore.

              If both global and type-specific prefixes are set, global prefix will go before type-
              specific prefixes.

              See also A NOTE ON FILENAME PREFIXES

       --file-to-restore path
              This option may be given in restore mode, causing only path to be restored instead of
              the entire contents of the backup archive.  path should be given relative to the root of
              the directory backed up.

       --full-if-older-than time
              Perform a full backup if an incremental backup is requested, but the latest full backup
              in the collection is older than the given time.  See the TIME FORMATS section for more
              information.

       --force
              Proceed even if data loss might result.  Duplicity will let the user know when this
              option is required.

       --ftp-passive
              Use passive (PASV) data connections.  The default is to use passive, but to fallback to
              regular if the passive connection fails or times out.

       --ftp-regular
              Use regular (PORT) data connections.

       --gio  Use the GIO backend and interpret any URLs as GIO would.

       --hidden-encrypt-key key-id
              Same as --encrypt-key, but it hides user's key id from encrypted file. It uses the gpg's
              --hidden-recipient command to obfuscate the owner of the backup. On restore, gpg will
              automatically try all available secret keys in order to decrypt the backup. See gpg(1)
              for more details.

       --ignore-errors
              Try to ignore certain errors if they happen. This option is only intended to allow the
              restoration of a backup in the face of certain problems that would otherwise cause the
              backup to fail. It is not ever recommended to use this option unless you have a
              situation where you are trying to restore from backup and it is failing because of an
              issue which you want duplicity to ignore. Even then, depending on the issue, this option
              may not have an effect.

              Please note that while ignored errors will be logged, there will be no summary at the
              end of the operation to tell you what was ignored, if anything. If this is used for
              emergency restoration of data, it is recommended that you run the backup in such a way
              that you can revisit the backup log (look for lines containing the string
              IGNORED_ERROR).

              If you ever have to use this option for reasons that are not understood or understood
              but not your own responsibility, please contact duplicity maintainers. The need to use
              this option under production circumstances would normally be considered a bug.

       --imap-full-address email_address
              The full email address of the user name when logging into an imap server.  If not
              supplied just the user name part of the email address is used.

       --imap-mailbox option
              Allows you to specify a different mailbox.  The default is "INBOX".  Other languages may
              require a different mailbox than the default.

       --gpg-binary file_path
              Allows you to force duplicity to use file_path as gpg command line binary. Can be an
              absolute or relative file path or a file name.  Default value is 'gpg'. The binary will
              be localized via the PATH environment variable.

       --gpg-options options
              Allows you to pass options to gpg encryption.  The options list should be of the form
              "--opt1 --opt2=parm" where the string is quoted and the only spaces allowed are between
              options.

       --include shell_pattern
              Similar to --exclude but include matched files instead.  Unlike --exclude, this option
              will also match parent directories of matched files (although not necessarily their
              contents).  See the FILE SELECTION section for more information.

       --include-filelist filename
              Like --exclude-filelist, but include the listed files instead.  See the FILE SELECTION
              section for more information.

       --include-regexp regexp
              Include files matching the regular expression regexp.  Only files explicitly matched by
              regexp will be included by this option.  See the FILE SELECTION section for more
              information.

       --log-fd number
              Write specially-formatted versions of output messages to the specified file descriptor.
              The format used is designed to be easily consumable by other programs.

       --log-file filename
              Write specially-formatted versions of output messages to the specified file.  The format
              used is designed to be easily consumable by other programs.

       --max-blocksize number
              determines the number of the blocks examined for changes during the diff process.  For
              files < 1MB the blocksize is a constant of 512.  For files over 1MB the size is given
              by:

              file_blocksize = int((file_len / (2000 * 512)) * 512)
              return min(file_blocksize, globals.max_blocksize)

              where globals.max_blocksize defaults to 2048.  If you specify a larger max_blocksize,
              your difftar files will be larger, but your sigtar files will be smaller.  If you
              specify a smaller max_blocksize, the reverse occurs.  The --max-blocksize option should
              be in multiples of 512.

       --name symbolicname
              Set the symbolic name of the backup being operated on. The intent is to use a separate
              name for each logically distinct backup. For example, someone may use "home_daily_s3"
              for the daily backup of a home directory to Amazon S3. The structure of the name is up
              to the user, it is only important that the names be distinct. The symbolic name is
              currently only used to affect the expansion of --archive-dir , but may be used for
              additional features in the future. Users running more than one distinct backup are
              encouraged to use this option.

              If not specified, the default value is a hash of the backend URL.

       --no-compression
              Do not use GZip to compress files on remote system.

       --no-encryption
              Do not use GnuPG to encrypt files on remote system.

       --no-print-statistics
              By default duplicity will print statistics about the current session after a successful
              backup.  This switch disables that behavior.

       --null-separator
              Use nulls (\0) instead of newlines (\n) as line separators, which may help when dealing
              with filenames containing newlines.  This affects the expected format of the files
              specified by the --{include|exclude}-filelist switches as well as the format of the
              directory statistics file.

       --numeric-owner
              On restore always use the numeric uid/gid from the archive and not the archived
              user/group names, which is the default behaviour.  Recommended for restoring from live
              cds which might have the users with identical names but different uids/gids.

       --num-retries number
              Number of retries to make on errors before giving up.

       --old-filenames
              Use the old filename format (incompatible with Windows/Samba) rather than the new
              filename format.

       --par2-options options
              Verbatim options to pass to par2.

       --par2-redundancy percent
              Adjust the level of redundancy in percent for Par2 recovery files (default 10%).

       --progress
              When selected, duplicity will output the current upload progress and estimated upload
              time. To annotate changes, it will perform a first dry-run before a full or incremental,
              and then runs the real operation estimating the real upload progress.

       --progress-rate number
              Sets the update rate at which duplicity will output the upload progress messages
              (requires --progress option). Default is to prompt the status each 3 seconds.

       --rename <original path> <new path>
              Treats the path orig in the backup as if it were the path new.  Can be passed multiple
              times. An example:

              duplicity restore --rename Documents/metal Music/metal sftp://uid@other.host/some_dir
              /home/me

       --rsync-options options
              Allows you to pass options to the rsync backend.  The options list should be of the form
              "opt1=parm1 opt2=parm2" where the option string is quoted and the only spaces allowed
              are between options. The option string will be passed verbatim to rsync, after any
              internally generated option designating the remote port to use. Here is a possibly
              useful example:

              duplicity --rsync-options="--partial-dir=.rsync-partial" /home/me
              rsync://uid@other.host/some_dir

       --s3-european-buckets
              When using the Amazon S3 backend, create buckets in Europe instead of the default
              (requires --s3-use-new-style ). Also see the EUROPEAN S3 BUCKETS section.

       --s3-unencrypted-connection
              Don't use SSL for connections to S3.

              This may be much faster, at some cost to confidentiality.

              With this option, anyone who can observe traffic between your computer and S3 will be
              able to tell: that you are using Duplicity, the name of the bucket, your AWS Access Key
              ID, the increment dates and the amount of data in each increment.

              This option affects only the connection, not the GPG encryption of the backup increment
              files.  Unless that is disabled, an observer will not be able to see the file names or
              contents.

       --s3-use-new-style
              When operating on Amazon S3 buckets, use new-style subdomain bucket addressing. This is
              now the preferred method to access Amazon S3, but is not backwards compatible if your
              bucket name contains upper-case characters or other characters that are not valid in a
              hostname.

       --s3-use-rrs
              Store volumes using Reduced Redundancy Storage when uploading to Amazon S3.  This will
              lower the cost of storage but also lower the durability of stored volumes to 99.99%
              instead the 99.999999999% durability offered by Standard Storage on S3.

       --s3-use-ia
              Store volumes using Standard - Infrequent Access when uploading to Amazon S3.  This
              storage class has a lower storage cost but a higher per-request cost, and the storage
              cost is calculated against a 30-day storage minimum. According to Amazon, this storage
              is ideal for long-term file storage, backups, and disaster recovery.

       --s3-use-onezone-ia
              Store volumes using One Zone - Infrequent Access when uploading to Amazon S3.  This
              storage is similar to Standard - Infrequent Access, but only stores object data in one
              Availability Zone.

       --s3-use-glacier
              Store volumes using Glacier S3 when uploading to Amazon S3. This storage class has a
              lower cost of storage but a higher per-request cost along with delays of up to 12 hours
              from the time of retrieval request. This storage cost is calculated against a 90-day
              storage minimum. According to Amazon this storage is ideal for data archiving and long-
              term backup offering 99.999999999% durability.  To restore a backup you will have to
              manually migrate all data stored on AWS Glacier back to Standard S3 and wait for AWS to
              complete the migration.  Notice: Duplicity will store the manifest.gpg files from full
              and incremental backups on AWS S3 standard storage to allow quick retrieval for later
              incremental backups, all other data is stored in S3 Glacier.

       --s3-use-multiprocessing
              Allow multipart volumne uploads to S3 through multiprocessing. This option requires
              Python 2.6 and can be used to make uploads to S3 more efficient.  If enabled, files
              duplicity uploads to S3 will be split into chunks and uploaded in parallel. Useful if
              you want to saturate your bandwidth or if large files are failing during upload.

       --s3-use-server-side-encryption
              Allow use of server side encryption in S3

       --s3-multipart-chunk-size
              Chunk size (in MB) used for S3 multipart uploads. Make this smaller than --volsize to
              maximize the use of your bandwidth. For example, a chunk size of 10MB with a volsize of
              30MB will result in 3 chunks per volume upload.

       --s3-multipart-max-procs
              Specify the maximum number of processes to spawn when performing a multipart upload to
              S3. By default, this will choose the number of processors detected on your system (e.g.
              4 for a 4-core system). You can adjust this number as required to ensure you don't
              overload your system while maximizing the use of your bandwidth.

       --s3-multipart-max-timeout
              You can control the maximum time (in seconds) a multipart upload can spend on uploading
              a single chunk to S3. This may be useful if you find your system hanging on multipart
              uploads or if you'd like to control the time variance when uploading to S3 to ensure you
              kill connections to slow S3 endpoints.

       --azure-blob-tier
              Standard storage tier used for backup files (Hot|Cool|Archive).

       --azure-max-single-put-size
              Specify the number of the largest supported upload size where the Azure library makes
              only one put call. If the content size is known and below this value the Azure library
              will only perform one put request to upload one block.  The number is expected to be in
              bytes.

       --azure-max-block-size
              Specify the number for the block size used by the Azure library to upload blobs if it is
              split into multiple blocks.  The maximum block size the service supports is 104857600
              (100MiB) and the default is 4194304 (4MiB)

       --azure-max-connections
              Specify the number of maximum connections to transfer one blob to Azure blob size
              exceeds 64MB. The default values is 2.

       --scp-command command
              (only ssh pexpect backend with --use-scp enabled) The command will be used instead of
              "scp" to send or receive files.  To list and delete existing files, the sftp command is
              used.
              See also A NOTE ON SSH BACKENDS section SSH pexpect backend.

       --sftp-command command
              (only ssh pexpect backend) The command will be used instead of "sftp".
              See also A NOTE ON SSH BACKENDS section SSH pexpect backend.

       --short-filenames
              If this option is specified, the names of the files duplicity writes will be shorter
              (about 30 chars) but less understandable.  This may be useful when backing up to MacOS
              or another OS or FS that doesn't support long filenames.

       --sign-key key-id
              This option can be used when backing up, restoring or verifying.  When backing up, all
              backup files will be signed with keyid key.  When restoring, duplicity will signal an
              error if any remote file is not signed with the given key-id. The key-id can be given in
              any of the formats supported by GnuPG; see gpg(1), section "HOW TO SPECIFY A USER ID"
              for details.  Should be specified only once because currently only one signing key is
              supported. Last entry overrides all other entries.
              See also A NOTE ON SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION AND SIGNING

       --ssh-askpass
              Tells the ssh backend to prompt the user for the remote system password, if it was not
              defined in target url and no FTP_PASSWORD env var is set.  This password is also used
              for passphrase-protected ssh keys.

       --ssh-options options
              Allows you to pass options to the ssh backend.  Can be specified multiple times or as a
              space separated options list.  The options list should be of the form "-oOpt1='parm1'
              -oOpt2='parm2'" where the option string is quoted and the only spaces allowed are
              between options. The option string will be passed verbatim to both scp and sftp, whose
              command line syntax differs slightly hence the options should therefore be given in the
              long option format described in ssh_config(5).

              example of a list:

              duplicity --ssh-options="-oProtocol=2 -oIdentityFile='/my/backup/id'" /home/me
              scp://user@host/some_dir

              example with multiple parameters:

              duplicity --ssh-options="-oProtocol=2" --ssh-options="-oIdentityFile='/my/backup/id'"
              /home/me scp://user@host/some_dir

              NOTE: The ssh paramiko backend currently supports only the -i or -oIdentityFile setting.
              If needed provide more host specific options via ssh_config file.

       --ssl-cacert-file file
              (only webdav & lftp backend) Provide a cacert file for ssl certificate verification.
              See also A NOTE ON SSL CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION.

       --ssl-cacert-path path/to/certs/
              (only webdav backend and python 2.7.9+ OR lftp+webdavs and a recent lftp) Provide a path
              to a folder containing cacert files for ssl certificate verification.
              See also A NOTE ON SSL CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION.

       --ssl-no-check-certificate
              (only webdav & lftp backend) Disable ssl certificate verification.
              See also A NOTE ON SSL CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION.

       --swift-storage-policy
              Use this storage policy when operating on Swift containers.
              See also A NOTE ON SWIFT (OPENSTACK OBJECT STORAGE) ACCESS.

       --metadata-sync-mode mode
              This option defaults to 'partial', but you can set it to 'full'
              Use 'partial' to avoid syncing metadata for backup chains that you are not going to use.
              This saves time when restoring for the first time, and lets you restore an old backup
              that was encrypted with a different passphrase by supplying only the target passphrase.
              Use 'full' to sync metadata for all backup chains on the remote.

       --tempdir directory
              Use this existing directory for duplicity temporary files instead of the system default,
              which is usually the /tmp directory. This option supersedes any environment variable.
              See also ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

       -ttime, --time time, --restore-time time
              Specify the time from which to restore or list files.

       --time-separator char
              Use char as the time separator in filenames instead of colon (":").

       --timeout seconds
              Use seconds as the socket timeout value if duplicity begins to timeout during network
              operations.  The default is 30 seconds.

       --use-agent
              If this option is specified, then --use-agent is passed to the GnuPG encryption process
              and it will try to connect to gpg-agent before it asks for a passphrase for --encrypt-
              key or --sign-key if needed.
              Note: Contrary to previous versions of duplicity, this option will also be honored by
              GnuPG 2 and newer versions. If GnuPG 2 is in use, duplicity passes the option
              --pinentry-mode=loopback to the the gpg process unless --use-agent is specified on the
              duplicity command line. This has the effect that GnuPG 2 uses the agent only if --use-
              agent is given, just like GnuPG 1.

       --verbosity level, -vlevel
              Specify output verbosity level (log level).  Named levels and corresponding values are 0
              Error, 2 Warning, 4 Notice (default), 8 Info, 9 Debug (noisiest).
              level may also be
              a character: e, w, n, i, d
              a word: error, warning, notice, info, debug

              The options -v4, -vn and -vnotice are functionally equivalent, as are the mixed/upper-
              case versions -vN, -vNotice and -vNOTICE.

       --version
              Print duplicity's version and quit.

       --volsize number
              Change the volume size to number MB. Default is 200MB.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       TMPDIR, TEMP, TMP
              In decreasing order of importance, specifies the directory to use for temporary files
              (inherited from Python's tempfile module).  Eventually the option --tempdir supercedes
              any of these.

       FTP_PASSWORD
              Supported by most backends which are password capable. More secure than setting it in
              the backend url (which might be readable in the operating systems process listing to
              other users on the same machine).

       PASSPHRASE
              This passphrase is passed to GnuPG. If this is not set, the user will be prompted for
              the passphrase.

       SIGN_PASSPHRASE
              The passphrase to be used for --sign-key.  If ommitted and sign key is also one of the
              keys to encrypt against PASSPHRASE will be reused instead.  Otherwise, if passphrase is
              needed but not set the user will be prompted for it.

URL FORMAT
       Duplicity uses the URL format (as standard as possible) to define data locations.  The generic
       format for a URL is:

              scheme://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/[/]path

       It is not recommended to expose the password on the command line since it could be revealed to
       anyone with permissions to do process listings, it is permitted however.  Consider setting the
       environment variable FTP_PASSWORD instead, which is used by most, if not all backends,
       regardless of it's name.

       In protocols that support it, the path may be preceded by a single slash, '/path', to represent
       a relative path to the target home directory, or preceded by a double slash, '//path', to
       represent an absolute filesystem path.

       Note:
              Scheme (protocol) access may be provided by more than one backend.  In case the default
              backend is buggy or simply not working in a specific case it might be worth trying an
              alternative implementation.  Alternative backends can be selected by prefixing the
              scheme with the name of the alternative backend e.g.  ncftp+ftp:// and are mentioned
              below the scheme's syntax summary.

       Formats of each of the URL schemes follow:

TIME FORMATS
       duplicity uses time strings in two places.  Firstly, many of the files duplicity creates will
       have the time in their filenames in the w3 datetime format as described in a w3 note at
       http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime.  Basically they look like "2001-07-15T04:09:38-07:00",
       which means what it looks like.  The "-07:00" section means the time zone is 7 hours behind
       UTC.

       Secondly, the -t, --time, and --restore-time options take a time string, which can be given in
       any of several formats:

       1.     the string "now" (refers to the current time)

       2.     a sequences of digits, like "123456890" (indicating the time in seconds after the epoch)

       3.     A string like "2002-01-25T07:00:00+02:00" in datetime format

       4.     An interval, which is a number followed by one of the characters s, m, h, D, W, M, or Y
              (indicating seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years respectively), or a
              series of such pairs.  In this case the string refers to the time that preceded the
              current time by the length of the interval.  For instance, "1h78m" indicates the time
              that was one hour and 78 minutes ago.  The calendar here is unsophisticated: a month is
              always 30 days, a year is always 365 days, and a day is always 86400 seconds.

       5.     A date format of the form YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, or MM-DD-YYYY, which
              indicates midnight on the day in question, relative to the current time zone settings.
              For instance, "2002/3/5", "03-05-2002", and "2002-3-05" all mean March 5th, 2002.

FILE SELECTION
       When duplicity is run, it searches through the given source directory and backs up all the
       files specified by the file selection system.  The file selection system comprises a number of
       file selection conditions, which are set using one of the following command line options:
              --exclude
              --exclude-device-files
              --exclude-filelist
              --exclude-regexp
              --include
              --include-filelist
              --include-regexp
       Each file selection condition either matches or doesn't match a given file.  A given file is
       excluded by the file selection system exactly when the first matching file selection condition
       specifies that the file be excluded; otherwise the file is included.

       For instance,

              duplicity --include /usr --exclude /usr /usr scp://user@host/backup

       is exactly the same as

              duplicity /usr scp://user@host/backup

       because the include and exclude directives match exactly the same files, and the --include
       comes first, giving it precedence.  Similarly,

              duplicity --include /usr/local/bin --exclude /usr/local /usr scp://user@host/backup

       would backup the /usr/local/bin directory (and its contents), but not /usr/local/doc.

       The include, exclude, include-filelist, and exclude-filelist options accept some extended shell
       globbing patterns.  These patterns can contain *, **, ?, and [...]  (character ranges). As in a
       normal shell, * can be expanded to any string of characters not containing "/", ?  expands to
       any character except "/", and [...]  expands to a single character of those characters
       specified (ranges are acceptable).  The new special pattern, **, expands to any string of
       characters whether or not it contains "/".  Furthermore, if the pattern starts with
       "ignorecase:" (case insensitive), then this prefix will be removed and any character in the
       string can be replaced with an upper- or lowercase version of itself.

       Remember that you may need to quote these characters when typing them into a shell, so the
       shell does not interpret the globbing patterns before duplicity sees them.

       The --exclude pattern option matches a file if:

       1.  pattern can be expanded into the file's filename, or
       2.  the file is inside a directory matched by the option.

       Conversely, the --include pattern matches a file if:

       1.  pattern can be expanded into the file's filename, or
       2.  the file is inside a directory matched by the option, or
       3.  the file is a directory which contains a file matched by the option.

       For example,

              --exclude /usr/local

       matches e.g. /usr/local, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape.  It is the same as
       --exclude /usr/local --exclude '/usr/local/**'.

       On the other hand

              --include /usr/local

       specifies that /usr, /usr/local, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape (but not /usr/doc)
       all be backed up. Thus you don't have to worry about including parent directories to make sure
       that included subdirectories have somewhere to go.

       Finally,

              --include ignorecase:'/usr/[a-z0-9]foo/*/**.py'

       would match a file like /usR/5fOO/hello/there/world.py.  If it did match anything, it would
       also match /usr.  If there is no existing file that the given pattern can be expanded into, the
       option will not match /usr alone.

       The --include-filelist, and --exclude-filelist, options also introduce file selection
       conditions.  They direct duplicity to read in a text file (either ASCII or UTF-8), each line of
       which is a file specification, and to include or exclude the matching files.  Lines are
       separated by newlines or nulls, depending on whether the --null-separator switch was given.
       Each line in the filelist will be interpreted as a globbing pattern the way --include and
       --exclude options are interpreted, except that lines starting with "+ " are interpreted as
       include directives, even if found in a filelist referenced by --exclude-filelist.  Similarly,
       lines starting with "- " exclude files even if they are found within an include filelist.

       For example, if file "list.txt" contains the lines:

              /usr/local
              - /usr/local/doc
              /usr/local/bin
              + /var
              - /var

       then --include-filelist list.txt would include /usr, /usr/local, and /usr/local/bin.  It would
       exclude /usr/local/doc, /usr/local/doc/python, etc.  It would also include /usr/local/man, as
       this is included within /user/local.  Finally, it is undefined what happens with /var.  A
       single file list should not contain conflicting file specifications.

       Each line in the filelist will also be interpreted as a globbing pattern the way --include and
       --exclude options are interpreted.  For instance, if the file "list.txt" contains the lines:

              dir/foo
              + dir/bar
              - **

       Then --include-filelist list.txt would be exactly the same as specifying --include dir/foo
       --include dir/bar --exclude ** on the command line.

       Finally, the --include-regexp and --exclude-regexp options allow files to be included and
       excluded if their filenames match a python regular expression.  Regular expression syntax is
       too complicated to explain here, but is covered in Python's library reference.  Unlike the
       --include and --exclude options, the regular expression options don't match files containing or
       contained in matched files.  So for instance

              --include '[0-9]{7}(?!foo)'

       matches any files whose full pathnames contain 7 consecutive digits which aren't followed by
       'foo'.  However, it wouldn't match /home even if /home/ben/1234567 existed.

A NOTE ON AMAZON DRIVE
       1.     The API Keys used for Amazon Drive have not been granted production limits.  Amazon do
              not say what the development limits are and are not replying to to requests to whitelist
              duplicity. A related tool, acd_cli, was demoted to development limits, but continues to
              work fine except for cases of excessive usage. If you experience throttling and similar
              issues with Amazon Drive using this backend, please report them to the mailing list.

       2.     If you previously used the acd+acdcli backend, it is strongly recommended to update to
              the ad backend instead, since it interfaces directly with Amazon Drive. You will need to
              setup the OAuth once again, but can otherwise keep your backups and config.

A NOTE ON AZURE ACCESS
       The Azure backend requires the Microsoft Azure Storage SDK for Python to be installed on the
       system.  See REQUIREMENTS above.

       It uses environment variables for authentification: AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME (required),
       AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY (optional), AZURE_SHARED_ACCESS_SIGNATURE (optional).  One of
       AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY or AZURE_SHARED_ACCESS_SIGNATURE is required.

       A container name must be a valid DNS name, conforming to the following naming rules:

              1.     Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters,
                     numbers, and the dash (-) character.

              2.     Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or
                     number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.

              3.     All letters in a container name must be lowercase.

              4.     Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

A NOTE ON CLOUD FILES ACCESS
       Pyrax is Rackspace's next-generation Cloud management API, including Cloud Files access.  The
       cfpyrax backend requires the pyrax library to be installed on the system.  See REQUIREMENTS
       above.

       Cloudfiles is Rackspace's now deprecated implementation of OpenStack Object Storage protocol.
       Users wishing to use Duplicity with Rackspace Cloud Files should migrate to the new Pyrax
       plugin to ensure support.

       The backend requires python-cloudfiles to be installed on the system.  See REQUIREMENTS above.

       It uses three environment variables for authentification: CLOUDFILES_USERNAME (required),
       CLOUDFILES_APIKEY (required), CLOUDFILES_AUTHURL (optional)

       If CLOUDFILES_AUTHURL is unspecified it will default to the value provided by python-
       cloudfiles, which points to rackspace, hence this value must be set in order to use other cloud
       files providers.

A NOTE ON DROPBOX ACCESS
       1.     First of all Dropbox backend requires valid authentication token. It should be passed
              via DPBX_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.
              To obtain it please create 'Dropbox API' application at:
              https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create
              Then visit app settings and just use 'Generated access token' under OAuth2 section.
              Alternatively you can let duplicity generate access token itself. In such case temporary
              export DPBX_APP_KEY , DPBX_APP_SECRET using values from app settings page and run
              duplicity interactively.
              It will print the URL that you need to open in the browser to obtain OAuth2 token for
              the application. Just follow on-screen instructions and then put generated token to
              DPBX_ACCESS_TOKEN variable. Once done, feel free to unset DPBX_APP_KEY and
              DPBX_APP_SECRET

       2.     "some_dir" must already exist in the Dropbox folder. Depending on access token kind it
              may be:
                     Full Dropbox: path is absolute and starts from 'Dropbox' root folder.
                     App Folder: path is related to application folder. Dropbox client will show it in
                     ~/Dropbox/Apps/<app-name>

       3.     When using Dropbox for storage, be aware that all files, including the ones in the Apps
              folder, will be synced to all connected computers.  You may prefer to use a separate
              Dropbox account specially for the backups, and not connect any computers to that
              account. Alternatively you can configure selective sync on all computers to avoid
              syncing of backup files

A NOTE ON EUROPEAN S3 BUCKETS
       Amazon S3 provides the ability to choose the location of a bucket upon its creation. The
       purpose is to enable the user to choose a location which is better located network
       topologically relative to the user, because it may allow for faster data transfers.

       duplicity will create a new bucket the first time a bucket access is attempted. At this point,
       the bucket will be created in Europe if --s3-european-buckets was given. For reasons having to
       do with how the Amazon S3 service works, this also requires the use of the --s3-use-new-style
       option. This option turns on subdomain based bucket addressing in S3. The details are beyond
       the scope of this man page, but it is important to know that your bucket must not contain upper
       case letters or any other characters that are not valid parts of a hostname. Consequently, for
       reasons of backwards compatibility, use of subdomain based bucket addressing is not enabled by
       default.

       Note that you will need to use --s3-use-new-style for all operations on European buckets; not
       just upon initial creation.

       You only need to use --s3-european-buckets upon initial creation, but you may may use it at all
       times for consistency.

       Further note that when creating a new European bucket, it can take a while before the bucket is
       fully accessible. At the time of this writing it is unclear to what extent this is an expected
       feature of Amazon S3, but in practice you may experience timeouts, socket errors or HTTP errors
       when trying to upload files to your newly created bucket. Give it a few minutes and the bucket
       should function normally.

A NOTE ON FILENAME PREFIXES
       Filename prefixes can be used in multi backend with mirror mode to define affinity rules. They
       can also be used in conjunction with S3 lifecycle rules to transition archive files to Glacier,
       while keeping metadata (signature and manifest files) on S3.

       Duplicity does not require access to archive files except when restoring from backup.

A NOTE ON GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE
       Support for Google Cloud Storage relies on its Interoperable Access, which must be enabled for
       your account.  Once enabled, you can generate Interoperable Storage Access Keys and pass them
       to duplicity via the GS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and GS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
       Alternatively, you can run gsutil config -a to have the Google Cloud Storage utility populate
       the ~/.boto configuration file.

       Enable Interoperable Access: https://code.google.com/apis/console#:storage
       Create Access Keys: https://code.google.com/apis/console#:storage:legacy

A NOTE ON HUBIC
       The hubic backend requires the pyrax library to be installed on the system. See REQUIREMENTS
       above.  You will need to set your credentials for hubiC in a file called ~/.hubic_credentials,
       following this pattern:

              [hubic]
              email = your_email
              password = your_password
              client_id = api_client_id
              client_secret = api_secret_key
              redirect_uri = http://localhost/

A NOTE ON IMAP
       An IMAP account can be used as a target for the upload.  The userid may be specified and the
       password will be requested.

       The from_address_prefix may be specified (and probably should be). The text will be used as the
       "From" address in the IMAP server.  Then on a restore (or list) command the from_address_prefix
       will distinguish between different backups.

A NOTE ON MULTI BACKEND
       The multi backend allows duplicity to combine the storage available in more than one backend
       store (e.g., you can store across a google drive account and a onedrive account to get
       effectively the combined storage available in both).  The URL path specifies a JSON formated
       config file containing a list of the backends it will use. The URL may also specify "query"
       parameters to configure overall behavior.  Each element of the list must have a "url" element,
       and may also contain an optional "description" and an optional "env" list of environment
       variables used to configure that backend.

   Query Parameters
       Query parameters come after the file URL in standard HTTP format for example:
              multi:///path/to/config.json?mode=mirror&onfail=abort
              multi:///path/to/config.json?mode=stripe&onfail=continue
              multi:///path/to/config.json?onfail=abort&mode=stripe
              multi:///path/to/config.json?onfail=abort
       Order does not matter, however unrecognized parameters are considered an error.

       mode=stripe
              This mode (the default) performs round-robin access to the list of backends. In this
              mode, all backends must be reliable as a loss of one means a loss of one of the archive
              files.

       mode=mirror
              This mode accesses backends as a RAID1-store, storing every file in every backend and
              reading files from the first-successful backend.  A loss of any backend should result in
              no failure. Note that backends added later will only get new files and may require a
              manual sync with one of the other operating ones.

       onfail=continue
              This setting (the default) continues all write operations in as best-effort. Any failure
              results in the next backend tried. Failure is reported only when all backends fail a
              given operation with the error result from the last failure.

       onfail=abort
              This setting considers any backend write failure as a terminating condition and reports
              the error.  Data reading and listing operations are independent of this and will try
              with the next backend on failure.

   JSON File Example
              [
               {
                "description": "a comment about the backend"
                "url": "abackend://myuser@domain.com/backup",
                "env": [
                  {
                   "name" : "MYENV",
                   "value" : "xyz"
                  },
                  {
                   "name" : "FOO",
                   "value" : "bar"
                  }
                 ],
                 "prefixes": ["prefix1_", "prefix2_"]
               },
               {
                "url": "file:///path/to/dir"
               }
              ]

A NOTE ON PAR2 WRAPPER BACKEND
       Par2 Wrapper Backend can be used in combination with all other backends to create recovery
       files. Just add par2+ before a regular scheme (e.g.  par2+ftp://user@host/dir or
       par2+s3+http://bucket_name ). This will create par2 recovery files for each archive and upload
       them all to the wrapped backend.

       Before restoring, archives will be verified. Corrupt archives will be repaired on the fly if
       there are enough recovery blocks available.

       Use --par2-redundancy percent to adjust the size (and redundancy) of recovery files in percent.

A NOTE ON PYDRIVE BACKEND
       The pydrive backend requires Python PyDrive package to be installed on the system. See
       REQUIREMENTS above.

       There are two ways to use PyDrive: with a regular account or with a "service account". With a
       service account, a separate account is created, that is only accessible with Google APIs and
       not a web login.  With a regular account, you can store backups in your normal Google Drive.

       To use a service account, go to the Google developers console at
       https://console.developers.google.com. Create a project, and make sure Drive API is enabled for
       the project. Under "APIs and auth", click Create New Client ID, then select Service Account
       with P12 key.

       Download the .p12 key file of the account and convert it to the .pem format:
       openssl pkcs12 -in XXX.p12  -nodes -nocerts > pydriveprivatekey.pem

       The content of .pem file should be passed to GOOGLE_DRIVE_ACCOUNT_KEY environment variable for
       authentification.

       The email address of the account will be used as part of URL. See URL FORMAT above.

       The alternative is to use a regular account. To do this, start as above, but when creating a
       new Client ID, select "Installed application" of type "Other". Create a file with the following
       content, and pass its filename in the GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETTINGS environment variable:

              client_config_backend: settings
              client_config:
                  client_id: <Client ID from developers' console>
                  client_secret: <Client secret from developers' console>
              save_credentials: True
              save_credentials_backend: file
              save_credentials_file: <filename to cache credentials>
              get_refresh_token: True

       In this scenario, the username and host parts of the URL play no role; only the path matters.
       During the first run, you will be prompted to visit an URL in your browser to grant access to
       your drive. Once granted, you will receive a verification code to paste back into Duplicity.
       The credentials are then cached in the file references above for future use.

A NOTE ON SSH BACKENDS
       The ssh backends support sftp and scp/ssh transport protocols.  This is a known user-confusing
       issue as these are fundamentally different.  If you plan to access your backend via one of
       those please inform yourself about the requirements for a server to support sftp or scp/ssh
       access.  To make it even more confusing the user can choose between several ssh backends via a
       scheme prefix: paramiko+ (default), pexpect+, lftp+... .
       paramiko & pexpect support --use-scp, --ssh-askpass and --ssh-options.  Only the pexpect
       backend allows to define --scp-command and --sftp-command.

       SSH paramiko backend (default) is a complete reimplementation of ssh protocols natively in
       python. Advantages are speed and maintainability. Minor disadvantage is that extra packages are
       needed as listed in REQUIREMENTS above. In sftp (default) mode all operations are done via the
       according sftp commands. In scp mode ( --use-scp ) though scp access is used for put/get
       operations but listing is done via ssh remote shell.

       SSH pexpect backend is the legacy ssh backend using the command line ssh binaries via pexpect.
       Older versions used scp for get and put operations and sftp for list and delete operations.
       The current version uses sftp for all four supported operations, unless the --use-scp option is
       used to revert to old behavior.

       SSH lftp backend is simply there because lftp can interact with the ssh cmd line binaries.  It
       is meant as a last resort in case the above options fail for some reason.

       Why use sftp instead of scp?  The change to sftp was made in order to allow the remote system
       to chroot the backup, thus providing better security and because it does not suffer from shell
       quoting issues like scp.  Scp also does not support any kind of file listing, so sftp or ssh
       access will always be needed in addition for this backend mode to work properly. Sftp does not
       have these limitations but needs an sftp service running on the backend server, which is
       sometimes not an option.

A NOTE ON SSL CERTIFICATE VERIFICATION
       Certificate verification as implemented right now [02.2016] only in the webdav and lftp
       backends. older pythons 2.7.8- and older lftp binaries need a file based database of
       certification authority certificates (cacert file).
       Newer python 2.7.9+ and recent lftp versions however support the system default certificates
       (usually in /etc/ssl/certs) and also giving an alternative ca cert folder via --ssl-cacert-
       path.

       The cacert file has to be a PEM formatted text file as currently provided by the CURL project.
       See

              http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

       After creating/retrieving a valid cacert file you should copy it to either

              ~/.duplicity/cacert.pem
              ~/duplicity_cacert.pem
              /etc/duplicity/cacert.pem

       Duplicity searches it there in the same order and will fail if it can't find it.  You can
       however specify the option --ssl-cacert-file <file> to point duplicity to a copy in a different
       location.

       Finally there is the --ssl-no-check-certificate option to disable certificate verification
       alltogether, in case some ssl library is missing or verification is not wanted. Use it with
       care, as even with self signed servers manually providing the private ca certificate is
       definitely the safer option.

A NOTE ON SWIFT (OPENSTACK OBJECT STORAGE) ACCESS
       Swift is the OpenStack Object Storage service.
       The backend requires python-switclient to be installed on the system.  python-keystoneclient is
       also needed to use OpenStack's Keystone Identity service.  See REQUIREMENTS above.

       It uses following environment variables for authentification: SWIFT_USERNAME (required),
       SWIFT_PASSWORD (required), SWIFT_AUTHURL (required), SWIFT_USERID (required, only for IBM
       Bluemix ObjectStorage), SWIFT_TENANTID (required, only for IBM Bluemix ObjectStorage),
       SWIFT_REGIONNAME (required, only for IBM Bluemix ObjectStorage), SWIFT_TENANTNAME (optional,
       the tenant can be included in the username)

       If the user was previously authenticated, the following environment variables can be used
       instead: SWIFT_PREAUTHURL (required), SWIFT_PREAUTHTOKEN (required)

       If SWIFT_AUTHVERSION is unspecified, it will default to version 1.

A NOTE ON PCA ACCESS
       PCA is a long-term data archival solution by OVH. It runs a slightly modified version of
       Openstack Swift introducing latency in the data retrieval process.  It is a good pick for a
       multi backend configuration where receiving volumes while an other backend is used to store
       manifests and signatures.

       The backend requires python-switclient to be installed on the system.  python-keystoneclient is
       also needed to interact with OpenStack's Keystone Identity service.  See REQUIREMENTS above.

       It uses following environment variables for authentification: PCA_USERNAME (required),
       PCA_PASSWORD (required), PCA_AUTHURL (required), PCA_USERID (optional), PCA_TENANTID (optional,
       but either the tenant name or tenant id must be supplied) PCA_REGIONNAME (optional),
       PCA_TENANTNAME (optional, but either the tenant name or tenant id must be supplied)

       If the user was previously authenticated, the following environment variables can be used
       instead: PCA_PREAUTHURL (required), PCA_PREAUTHTOKEN (required)

       If PCA_AUTHVERSION is unspecified, it will default to version 2.

A NOTE ON MEDIAFIRE BACKEND
       This backend requires mediafire python library to be installed on the system. See REQUIREMENTS.

       Use URL escaping for username (and password, if provided via command line):

              mf://duplicity%40example.com@mediafire.com/some_folder

       The destination folder will be created for you if it does not exist.

A NOTE ON SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION AND SIGNING
       Signing and symmetrically encrypt at the same time with the gpg binary on the command line, as
       used within duplicity, is a specifically challenging issue.  Tests showed that the following
       combinations proved working.

       1. Setup gpg-agent properly. Use the option --use-agent and enter both passphrases (symmetric
       and sign key) in the gpg-agent's dialog.

       2. Use a PASSPHRASE for symmetric encryption of your choice but the signing key has an empty
       passphrase.

       3. The used PASSPHRASE for symmetric encryption and the passphrase of the signing key are
       identical.

KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS
       Hard links currently unsupported (they will be treated as non-linked regular files).

       Bad signatures will be treated as empty instead of logging appropriate error message.

OPERATION AND DATA FORMATS
       This section describes duplicity's basic operation and the format of its data files.  It should
       not be necessary to read this section to use duplicity.

       The files used by duplicity to store backup data are tarfiles in GNU tar format.  They can be
       produced independently by rdiffdir(1).  For incremental backups, new files are saved normally
       in the tarfile.  But when a file changes, instead of storing a complete copy of the file, only
       a diff is stored, as generated by rdiff(1).  If a file is deleted, a 0 length file is stored in
       the tar.  It is possible to restore a duplicity archive "manually" by using tar and then cp,
       rdiff, and rm as necessary.  These duplicity archives have the extension difftar.

       Both full and incremental backup sets have the same format.  In effect, a full backup set is an
       incremental one generated from an empty signature (see below).  The files in full backup sets
       will start with duplicity-full while the incremental sets start with duplicity-inc.  When
       restoring, duplicity applies patches in order, so deleting, for instance, a full backup set may
       make related incremental backup sets unusable.

       In order to determine which files have been deleted, and to calculate diffs for changed files,
       duplicity needs to process information about previous sessions.  It stores this information in
       the form of tarfiles where each entry's data contains the signature (as produced by rdiff) of
       the file instead of the file's contents.  These signature sets have the extension sigtar.

       Signature files are not required to restore a backup set, but without an up-to-date signature,
       duplicity cannot append an incremental backup to an existing archive.

       To save bandwidth, duplicity generates full signature sets and incremental signature sets.  A
       full signature set is generated for each full backup, and an incremental one for each
       incremental backup.  These start with duplicity-full-signatures and duplicity-new-signatures
       respectively. These signatures will be stored both locally and remotely.  The remote signatures
       will be encrypted if encryption is enabled.  The local signatures will not be encrypted and
       stored in the archive dir (see --archive-dir ).

REQUIREMENTS
       Duplicity requires a POSIX-like operating system with a python interpreter version 2.6+
       installed.  It is best used under GNU/Linux.
