SETKEYCODES(8)                 Keyboard Support                SETKEYCODES(8)

NAME
       setkeycodes - load kernel scancode-to-keycode mapping table entries

SYNOPSIS
       setkeycodes scancode keycode ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  setkeycodes  command reads its arguments two at a time, each pair
       of arguments consisting of a scancode (given  in  hexadecimal)  and  a
       keycode  (given  in  decimal). For each such pair, it tells the kernel
       keyboard driver to map the specified scancode to  the  specified  key‐
       code.

       This  command  is  useful  only  for people with slightly unusual key‐
       boards, that have a few keys which produce scancodes that  the  kernel
       does not recognize.

THEORY
       The  usual  PC  keyboard  produces  a series of scancodes for each key
       press and key  release.  (Scancodes  are  shown  by  showkey  -s,  see
       showkey(1).)  The kernel parses this stream of scancodes, and converts
       it to a stream of keycodes (key press/release events).  (Keycodes  are
       shown  by  showkey.)  Apart from a few scancodes with special meaning,
       and apart from the sequence produced by the Pause key, and apart  from
       shiftstate  related scancodes, and apart from the key up/down bit, the
       stream of scancodes consists of unescaped scancodes xx  (7  bits)  and
       escaped  scancodes  e0  xx (8+7 bits).  To these scancodes or scancode
       pairs, a corresponding keycode can be assigned (in the  range  1-127).
       For  example, if you have a Macro key that produces e0 6f according to
       showkey(1), the command
              setkeycodes e06f 112
       will assign the keycode 112 to it, and then loadkeys(1) can be used to
       define the function of this key.

       Some  older kernels might hardwire a low scancode range to the equiva‐
       lent keycodes; setkeycodes will fail when you try to remap these.

2.6 KERNELS
       In 2.6 kernels key codes lie in the range  1-255,  instead  of  1-127.
       (It might be best to confine oneself to the range 1-239.)

       In  2.6  kernels  raw  mode, or scancode mode, is not very raw at all.
       The code returned by showkey -s will change after use of  setkeycodes.
       A kernel bug. See also showkey(1).

OPTIONS
       None.

BUGS
       The  keycodes  of  X  have nothing to do with those of Linux.  Unusual
       keys can be made visible under Linux, but not under X.
