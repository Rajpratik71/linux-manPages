NAME
       aa-enabled - test whether AppArmor is enabled

SYNOPSIS
       aa-enabled [options]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-enabled is used to determine if AppArmor is enabled.

OPTIONS
       aa-enabled accepts the following arguments:

       -h, --help
           Display a brief usage guide.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not output anything to stdout. This option is intended to be used by scripts that simply want to use the exit code to determine if AppArmor is enabled.

EXIT STATUS
       Upon exiting, aa-enabled will set its exit status to the following values:

       0:  if AppArmor is enabled.

       1:  if AppArmor is not enabled/loaded.

       2:  intentionally not used as an aa-enabled exit status.

       3:  if the AppArmor control files aren't available under /sys/kernel/security/.

       4:  if aa-enabled doesn't have enough privileges to read the apparmor control files.

       64: if any unexpected error or condition is encountered.
