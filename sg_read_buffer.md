SG_READ_BUFFER(8)                                                                                 SG3_UTILS                                                                                 SG_READ_BUFFER(8)



NAME
       sg_read_buffer - send SCSI READ BUFFER command

SYNOPSIS
       sg_read_buffer [--help] [--hex] [--id=ID] [--length=LEN] [--mode=MO] [--offset=OFF] [--raw] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  SCSI READ BUFFER command to the DEVICE, and if there is a response either decodes it, prints it in hexadecimal or sends it in binary to stdout. If a response is received for a "descriptor"
       mode then, in the absence of --hex and --raw, it is decoded. Response for non-descriptor modes are output in hexadecimal unless the --raw option is given.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit. If used multiple times also prints the mode names and their acronyms.

       -H, --hex
              output the response in hexadecimal. When given twice the response is output in hex with the corresponding representation in ASCII to the right of each line.

       -i, --id=ID
              this option sets the buffer id field in the cdb. ID is a value between 0 (default) and 255 inclusive.

       -l, --length=LEN
              where LEN is the length, in bytes, that is placed in the "allocation length" field in the cdb. The default value is 4 (bytes). The device may respond with less bytes.

       -m, --mode=MO
              this option sets the mode field in the cdb. MO is a value between 0 (default) and 31 inclusive. Alternatively an abbreviation can be given.  To list the available mode  abbreviations  use  an
              invalid one (e.g. '--mode=xxx'). As an example, to fetch the read buffer descriptor give '--mode=desc' .

       -o, --offset=OFF
              this option sets the buffer offset field in the cdb. OFF is a value between 0 (default) and 2**24-1 . It is a byte offset.

       -r, --raw
              if a response is received then it is sent in binary to stdout.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

NOTES
       All numbers given with options are assumed to be decimal.  Alternatively numerical values can be given in hexadecimal preceded by either "0x" or "0X" (or has a trailing "h" or "H").

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_read_buffer is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
