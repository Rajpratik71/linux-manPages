PCCARDCTL(8)               System Manager's Manual               PCCARDCTL(8)

NAME
       pccardctl - PCMCIA card control utility
       lspcmcia - display extended PCMCIA debugging information

SYNOPSIS
       pccardctl [-V] [-v ...] command [socket]
       lspcmcia [-V] [-v ...] [socket]

DESCRIPTION
       pccardctl  is used to monitor and control the state of PCMCIA sockets.
       If a socket number is specified, the command will be applied  to  just
       one socket; otherwise, all sockets will be affected.

       If  pccardctl  is executed by root, all commands are available.  If it
       is executed by an unpriviledged user, only the informational  commands
       are accessible.

       lspcmcia is an alias for pccardctl ls, provided for convenience.

COMMANDS
       status
           Display the current socket status flags.

       config
           Display the socket configuration, including power settings, inter‐
           rupt and I/O window settings, and configuration registers.   --not
           yet implemented

       ident
           Display card identification information, including product identi‐
           fication strings, manufacturer ID codes, and  function  ID  codes.
           Not yet implemented for cardbus cards. Use lspci instead.

       info
           Much  like  the  ident  command,  but its output is formatted as a
           series of Bourne-stype  shell  variable  definitions  for  use  in
           scripts.  Not yet implemented for cardbus cards.

       ls  Display  extended  debugging  information about the PCMCIA sockets
           and devices present in the system.

       suspend
           Shut down and then disable power for a socket.

       resume
           Restore power to a socket, and re-configure for use.

       eject
           Notify all client drivers that this card will be ejected, then cut
           power to the socket.

       insert
           Notify all client drivers that this card has just been inserted.

OPTIONS
       -V     Show version information and exit.

       -v     Increase  the  verbosity of the ls command.  Giving this option
              twice increases verbosity further.
