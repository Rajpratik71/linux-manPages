NAME
       virt-tar-in - Unpack a tarball into a virtual machine disk image.

SYNOPSIS
        virt-tar-in -a disk.img data.tar /destination

        virt-tar-in -d domain data.tar /destination

        zcat data.tar.gz | virt-tar-in -d domain - /destination

WARNING
       Using "virt-tar-in" on live virtual machines, or concurrently with other disk editing tools, can be dangerous, potentially causing disk corruption.  The virtual machine must be shut down before
       you use this command, and disk images must not be edited concurrently.

DESCRIPTION
       "virt-tar-in" unpacks an uncompressed tarball into a virtual machine disk image or named libvirt domain.

       The first parameter is the tar file.  Use "-" to read the tar file from standard input.  The second parameter is the absolute target directory to unpack into.

EXAMPLES
       Upload a home directory to a guest:

        virt-tar-in -d MyGuest homes.tar /home

JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH
       This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the guestfish(1) "tar-in" command.  For anything more complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish directly.

OPTIONS
       Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full list of options.
