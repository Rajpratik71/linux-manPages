FDUPES(1)                                                     General Commands Manual                                                    FDUPES(1)

NAME
       fdupes - finds duplicate files in a given set of directories

SYNOPSIS
       fdupes [ options ] DIRECTORY ...

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  the  given  path for duplicate files. Such files are found by comparing file sizes and MD5 signatures, followed by a byte-by-byte
       comparison.

OPTIONS
       -r --recurse
              for every directory given follow subdirectories encountered within

       -R --recurse:
              for each directory given after this option follow subdirectories encountered within (note the ':' at the  end  of  option;  see  the
              Examples section below for further explanation)

       -s --symlinks
              follow symlinked directories

       -H --hardlinks
              normally, when two or more files point to the same disk area they are treated as non-duplicates; this option will change this behav‚Äê
              ior

       -n --noempty
              exclude zero-length files from consideration

       -f --omitfirst
              omit the first file in each set of matches

       -A --nohidden
              exclude hidden files from consideration

       -1 --sameline
              list each set of matches on a single line

       -S --size
              show size of duplicate files

       -m --summarize
              summarize duplicate files information

       -q --quiet
              hide progress indicator

       -d --delete
              prompt user for files to preserve, deleting all others (see CAVEATS below)

       -N --noprompt
              when used together with --delete, preserve the first file in each set of duplicates and delete the others without prompting the user

       -I --immediate
              delete duplicates as they are encountered, without grouping into sets; implies --noprompt

       -p --permissions
              don't consider files with different owner/group or permission bits as duplicates

       -o --order=WORD
              order files according to WORD: time - sort by mtime, name - sort by filename

       -i --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -v --version
              display fdupes version

       -h --help
              displays help

SEE ALSO
       md5sum(1)

NOTES
       Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed together in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The groups are
       then separated from each other by blank lines.

       When -1 or --sameline is specified, spaces and backslash characters  (\) appearing in a filename are preceded by a backslash character.

EXAMPLES
       fdupes a --recurse: b
              will follow subdirectories under b, but not those under a.

       fdupes a --recurse b
              will follow subdirectories under both a and b.

CAVEATS
       If  fdupes  returns  with  an error message such as fdupes: error invoking md5sum it means the program has been compiled to use an external
       program to calculate MD5 signatures (otherwise, fdupes uses internal routines for this purpose), and an error has occurred while attempting
       to execute it. If this is the case, the specified program should be properly installed prior to running fdupes.

       When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against accidental data loss.

       When used together with options -s or --symlink, a user could accidentally preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to.

       Furthermore, when specifying a particular directory more than once, all files within that directory will be listed as their own duplicates,
       leading to data loss should a user preserve a file without its "duplicate" (the file itself!).
