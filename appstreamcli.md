NAME
       appstreamcli - Handle AppStream metadata and the AppStream index

SYNOPSIS
       appstreamcli [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the appstreamcli command.

       appstreamcli is a small helper tool to work with AppStream metadata and access the AppStream component index from the command-line. The AppStream component index contains a list of all available
       software components for your distribution, matched to their package names. It is generated using AppStream XML or Debian DEP-11 data, which is provided by your distributor.

       For more information about the AppStream project and the other components which are part of it, take a look at the AppStream pages at Freedesktop.org[1].

OPTIONS
       status
           Display various information about the installed metadata and the metadata cache.

       get ID
           Get a component by it's identifier.

       s, search TERM
           Search the AppStream component database for a given search term.

       what-provides TYPE TERM
           Return components which provide a given item. An item type can be specified using the TYPE parameter, a value to search for has to be supplied using the TERM parameter.

           Examples:

           Get components which handle the "text/xml" mimetype.

           appstreamcli what-provides mimetype "text/xml"

           Get component which provides the "libfoo.so.2" library.

           appstreamcli what-provides lib libfoo.so.2

       refresh, refresh-index
           Trigger a database refresh, if necessary. In case you want to force the database to be rebuilt, supply the --force flag.

           This command must be executed with root permission.

       dump ID
           Dump the XML description of a component with the given ID.

       validate FILES
           Validate AppStream XML metadata for compliance with the specification.

           Both XML metadata types, upstream and distro XML, are handled. The filetype which should be validated is determined automatically.

           The --pedantic flag triggers a more pedantic validation of the file, including minor and style issues in the report.

       validate-tree DIRECTORY
           Validate AppStream XML metadata found in a file-tree.

           This performs a standard validation of all found metadata, but also checks for additional errors, like the presence of .desktop files and validity of other additional metadata.

       install ID
           Install a software component by its ID.

           This resolves the AppStream component ID to the package name which provides it and then calls the distribution's package manager to install the software.

           This feature is experimental.

       put FILE
           Install a metadata file into the right directory on the current machine.

       --details
           Print out more information about a found component.

       --no-color
           Don't print colored output.

       --version
           Display the version number of appstreamcli
