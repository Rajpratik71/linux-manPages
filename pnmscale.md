NAME
       pnmscale - replaced by pamscale



DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmscale  was  obsoleted  by  pamscale(1) , introduced with Netpbm 10.20 (January 2004).  pamscale is backward compatible with pnmscale, plus adds many additional functions, including the ability to
       process PAM images.

       pnmscale remained in the Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009) because of hopes that it had fewer bugs than pamscale because of its age.  But now it would just be clutter.

       In Netpbm before 10.20, use the manual for pamscale with pnmscale.  Features that are in pamscale but not pnmscale are indicated by statements that they didn't exist before 10.20.
