NAME
       ntfslabel - display/change the label on an ntfs file system

SYNOPSIS
       ntfslabel [options] device [new-label]

DESCRIPTION
       ntfslabel  will  display  or  change the file system label on the ntfs
       file system located on device.  It can also change the  serial  number
       of the device.

       If  the  optional  argument new-label is not present, and no option is
       present, ntfslabel will simply display the current file system label.

       If the optional argument new-label is present, then ntfslabel will set
       the file system label to be new-label.  NTFS file system labels can be
       at most 128 Unicode characters long; if new-label is longer  than  128
       Unicode  characters,  ntfslabel  will  truncate it and print a warning
       message.

       It is also possible to set the file system label using the  -L  option
       of mkntfs(8) during creation of the file system.

OPTIONS
       Below  is a summary of all the options that ntfslabel accepts.  Nearly
       all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded  by
       -  and  the  long  name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options,
       that don't take an argument, can be combined into  a  single  command,
       e.g.   -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbrevi‐
       ated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not  working
              with a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       --new-serial[=ssssssssssssssss], or

       --new-half-serial[=ssssssss]
              Set  a  new  serial  number  to the device, either the argument
              value, or a random one if no argument is given. The serial num‐
              ber is a 64 bit number, represented as a sixteen-digit hexadec‐
              imal number, used to identify the device  during  the  mounting
              process.  As  a  consequence,  two devices with the same serial
              number cannot be mounted at the same time on the same computer.
              This  is  not  the  volume UUID used by Windows to locate files
              which have been moved to another volume.

              The option --new-half-serial only changes the upper part of the
              serial  number, keeping the lower part which is used by Windows
              unchanged.  In this case the optional  argument  is  an  eight-
              digit hexadecimal number.

       -n, --no-action
              Don't actually write to disk.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount of output to a minimum.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase  the amount of output that ntfslabel prints. The label
              and the serial number are displayed.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license for ntfslabel.
