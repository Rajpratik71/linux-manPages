lxc-monitor(1)                                            lxc-monitor(1)

NAME
       lxc-monitor - monitor the container state

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-monitor [-n name] [-Q name]

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-monitor  monitors  the state of containers. The name argument
       may be used to specify which containers to monitor. It is a regu‐
       lar expression, conforming with posix2, so it is possible to mon‐
       itor all the containers, several of them  or  just  one.  If  not
       specified,  name will default to '.*' which will monitor all con‐
       tainers in lxcpath.

       The -P, --lxcpath=PATH option may be specified multiple times  to
       monitor  more than one container path. Note however that contain‐
       ers with the same name in multiple paths will  be  indistinguish‐
       able in the output.

OPTIONS
       -Q, --quit
              Ask the lxc-monitord daemon on each given lxcpath to quit.
              After receiving this command, lxc-monitord will exit imme‐
              diately  as  soon  as it has no clients instead of waiting
              the normal 30 seconds for new clients. This is  useful  if
              you need to unmount the filesystem lxcpath is on.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to most of lxc commands.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       --usage
              Give the usage message

       -q, --quiet
              mute on

       -P, --lxcpath=PATH
              Use   an   alternate   container   path.  The  default  is
              /var/lib/lxc.

       -o, --logfile=FILE
              Output to an alternate log FILE. The default is no log.

       -l, --logpriority=LEVEL
              Set log priority to LEVEL. The default log priority is ER‐
              ROR.  Possible  values are : FATAL, CRIT, WARN, ERROR, NO‐
              TICE, INFO, DEBUG.

              Note that this option  is  setting  the  priority  of  the
              events  log  in the alternate log file. It do not have ef‐
              fect on the ERROR events log on stderr.

       -n, --name=NAME

              format is an alphanumeric string.

       --rcfile=FILE
              Specify  the  configuration file to configure the virtual‐
              ization and isolation functionalities for the container.

              This configuration file if present will be  used  even  if
              there  is already a configuration file present in the pre‐
              viously created container (via lxc-create).

       --version
              Show the version number.

EXAMPLES
       lxc-monitor -n foo
              will monitor the different states for container foo.

       lxc-monitor -n 'foo|bar'
              will monitor the different states for  container  foo  and
              bar.

       lxc-monitor -n '[fb].*'
              will  monitor  the different states for container with the
              name beginning with letter 'f' or 'b'.

       lxc-monitor -n '.*'
              will monitor the different states for all containers.

DIAGNOSTIC
