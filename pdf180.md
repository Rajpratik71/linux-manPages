NAME
       pdf180 - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdf180 [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf180 rotates the pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through 180 degrees.

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is used, in which case they are processed separately.

       pdf180  operates  on  one  or  more  PDF  files,  and  (either  with  the '--batch' option or with '--outfile DIR' where 'DIR' is a directory) the resulting files have the suffix
       '-rotated180' applied to their names by default.  To change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdf180 --suffix 'upturned' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myfile1-upturned.pdf' and 'myfile2-upturned.pdf'.

       pdf180 is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which is a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex  with  the  pdf‚Äê
       pages package is required.

       pdf180 is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
