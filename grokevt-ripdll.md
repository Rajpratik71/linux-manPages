NAME
       grokevt-ripdll - A tool for extracting message resources from a PE-formatted file.

SYNOPSIS
       grokevt-ripdll  input-dll  output-db .SH DESCRIPTION grokevt-ripdll parses a PE-formatted file (modern .exe and .dll files are examples PE-
       formatted files) and extracts all message resources. These resources are then stored in a Berkeley-style database file, which maps relative
       virtual addresses (RVAs) to the message resources themselves. These RVAs are what can be found in a windows event log file (.evt extension)
       to reference the proper message resource.  This utility is not intended to be used directly by end-users.  It is used by grokevt-builddb(1)
       to extract resources from all DLL/EXEs referenced in the registry.

ARGUMENTS
       input-dll
              This  is the PE formatted file to extract resources from. (It doesn't need to have a .dll extension, but it is most commonly used on
              DLLs.)

       output-db
              The database file to store the RVA->message mapping in. If this file already exists, it will be overwritten.  To extract the entries
              stored in this database, see grokevt-dumpmsgs(1).

BUGS
       Probably a few. This script has not been extensively tested with some guest platforms or with non-english systems.

       The  documentation  used  as a reference for PE formatted files was not complete or not completely accurate in places. Much guess-and-check
       took place.
