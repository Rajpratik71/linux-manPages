NAME
       nano - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone

SYNOPSIS
       nano [options] [[+line[,column]] file]...

DESCRIPTION
       nano  is  a  small and friendly editor.  It copies the look and feel of Pico, but is free software, and implements several features that Pico lacks, such as: opening multiple files, scrolling
       per line, undo/redo, syntax coloring, line numbering, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.

       When giving a filename on the command line, the cursor can be put on a specific line by adding the line number with a plus sign (+) before the filename, and  even  in  a  specific  column  by
       adding it with a comma.

       As a special case: if instead of a filename a dash (-) is given, nano will read data from standard input.

EDITING
       Entering  text and moving around in a file is straightforward: typing the letters and using the normal cursor movement keys.  Commands are entered by using the Control (^) and the Alt or Meta
       (M-) keys.  Typing ^K deletes the current line and puts it in the cutbuffer.  Consecutive ^Ks will put all deleted lines together in the cutbuffer.  Any cursor movement or executing any other
       command will cause the next ^K to overwrite the cutbuffer.  A ^U will paste the current contents of the cutbuffer at the current cursor position.

       When  a  more  precise piece of text needs to be cut or copied, one can mark its start with ^6, move the cursor to its end (the marked text will be highlighted), and then use ^K to cut it, or
       M-6 to copy it to the cutbuffer.  One can also save the marked text to a file with ^O, or spell check it with ^T.

       Since nano-2.7.0, text can also be selected by holding Shift and moving the cursor with the arrow keys.  Holding down the Alt key too will increase the stride.

       The two lines at the bottom of the screen show some important commands; the built-in help (^G) lists all the available ones.  The default key bindings can be changed via a nanorc file --  see
       nanorc(5).

OPTIONS
       -A, --smarthome
              Make  the  Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor will jump to that beginning (either forwards or
              backwards).  If the cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true beginning of the line.

       -B, --backup
              When saving a file, back up the previous version of it, using the current filename suffixed with a tilde (~).

       -C directory, --backupdir=directory
              Make and keep not just one backup file, but make and keep a uniquely numbered one every time a file is saved -- when backups are enabled (-B).  The uniquely numbered files  are  stored
              in the specified directory.

       -D, --boldtext
              Use bold text instead of reverse video text.

       -E, --tabstospaces
              Convert typed tabs to spaces.

       -F, --multibuffer
              Read a file into a new buffer by default.

       -G, --locking
              Use vim-style file locking when editing files.

       -H, --historylog
              Save the last hundred search strings and replacement strings and executed commands, so they can be easily reused in later sessions.

       -I, --ignorercfiles
              Don't look at the system's nanorc nor at the user's nanorc.

       -K, --rebindkeypad
              Interpret the numeric keypad keys so that they all work properly.  You should only need to use this option if they don't, as mouse support won't work properly with this option enabled.

       -L, --nonewlines
              Don't add newlines to the ends of files.

       -M, --trimblanks
              Snip trailing whitespace from the wrapped line when automatic hard-wrapping occurs or when text is justified.

       -N, --noconvert
              Disable automatic conversion of files from DOS/Mac format.

       -O, --morespace
              Use the blank line below the title bar as extra editing space.

       -P, --positionlog
              For  the  200 most recent files, log the last position of the cursor, and place it at that position again upon reopening such a file.  (The old form of this option, --poslog, is depre‐
              cated.)

       -Q "characters", --quotestr="characters"
              Set the quoting string for justifying.  The default is "^([ \t]*[#:>\|}])+" if extended regular expression support is available, or "> " otherwise.  Note that \t stands for a Tab.

       -R, --restricted
              Restricted mode: don't read or write to any file not specified on the command line; don't read any nanorc files nor history files; don't allow  suspending  nor  spell  checking;  don't
              allow  a  file  to be appended to, prepended to, or saved under a different name if it already has one; and don't use backup files.  This restricted mode is also accessible by invoking
              nano with any name beginning with 'r' (e.g. "rnano").

       -S, --smooth
              Use smooth scrolling: text will scroll line-by-line, instead of the usual chunk-by-chunk behavior.

       -T number, --tabsize=number
              Set the size (width) of a tab to number columns.  The value of number must be greater than 0.  The default value is 8.

       -U, --quickblank
              Do quick status-bar blanking: status-bar messages will disappear after 1 keystroke instead of 25.  Note that option -c (--constantshow) overrides this.

       -V, --version
              Show the current version number and exit.

       -W, --wordbounds
              Detect word boundaries differently by treating punctuation characters as part of a word.

       -X "characters", --wordchars="characters"
              Specify which other characters (besides the normal alphanumeric ones) should be considered as part of a word.  This overrides option -W (--wordbounds).

       -Y name, --syntax=name
              Specify the name of the syntax highlighting to use from among the ones defined in the nanorc files.

       -a, --atblanks
              When doing soft line wrapping, wrap lines at whitespace instead of always at the edge of the screen.

       -c, --constantshow
              Constantly show the cursor position on the status bar.  Note that this overrides option -U (--quickblank).

       -d, --rebinddelete
              Interpret the Delete key differently so that both Backspace and Delete work properly.  You should only need to use this option if Backspace acts like Delete on your system.

       -g, --showcursor
              Make the cursor visible in the file browser, putting it on the highlighted item.  Useful for braille users.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the available command-line options and exit.

       -i, --autoindent
              Indent new lines to the previous line's indentation.  Useful when editing source code.

       -k, --cutfromcursor
              Make the 'Cut Text' command (normally ^K) cut from the current cursor position to the end of the line, instead of cutting the entire line.

       -l, --linenumbers
              Display line numbers to the left of the text area.

       -m, --mouse
              Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled, mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a double click), and execute shortcuts.   The  mouse
              will work in the X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.  Text can still be selected through dragging by holding down the Shift key.

       -n, --noread
              Treat any name given on the command line as a new file.  This allows nano to write to named pipes: it will start with a blank buffer, and will write to the pipe when the user saves the
              "file".  This way nano can be used as an editor in combination with for instance gpg without having to write sensitive data to disk first.

       -o directory, --operatingdir=directory
              Set the operating directory.  This makes nano set up something similar to a chroot.

       -p, --preserve
              Preserve the XON and XOFF sequences (^Q and ^S) so they will be caught by the terminal.

       -q, --quiet
              Obsolete option.  Recognized but ignored.

       -r number, --fill=number
              Hard-wrap lines at column number.  If this value is 0 or less, wrapping will occur at the width of the screen less number columns, allowing the wrap point to vary along with the  width
              of the screen if the screen is resized.  The default value is -8.  This option conflicts with -w (--nowrap) -- the last one given takes effect.

       -s program, --speller=program
              Use this alternative spell checker command.

       -t, --tempfile
              Save a changed buffer without prompting (when exiting with ^X).

       -u, --unix
              Save a file by default in Unix format.  This overrides nano's default behavior of saving a file in the format that it had.  (This option has no effect when you also use --noconvert.)

       -v, --view
              Just view the file and disallow editing: read-only mode.

       -w, --nowrap
              Disable the hard-wrapping of long lines.  This option conflicts with -r (--fill) -- the last one given takes effect.

       -x, --nohelp
              Don't show the two help lines at the bottom of the screen.

       -z, --suspend
              Enable the suspend ability.

       -$, --softwrap
              Enable  'soft  wrapping'.   This  will  make  nano attempt to display the entire contents of any line, even if it is longer than the screen width, by continuing it over multiple screen
              lines.  Since '$' normally refers to a variable in the Unix shell, you should specify this option last when using other options (e.g. 'nano -wS$') or pass it separately (e.g. 'nano -wS
              -$').

       -b, -e, -f, -j
              Ignored, for compatibility with Pico.

TOGGLES
       Several of the above options can be switched on and off also while nano is running.  For example, M-L toggles the hard-wrapping of long lines, M-$ toggles soft-wrapping, M-# toggles line num‐
       bers, M-M toggles the mouse, M-I auto-indentation, and M-X the help lines.  See at the end of the ^G help text for a complete list.

INITIALIZATION FILE
       nano will read two configuration files: first the system's nanorc (if it exists), and then the user's nanorc (if it  exists),  either  ~/.nanorc  or  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nano/nanorc  or  ~/.con‐
       fig/nano/nanorc, whichever is encountered first.  See nanorc(5) for more information on the possible contents of those files.

NOTES
       If no alternative spell checker command is specified on the command line nor in one of the nanorc files, nano will check the SPELL environment variable for one.

       In  some  cases  nano will try to dump the buffer into an emergency file.  This will happen mainly if nano receives a SIGHUP or SIGTERM or runs out of memory.  It will write the buffer into a
       file named nano.save if the buffer didn't have a name already, or will add a ".save" suffix to the current filename.  If an emergency file with that name already exists in the current  direc‐
       tory,  it  will  add  ".save" plus a number (e.g. ".save.1") to the current filename in order to make it unique.  In multibuffer mode, nano will write all the open buffers to their respective
       emergency files.

BUGS
       Justifications (^J) are not yet covered by the general undo system.  So after a justification that is not immediately undone, earlier edits cannot be undone any more.  The workaround  is,  of
       course, to exit without saving.

       The recording and playback of keyboard macros works correctly only on a terminal emulator, not on a Linux console (VT), because the latter is a deficient terminal.
