NAME
       pass - stores, retrieves, generates, and synchronizes passwords securely

SYNOPSIS
       pass [ COMMAND ] [ OPTIONS ]... [ ARGS ]...

DESCRIPTION
       pass  is  a  very  simple  password  store  that  keeps passwords inside gpg2(1) encrypted files inside a simple directory tree residing at
       ~/.password-store.  The pass utility provides a series of commands for manipulating the password store, allowing the user to  add,  remove,
       edit, synchronize, generate, and manipulate passwords.

       If  no  COMMAND  is specified, COMMAND defaults to either show or ls, depending on the type of specifier in ARGS. Otherwise COMMAND must be
       one of the valid commands listed below.

       Several of the commands below rely on or provide additional functionality if the password store directory is also a git repository. If  the
       password  store  directory  is  a  git  repository, all password store modification commands will cause a corresponding git commit. See the
       EXTENDED GIT EXAMPLE section for a detailed description using init and git(1).

       The init command must be run before other commands in order to initialize the password store with the correct gpg  key  id.  Passwords  are
       encrypting using the gpg key set with init.

       There is a corresponding bash completion script for use with tab completing password names in bash(1).

COMMANDS
       init [ --path=sub-folder, -p sub-folder ] gpg-id...
              Initialize  new password storage and use gpg-id for encryption. Multiple gpg-ids may be specified, in order to encrypt each password
              with multiple ids. This command must be run first before a password store can be used. If the specified gpg-id is different from the
              key  used in any existing files, these files will be reencrypted to use the new id.  Note that use of gpg-agent(1) is recommended so
              that the batch decryption does not require as much user intervention. If --path or -p is specified, along with an argument,  a  spe‐
              cific  gpg-id  or set of gpg-ids is assigned for that specific sub folder of the password store. If only one gpg-id is given, and it
              is an empty string, then the current .gpg-id file for the specified sub-folder (or root if unspecified) is removed.

       ls subfolder
              List names of passwords inside the tree at subfolder by using the tree(1) program. This command is alternatively named list.

       grep search-string
              Searches inside each decrypted password file for search-string, and displays line containing matched  string  along  with  filename.
              Uses grep(1) for matching. Make use of the GREP_OPTIONS environment variable to set particular options.

       find pass-names...
              List  names  of  passwords  inside  the tree that match pass-names by using the tree(1) program. This command is alternatively named
              search.

       show [ --clip, -c ] pass-name
              Decrypt and print a password named pass-name. If --clip or -c is specified, do not print the password but  instead  copy  the  first
              line to the clipboard using xclip(1) and then restore the clipboard after 45 (or PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME) seconds.

       insert [ --echo, -e | --multiline, -m ] [ --force, -f ] pass-name
              Insert a new password into the password store called pass-name. This will read the new password from standard in. If --echo or -e is
              not specified, disable keyboard echo when the password is entered and confirm the password by asking for it twice. If --multiline or
              -m  is  specified, lines will be read until EOF or Ctrl+D is reached. Otherwise, only a single line from standard in is read. Prompt
              before overwriting an existing password, unless --force or -f is specified. This command is alternatively named add.

       edit pass-name
              Insert a new password or edit an existing password using the default text editor specified by the  environment  variable  EDITOR  or
              using  editor(1) as a fallback. This mode makes use of temporary files for editing, but care is taken to ensure that temporary files
              are created in /dev/shm in order to avoid writing to difficult-to-erase disk sectors. If /dev/shm is not accessible, fallback to the
              ordinary TMPDIR location, and print a warning.

       generate [ --no-symbols, -n ] [ --clip, -c ] [ --in-place, -i | --force, -f ] pass-name pass-length
              Generate  a  new password using pwgen(1) of length pass-length and insert into pass-name. If --no-symbols or -n is specified, do not
              use any non-alphanumeric characters in the generated password.  If --clip or -c is specified, do not print the password but  instead
              copy  it  to  the  clipboard  using  xclip(1) and then restore the clipboard after 45 (or PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME) seconds.  Prompt
              before overwriting an existing password, unless --force or -f is specified. If --in-place or -i is specified, do  not  interactively
              prompt,  and  only  replace  the  first line of the password file with the new generated password, keeping the remainder of the file
              intact.

       rm [ --recursive, -r ] [ --force, -f ] pass-name
              Remove the password named pass-name from the password store. This command is alternatively named remove or delete. If --recursive or
              -r  is  specified,  delete  pass-name  recursively  if it is a directory. If --force or -f is specified, do not interactively prompt
              before removal.

       mv [ --force, -f ] old-path new-path
              Renames the password or directory named old-path to new-path. This command is alternatively named rename. If --force  is  specified,
              silently  overwrite  new-path  if  it  exists.  If new-path ends in a trailing /, it is always treated as a directory. Passwords are
              selectively reencrypted to the corresponding keys of their new destination.

       cp [ --force, -f ] old-path new-path
              Copies the password or directory named old-path to new-path. This command is alternatively named  copy.  If  --force  is  specified,
              silently  overwrite  new-path  if  it  exists.  If new-path ends in a trailing /, it is always treated as a directory. Passwords are
              selectively reencrypted to the corresponding keys of their new destination.

       git git-command-args...
              If the password store is a git repository, pass git-command-args as arguments to git(1) using the password store as the git  reposi‐
              tory. If git-command-args is init, in addition to initializing the git repository, add the current contents of the password store to
              the repository in an initial commit. If the git config key pass.signcommits is set to true, then all commits will  be  signed  using
              user.signingkey  or the default git signing key. This config key may be turned on using: `pass git config --bool --add pass.signcom‐
              mits true`

FILES
       ~/.password-store
              The default password storage directory.

       ~/.password-store/.gpg-id
              Contains  the  default  gpg key identification used for encryption and decryption.  Multiple gpg keys may be specified in this file,
              one per line. If this file exists in any sub directories, passwords inside those sub directories are  encrypted  using  those  keys.
              This should be set using the init command.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PASSWORD_STORE_DIR
              Overrides the default password storage directory.

       PASSWORD_STORE_KEY
              Overrides the default gpg key identification set by init. Keys must not contain spaces and thus use of the hexidecimal key signature
              is recommended.  Multiple keys may be specified separated by spaces.

       PASSWORD_STORE_GIT
              Overrides the default root of the git repository, which is helpful if PASSWORD_STORE_DIR is temporarily set to  a  sub-directory  of
              the default password store.

       PASSWORD_STORE_X_SELECTION
              Overrides the selection passed to xclip, by default clipboard. See xclip(1) for more info.

       PASSWORD_STORE_CLIP_TIME
              Specifies the number of seconds to wait before restoring the clipboard, by default 45 seconds.

       PASSWORD_STORE_UMASK
              Sets the umask of all files modified by pass, by default 077.

       EDITOR The location of the text editor used by edit.
