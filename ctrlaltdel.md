CTRLALTDEL(8)               System Administration               CTRLALTDEL(8)

NAME
       ctrlaltdel - set the function of the Ctrl-Alt-Del combination

SYNOPSIS
       ctrlaltdel hard|soft

DESCRIPTION
       Based  on  examination  of the linux/kernel/reboot.c code, it is clear
       that there are two supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del  sequence
       can perform.

       hard   Immediately  reboot  the  computer  without calling sync(2) and
              without any other preparation.  This is the default.

       soft   Make the kernel send the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the  init
              process  (this  is  always  the  process  with PID 1).  If this
              option is used, the init(8) program must support this  feature.
              Since  there are now several init(8) programs in the Linux com‐
              munity, please consult the documentation for the  version  that
              you are currently using.

       When the command is run without any argument, it will display the cur‐
       rent setting.

       The function of ctrlaltdel is usually set in the /etc/rc.local file.
