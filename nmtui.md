NAME
       nmtui - Text User Interface for controlling NetworkManager

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       nmtui is a curses‐based TUI application for interacting with
       NetworkManager. When starting nmtui, the user is prompted to choose
       the activity to perform unless it was specified as the first argument.

       The supported activities are:

       edit
           Show a connection editor that supports adding, modifying, viewing
           and deleting connections. It provides similar functionality as
           nm-connection-editor.

       connect
           Show a list of available connections, with the option to activate
           or deactivate them. It provides similar functionality as
           nm-applet.

       hostname
           Set the system hostname.

       Corresponding to above activities, nmtui also comes with binaries
       named nmtui-edit, nmtui-connect, and nmtui-hostname to skip the
       selection of the activities.
