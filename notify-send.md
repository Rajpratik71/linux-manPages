NAME
       notify-send - a program to send desktop notifications

SYNOPSIS
       notify-send [OPTIONS] <summary> [body]

DESCRIPTION
       With  notify-send you can send desktop notifications to the user via a notification daemon from the command line.  These notifications can be used to inform the user about an event or display
       some form of information without getting in the user's way.

OPTIONS
       -u, --urgency=LEVEL Specifies the urgency level (low, normal, critical).

       -t, --expire-time=TIME
              The duration, in milliseconds, for the notification to appear on screen.  (Ubuntu's Notify OSD and GNOME Shell both ignore this parameter.)

       -i, --icon=ICON[,ICON...]
              Specifies an icon filename or stock icon to display.

       -c, --category=TYPE[,TYPE...]
              Specifies the notification category.

          Help options:

       -?, --help
              Show this help message

       -h, --hint=TYPE:NAME:VALUE
              Specifies basic extra data to pass. Valid types are int, double, string and byte.
