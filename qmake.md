QMAKE(1)                                General Commands Manual                               QMAKE(1)

NAME
       qmake - cross-platform makefile generator for Qt

SYNOPSIS
       qmake [mode] [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       QMake  has  two  modes, one mode for generating project files based on some heuristics, and the
       other for generating makefiles. Normally you shouldn't need to specify a mode, as makefile gen‚Äê
       eration  is  the  default  mode  for  qmake,  but you may use this to test qmake on an existing
       project.

MODE
       -project
              Put qmake into project file generation mode. In this  mode  qmake  interprets  files  as
              files  to  be  built,  defaults  to *.c; *.ui; *.y; *.l; *.ts; *.xlf; *.qrc; *.h; *.hpp;
              *.hh; *.hxx; *.H; *.cpp; *.cc; *.cxx; *.C.

       -makefile
              Put qmake into makefile generation mode (default). In this mode qmake  interprets  files
              as  project  files  to be processed, if skipped qmake will try to find a project file in
              your current working directory.
