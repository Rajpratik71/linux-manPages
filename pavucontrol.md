NAME
       pavucontrol - A volume control for the PulseAudio sound server

SYNOPSIS
       pavucontrol

DESCRIPTION
       A simple volume control tool (mixer) for the PulseAudio sound server. In contrast to classic mixer tools this one allows you to control
       both the volume of hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It also allows you to redirect a playback stream to another
       output device without interrupting playback.
