NTFSDECRYPT(8)             System Manager's Manual             NTFSDECRYPT(8)

NAME
       ntfsdecrypt - decrypt or update NTFS files encrypted according to EFS

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsdecrypt [options] -k key.pfx device file

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsdecrypt  decrypts  a  file  from an unmounted device and print the
       decrypted data  on  the  standard  output.   It  can  also  update  an
       encrypted file with the encryption key unchanged.

       The  NTFS file encryption (known as EFS) uses a two-level encryption :
       first, the file contents is encrypted with  a  random  symmetric  key,
       then  this  symmetric key is encrypted with the public keys of each of
       the users allowed to decrypt the file (RSA public key encryptions).

       Three symmetric encryption modes are currently implemented in  ntfsde‐
       crypt  :  DESX  (a DES variant), 3DES (triple DES) and AES_256 (an AES
       variant).

       All the encrypted symmetric keys are stored along with the file  in  a
       special  extended  attribute named "$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM".  Usually,
       at least two users are allowed to read the file : its  owner  and  the
       recovery  manager  who  is able to decrypt all the files in a company.
       When backing up an encrypted file, it is important to also backup  the
       corresponding  $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM,  otherwise  the  file cannot be
       decrypted, even by the recovery  manager.  Also  note  that  encrypted
       files  are slightly bigger than apparent, and the option "efs_raw" has
       to be used when backing up encrypted files with ntfs-3g.

       When  ntfsdecrypt  is  used  to  update  a  file,  the  keys  and  the
       $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM are kept unchanged, so a single key file has to
       be designated.

       Note : the EFS encryption is only available in  professional  versions
       of Windows;

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary  of  all  the  options that ntfsdecrypt accepts.
       Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  pre‐
       ceded  by  -  and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter
       options, that don't take an argument, can be combined  into  a  single
       command,  e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be
       abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -i, --inode NUM
              Display or update the contents of a file designated through its
              inode number instead of its name.

       -e, --encrypt
              Update an existing encrypted file and get the new contents from
              the standard input. The full public and private key file has to
              be  designated,  as the symmetric key is kept unchanged, so the
              private key is needed to extract it.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using  a
              mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -k, --keyfile-name key.pfx
              Define  the  file which contains the public and private keys in
              PKCS#12 format.  This file obviously contains the keys  of  one
              of  the  users allowed to decrypt or update the file. It has to
              be extracted from Windows in PKCS#12 format (its  usual  suffix
              is .p12 or .pfx), and it is protected by a passphrase which has
              to be typed in for the keys to be extracted. This  can  be  the
              key  file  of  any user allowed to read the file, including the
              one of the recovery manager.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license of ntfsdecrypt.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

EXAMPLES
       Display the contents of the file hamlet.doc in the directory Documents
       of the root of the NTFS file system on the device /dev/sda1

              ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1 Documents/hamlet.doc

       Update the file hamlet.doc

              ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1 Documents/hamlet.doc < new.doc
