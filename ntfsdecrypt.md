NAME
       ntfsdecrypt - decrypt or update NTFS files encrypted according to EFS

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsdecrypt [options] -k key.pfx device file

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsdecrypt  decrypts a file from an unmounted device and print the decrypted data on the standard output.  It can also update an encrypted
       file with the encryption key unchanged.

       The NTFS file encryption (known as EFS) uses a two-level encryption : first, the file contents is encrypted with a  random  symmetric  key,
       then this symmetric key is encrypted with the public keys of each of the users allowed to decrypt the file (RSA public key encryptions).

       Three  symmetric  encryption  modes  are currently implemented in ntfsdecrypt : DESX (a DES variant), 3DES (triple DES) and AES_256 (an AES
       variant).

       All the encrypted symmetric keys are stored along with the file in a special extended attribute named  "$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM".   Usually,
       at  least  two  users  are allowed to read the file : its owner and the recovery manager who is able to decrypt all the files in a company.
       When backing up an encrypted file, it is important to also backup the corresponding $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM, otherwise the  file  cannot  be
       decrypted,  even by the recovery manager. Also note that encrypted files are slightly bigger than apparent, and the option "efs_raw" has to
       be used when backing up encrypted files with ntfs-3g.

       When ntfsdecrypt is used to update a file, the keys and the $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM are kept unchanged, so a single key file has to be  des‚Äê
       ignated.

       Note : the EFS encryption is only available in professional versions of Windows;

OPTIONS
       Below  is a summary of all the options that ntfsdecrypt accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded
       by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a  single  command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -i, --inode NUM
              Display or update the contents of a file designated through its inode number instead of its name.

       -e, --encrypt
              Update  an  existing encrypted file and get the new contents from the standard input. The full public and private key file has to be
              designated, as the symmetric key is kept unchanged, so the private key is needed to extract it.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -k, --keyfile-name key.pfx
              Define the file which contains the public and private keys in PKCS#12 format.  This file obviously contains the keys of one  of  the
              users  allowed  to  decrypt  or  update the file. It has to be extracted from Windows in PKCS#12 format (its usual suffix is .p12 or
              .pfx), and it is protected by a passphrase which has to be typed in for the keys to be extracted. This can be the key  file  of  any
              user allowed to read the file, including the one of the recovery manager.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license of ntfsdecrypt.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

EXAMPLES
       Display the contents of the file hamlet.doc in the directory Documents of the root of the NTFS file system on the device /dev/sda1

              ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1 Documents/hamlet.doc

       Update the file hamlet.doc

              ntfsdecrypt -k foo.key /dev/sda1 Documents/hamlet.doc < new.doc
