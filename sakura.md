NAME
       sakura - A simple but powerful libvte-based terminal emulator.

SYNOPSIS
       sakura [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       sakura is a terminal emulator based on GTK+ and VTE. It's a terminal emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop
       installed to have a decent terminal emulator.

KEYBINDINGS SUPPORT
       sakura supports keyboard bindings. They are configurable by setting the following properties in your sakura config file
       (~/.config/sakura/sakura.conf).

   ACCELERATORS
       Accelerators can be set to any mask value from the GdkModifierType in gdktypes.h; see:

       http://www.krugle.org/examples/p-6R7SuZt1c28ljzpZ/gdktypes.h

       or, on your own system:

       /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gdk/gdkkeysyms.h

       Mask values can be combined by ORing them.

       For example, to set the delete tab accelerator to Ctrl + Shift:

       del_tab_accelerator=5

       because GDK_SHIFT_MASK has a value of 1 (1 << 0), and GDK_CONTROL_MASK has a value of 4 (1 << 2); ORing them together, you get 5.

       I realise that this configuration is not so friendly to non-programmers, but it is a start. :)

   KEYS
       For example, to set the add tab key to 'T':

       add_tab_key=T

       Before sakura used keycodes instead of strings. They're still valid.

   DEFAULTS
           Ctrl + Shift + T                 -> New tab
           Ctrl + Shift + W                 -> Close current tab
           Ctrl + Shift + C                 -> Copy selected text
           Ctrl + Shift + V                 -> Paste selected text
           Alt  + Left cursor               -> Previous tab
           Alt  + Right cursor              -> Next tab
           Alt  + [1-9]                     -> Switch to tab N (1-9)
           Ctrl + Shift + S                 -> Toggle scrollbar
           Ctrl + Shift + Mouse left button -> Open link
           F11                              -> Fullscreen
           Shift + PageUp                   -> Move up through scrollback by page
           Shift + PageDown                 -> Move down through scrollback by page
           Ctrl + Shift + Up                -> Move up through scrollback by line
           Ctrl + Shift + Down              -> Move down through scrollback by line

       You can also increase and decrease the font size in the GTK+ standard way (not configurable):

           Ctrl + '+'                       -> Increase font size
           Ctrl + '-'                       -> Decrease font size
