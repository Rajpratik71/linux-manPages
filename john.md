JOHN(8)                                                       System Manager's Manual                                                      JOHN(8)

NAME
       john - a tool to find weak passwords of your users

SYNOPSIS
       john [options] password-files

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the john command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the origi‐
       nal program does not have a manual page.  john, better known as John the Ripper, is a tool to find weak passwords of  users  in  a  server.
       John  can use a dictionary or some search pattern as well as a password file to check for passwords. John supports different cracking modes
       and understands many ciphertext formats, like several DES variants, MD5 and blowfish. It can also be used to extract  AFS  and  Windows  NT
       passwords.

USAGE
       To  use  John,  you  just need to supply it a password file and the desired options. If no mode is specified, john will try "single" first,
       then "wordlist" and finally "incremental".

       Once John finds a password, it will be printed to the terminal and saved into a file called ~/.john/john.pot. John will read this file when
       it restarts so it doesn't try to crack already done passwords.

       To see the cracked passwords, use

       john -show passwd

       Important:  do  this  under  the  same directory where the password was cracked (when using the cronjob, /var/lib/john), otherwise it won't
       work.

       While cracking, you can press any key for status, or Ctrl+C to abort the session, saving point information to a file ( ~/.john/john.rec  by
       default).  By  the way, if you press Ctrl+C twice John will abort immediately without saving.  The point information is also saved every 10
       minutes (configurable in the configuration file, ~/.john/john.ini or ~/.john/john.conf ) in case of a crash.

       To continue an interrupted session, run:

       john -restore

       Now, you may notice that many accounts have a disabled shell, you can make John ignore these (assume that shell is called /etc/expired ):

       john -show -shells:-/etc/expired passwd

       You might want to mail all the users who got weak passwords, to tell them to change the passwords. It's  not  always  a  good  idea  though
       (unfortunately, lots of people seem to ignore such mail, it can be used as a hint for crackers, etc), but anyway, I'll assume you know what
       you're doing. Get a copy of the 'mailer' script supplied with John, so you won't change anything that's under /usr/sbin ; edit the  message
       it  sends,  and possibly the mail command inside it (especially if the password file is from a different box than you got John running on).
       Then run:

        ./mailer passwd

       Anyway, you  probably  should  have  a  look  at  /usr/share/doc/john/OPTIONS  for  a  list  of  all  the  command  line  options,  and  at
       /usr/share/doc/john/EXAMPLES for more John usage examples with other cracking modes.

OPTIONS
       All the options recognized by john start with a single dash (`-').  A summary of options is included below.

       -external:MODE
              Enables an external mode, using external functions defined in ~/john.ini's [List.External:MODE] section.

       -format:NAME
              Allows  you  to override the ciphertext format detection. Currently, valid format names are DES, BSDI, MD5, BF, AFS, LM. You can use
              this option when cracking or with '-test'. Note that John can't crack password files with different ciphertext formats at  the  same
              time.

       -groups:[-]GID[,..]
              Tells John to load users of the specified group(s) only.

       -incremental[:MODE]
              Enables  the  incremental  mode,  using  the  specified  ~/john.ini  definition (section [Incremental:MODE], or [Incremental:All] by
              default).

       -makechars:FILE
              Generates a charset file, based on character frequencies from ~/.john/john.pot, for  use  with  the  incremental  mode.  The  entire
              ~/.john/john.pot  will  be  used  for the charset file unless you specify some password files. You can also use an external filter()
              routine with this option.

       -restore[:FILE]
              Continues an interrupted cracking session, reading point information from the specified file (~/.john/john.rec by default).

       -rules Enables wordlist rules, that are read from [List.Rules:Wordlist] in /etc/john/john.conf (or the alternative configuration  file  you
              might specify on the command line).
              This option requires the -wordlist option to be passed as well.

       -salts:[-]COUNT
              This  feature sometimes allows you to achieve better performance. For example you can crack only some salts using '-salts:2' faster,
              and then crack the rest using '-salts:-2'. Total cracking time will be about the same, but you will get some passwords cracked  ear‐
              lier.

       -savemem:LEVEL
              You  might  need  this  option if you don't have enough memory, or don't want John to affect other processes too much. Level 1 tells
              John not to waste memory on login names, so you won't see them while cracking. Higher levels have a performance impact:  you  should
              probably avoid using them unless John doesn't work or gets into swap otherwise.

       -session:FILE
              Allows  you  to  specify another point information file's name to use for this cracking session. This is useful for running multiple
              instances of John in parallel, or just to be able to recover an older session later, not always continue the latest one.

       -shells:[-]SHELL[,..]
              This option is useful to load accounts with a valid shell only, or not to load accounts with a bad shell.  You  can  omit  the  path
              before  a  shell  name,  so  '-shells:csh'  will  match both '/bin/csh' and '/usr/bin/csh', while ´-shells:/bin/csh' will only match
              '/bin/csh'.

       -show  Shows the cracked passwords in a convenient form. You should also specify the password files. You can use this option while  another
              John is cracking, to see what it did so far.

       -single
              Enables the "single crack" mode, using rules from [List.Rules:Single].

       -status[:FILE]
              Prints status of an interrupted or running session. To get an up to date status information of a detached running session, send that
              copy of John a SIGHUP before using this option.

       -stdin These are used to enable the wordlist mode (reading from stdin).

       -stdout[:LENGTH]
              When used with a cracking mode, except for "single crack", makes John print the words it generates to stdout  instead  of  cracking.
              While applying wordlist rules, the significant password length is assumed to be LENGTH, or unlimited by default.

       -test  Benchmarks all the enabled ciphertext format crackers, and tests them for correct operation at the same time.
              This option does not need any file passed as argument. Its only function is to benchmark the system john is running on.

       -users:[-]LOGIN|UID[,..]
              Allows you to filter a few accounts for cracking, etc. A dash before the list can be used to invert the check (that is, load all the
              users that aren't listed).

       -wordlist:FILE
              These are used to enable the wordlist mode, reading words from FILE.

MODES
       John can work in the following modes:

       Wordlist
              John will simply use a file with a list of words that will be checked against the passwords. See RULES for the  format  of  wordlist
              files.

       Single crack
              In this mode, john will try to crack the password using the login/GECOS information as passwords.

       Incremental
              This  is  the most powerful mode. John will try any character combination to resolve the password.  Details about these modes can be
              found in the MODES file in john's documentation, including how to define your own cracking methods.

FILES
       /etc/john/john.conf
              is where you configure how john will behave.

       /etc/john/john-mail.msg
              has the message sent to users when their passwords are successfully cracked.

       /etc/john/john-mail.conf
              is used to configure how john will send messages to users that had their passwords cracked.

       other location, depending on your system.
