NAME
       gnome-control-center - Configure GNOME settings

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-control-center [OPTION...] [PANEL] [ARG...]

DESCRIPTION
       gnome-control-center is a graphical user interface to configure
       various aspects of GNOME.

       When run without arguments, the shell displays the overview, which
       shows all available configuration panels. The overview allows to open
       individual panels by clicking on them. It also has a search entry to
       find panels by searching keywords.

       It is also possible to specify a panel name as commandline argument to
       go directly to that panel. Individual panels may accept further
       arguments to specify which tab to open (for multi-tabbed panels) or
       which item to display (for panels with lists).

       Note that gnome-control-center is not meant to expose each and every
       setting that is available. The settings that can be found here
       represent what is considered useful and commonly needed options. For
       more exotic or uncommon options, you can look at gnome-tweak-tool or
       the gsettings commandline utility.
