DESCRIPTION
       The  blkid  program  is the command-line interface to working with the
       libblkid(3) library.  It can  determine  the  type  of  content  (e.g.
       filesystem or swap) that a block device holds, and also the attributes
       (tokens, NAME=value pairs) from the content metadata  (e.g.  LABEL  or
       UUID fields).

       It  is  recommended  to  use lsblk(8) command to get information about
       block devices, or lsblk --fs to get an  overview  of  filesystems,  or
       findmnt(8) to search in already mounted filesystems.

              lsblk(8)  provides  more  information, better control on output
              formatting, easy to use in scripts and it does not require root
              permissions to get actual information.  blkid reads information
              directly from devices and for non-root users it returns  cached
              unverified  information.   blkid  is mostly designed for system
              services and to test libblkid functionality.

       When device is specified, tokens from only this device are  displayed.
       It  is  possible  to  specify multiple device arguments on the command
       line.  If none is given, all devices which appear in  /proc/partitions
       are shown, if they are recognized.

       blkid  has  two main forms of operation: either searching for a device
       with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying  NAME=value  pairs  for
       one or more specified devices.

       For  security  reasons  blkid  silently  ignores all devices where the
       probing result  is  ambivalent  (multiple  colliding  filesystems  are
       detected).   The low-level probing mode (-p) provides more information
       and extra return code in this case.  It's recommended to use wipefs(8)
       to get a detailed overview and to erase obsolete stuff (magic strings)
       from the device.

OPTIONS
       The size and offset arguments may be followed  by  the  multiplicative
       suffixes  like  KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB,
       PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g.  "K"  has  the  same
       meaning as "KiB"), or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so
       on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       -c, --cache-file cachefile
              Read from cachefile instead of reading from the  default  cache
              file (see the CONFIGURATION FILE section for more details).  If
              you want to start with a clean cache (i.e. don't report devices
              previously scanned but not necessarily available at this time),
              specify /dev/null.

       -d, --no-encoding
              Don't encode non-printing characters.  The non-printing charac‐
              ters  are  encoded  by ^ and M- notation by default.  Note that
              the --output udev output format uses a different encoding which
              cannot be disabled.

       -g, --garbage-collect
              Perform  a garbage collection pass on the blkid cache to remove
              devices which no longer exist.

       -h, --help
              Display a usage message and exit.

       -i, --info
              Display information about I/O Limits (aka I/O  topology).   The
              'export'  output  format is automatically enabled.  This option
              can be used together with the --probe option.

       -k, --list-filesystems
              List all known filesystems and RAIDs and exit.

       -l, --list-one
              Look up only one device that matches the search parameter spec‐
              ified  with  the  --match-token  option.  If there are multiple
              devices that match the specified  search  parameter,  then  the
              device  with the highest priority is returned, and/or the first
              device found at a given priority.  Device  types  in  order  of
              decreasing  priority  are:  Device  Mapper,  EVMS, LVM, MD, and
              finally regular block devices.  If this option  is  not  speci‐
              fied, blkid will print all of the devices that match the search
              parameter.

       -L, --label label
              Look up the device that uses this  filesystem  label;  this  is
              equal  to --list-one --output device --match-token LABEL=label.
              This lookup method is able to reliably  use  /dev/disk/by-label
              udev  symlinks  (dependent  on  a  setting in /etc/blkid.conf).
              Avoid using the symlinks directly; it is not  reliable  to  use
              the symlinks without verification.  The --label option works on
              systems with and without udev.

              Unfortunately, the original blkid(8) from e2fsprogs uses the -L
              option  as  a synonym for -o list.  For better portability, use
              -l -o device -t LABEL=label and -o list in your scripts  rather
              than the -L option.

       -n, --match-types list
              Restrict  the  probing  functions to the specified (comma-sepa‐
              rated) list of superblock types (names).  The list items may be
              prefixed  with  "no"  to  specify  the  types  which  should be
              ignored.  For example:

                blkid --probe --match-types vfat,ext3,ext4 /dev/sda1

              probes for vfat, ext3 and ext4 filesystems, and

                blkid --probe --match-types nominix /dev/sda1

              probes for all  supported  formats  except  minix  filesystems.
              This option is only useful together with --probe.

       -o, --output format
              Use  the specified output format.  Note that the order of vari‐
              ables and devices is not fixed.  See also option -s.  The  for‐
              mat parameter may be:

              full   print all tags (the default)

              value  print the value of the tags

              list   print the devices in a user-friendly format; this output
                     format is unsupported for low-level probing (--probe  or
                     --info).

                     This  output  format  is  DEPRECATED  in  favour  of the
                     lsblk(8) command.

              device print the device name only; this output format is always
                     enabled for the --label and --uuid options

              udev   print  key="value"  pairs  for easy import into the udev
                     environment; the keys are prefixed by ID_FS_ or ID_PART_
                     prefixes

                     The udev output returns the ID_FS_AMBIVALENT tag if more
                     superblocks are detected, and ID_PART_ENTRY_*  tags  are
                     always  returned for all partitions including empty par‐
                     titions.  This output format is DEPRECATED.

              export print key=value pairs for easy import into the  environ‐
                     ment;  this  output format is automatically enabled when
                     I/O Limits (--info option) are requested.

                     The non-printing characters are  encoded  by  ^  and  M-
                     notation  and  all  potentially  unsafe  characters  are
                     escaped.

       -O, --offset offset
              Probe at the given offset (only  useful  with  --probe).   This
              option can be used together with the --info option.

       -p, --probe
              Switch  to  low-level  superblock  probing  mode (bypassing the
              cache).

              Note that low-level probing also returns information about par‐
              tition  table  type  (PTTYPE  tag) and partitions (PART_ENTRY_*
              tags). The tag names produced by low-level probing are based on
              names  used internally by libblkid and it may be different than
              when executed without --probe (for example PART_ENTRY_UUID=  vs
              PARTUUID=).

       -s, --match-tag tag
              For each (specified) device, show only the tags that match tag.
              It is possible to specify multiple --match-tag options.  If  no
              tag is specified, then all tokens are shown for all (specified)
              devices.  In order to just refresh the  cache  without  showing
              any tokens, use --match-tag none with no other options.

       -S, --size size
              Override the size of device/file (only useful with --probe).

       -t, --match-token NAME=value
              Search  for  block devices with tokens named NAME that have the
              value value, and display any devices which are  found.   Common
              values for NAME include TYPE, LABEL, and UUID.  If there are no
              devices specified on the command line, all block  devices  will
              be searched; otherwise only the specified devices are searched.

       -u, --usages list
              Restrict  the  probing  functions to the specified (comma-sepa‐
              rated) list of  "usage"  types.   Supported  usage  types  are:
              filesystem, raid, crypto and other.  The list items may be pre‐
              fixed with "no" to specify the  usage  types  which  should  be
              ignored.  For example:

                blkid --probe --usages filesystem,other /dev/sda1

              probes for all filesystem and other (e.g. swap) formats, and

                blkid --probe --usages noraid /dev/sda1

              probes  for all supported formats except RAIDs.  This option is
              only useful together with --probe.

       -U, --uuid uuid
              Look up the device that uses this filesystem  uuid.   For  more
              details see the --label option.

       -V, --version
              Display version number and exit.

RETURN CODE
       If the specified device or device addressed by specified token (option
       --match-token) was found and it's possible to gather  any  information
       about  the  device,  an  exit  code  0  is  returned.  Note the option
       --match-tag filters output tags, but it does not affect return code.

       If the specified token was not found, or no (specified) devices  could
       be identified, an exit code of 2 is returned.

       For usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is returned.

       If an ambivalent probing result was detected by low-level probing mode
       (-p), an exit code of 8 is returned.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The standard location of the /etc/blkid.conf config file can be  over‐
       ridden  by the environment variable BLKID_CONF.  The following options
       control the libblkid library:

       SEND_UEVENT=<yes|not>
              Sends uevent when /dev/disk/by-{label,uuid,partuuid,partlabel}/
              symlink  does not match with LABEL, UUID, PARTUUID or PARTLABEL
              on the device.  Default is "yes".

       CACHE_FILE=<path>
              Overrides the standard location of the cache file.   This  set‐
              ting  can be overridden by the environment variable BLKID_FILE.
              Default is /run/blkid/blkid.tab, or /etc/blkid.tab  on  systems
              without a /run directory.

       EVALUATE=<methods>
              Defines  LABEL  and  UUID evaluation method(s).  Currently, the
              libblkid library supports the "udev" and "scan" methods.   More
              than  one  method  may  be specified in a comma-separated list.
              Default  is  "udev,scan".   The   "udev"   method   uses   udev
              /dev/disk/by-*  symlinks  and the "scan" method scans all block
              devices from the /proc/partitions file.
