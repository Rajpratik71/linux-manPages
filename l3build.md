NAME
       l3build - Checking and building packages

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       The l3build system is a Lua script for building TeX packages, with particular emphasis on regression testing. It is written in cross-platform Lua code, so can be used by any mod‚Äê
       ern TeX distribution with the texlua interpreter. A package for building with l3build can be written in any TeX dialect; its defaults are set up for LaTeX packages written in the
       DocStrip style.
