NAME
       fixparts - MBR partition table repair utility

SYNOPSIS
       fixparts device

DESCRIPTION
       FixParts (aka fixparts) is a text-mode menu-driven program for repair‐
       ing certain types of problems with Master Boot Record (MBR)  partition
       tables.  The program has three design goals, although a few additional
       features are supported, as well:

       *      It can remove stray GUID Partition Table (GPT) data, which  can
              be  left  behind on a disk that was once used as a GPT disk but
              then incompletely converted to the more common (as of 2011) MBR
              form.

       *      It  can  repair  mis-sized extended partitions -- either parti‐
              tions that extend beyond the physical end of the disk  or  that
              overlap with nearby primary partitions. FixParts is designed in
              such a way that this type of repair occurs automatically, so if
              it's  the  only problem with your disk, you can launch the pro‐
              gram and then immediately save the partition table,  making  no
              manual changes, and the program will fix the problem.

       *      You  can  change  primary partitions into logical partitions or
              vice-versa, within constraints imposed by the MBR  data  struc‐
              tures.

       Additional features include the ability to change partition type codes
       or boot/active flags, to delete partitions, and to recompute CHS  val‐
       ues. With the possible exception of recomputing CHS values, these sec‐
       ondary features are better performed  with  fdisk,  because  fixparts'
       design  means  that it's likely to alter partition numbering even when
       such changes are not requested.

       The fixparts program employs a  user  interface  similar  to  that  of
       Linux's  fdisk,  but  fixparts  is  much more specialized. Most impor‐
       tantly, you can't create new partitions with  fixparts,  although  you
       can change primary/logical assignment.

       In the MBR scheme, partitions come in three varieties:

       primary
              These  partitions  are  defined in the first sector of the hard
              disk and are limited in number to four. Some OSes, such as Win‐
              dows and FreeBSD, must boot from a primary partition.

       extended
              Extended  partitions  are  specialized primary partitions. They
              serve as holding areas for logical partitions.

       logical
              A disk can contain an arbitrary number  of  logical  partitions
              (fixparts, however, imposes a limit of 124 logical partitions).
              All the logical partitions reside inside a single extended par‐
              tition,  and  are  defined  using a linked-list data structure.
              This fact means that every logical partition must  be  preceded
              by  at least one sector of unallocated space to hold its defin‐
              ing data structure (an Extended Boot Record, or EBR).

       These distinctions mean that primary and logical partitions cannot  be
       arbitrarily interspersed. A disk can contain one to three primary par‐
       titions, a block of one or more logical partitions, and one  to  three
       more  primary partitions (for a total of three primary partitions, not
       counting the extended partition). Primary partitions may not be  sand‐
       wiched  between  logical  partitions,  since this would mean placing a
       primary partition within an extended partition (which is just  a  spe‐
       cific type of primary partition).

       Unlike  most disk utilities, fixparts' user interface ignores extended
       partitions. Internally, the program discards the  information  on  the
       original extended partition and, when you tell it to save its changes,
       it generates a new extended partition to contain the then-defined log‐
       ical  partitions. This is done because most of the repairs and manipu‐
       lations the tool performs require generating a fresh  extended  parti‐
       tion,  so  keeping  the original in the user interface would only be a
       complication.

       Another unusual feature of fixparts' user interface is that  partition
       numbers  do  not necessarily correlate with primary/logical status. In
       most utilities,  partitions  1-4  correspond  to  primary  partitions,
       whereas  partitions  5 and up are logical partitions. In fixparts, any
       partition number may be assigned primary or logical status, so long as
       the  rules for layout described earlier are obeyed. When the partition
       table is saved, partitions will be  assigned  appropriately  and  then
       tools  such  as the Linux kernel and fdisk will give them conventional
       numbers.

       When it first starts, fixparts performs a scan for GPT  data.  If  the
       disk  looks  like a conventional GPT disk, fixparts refuses to run. If
       the disk appears to be a conventional MBR disk but GPT signatures  are
       present  in the GPT primary or secondary header areas, fixparts offers
       to delete this extraneous data. If you tell it to do so,  the  program
       immediately  wipes  the GPT header or headers. (If only one header was
       found, only that one header will be erased, to minimize  the  risk  of
       damaging  a boot loader or other data that might have overwritten just
       one of the GPT headers.)

       With the exception of optionally erasing leftover  GPT  data  when  it
       first  starts,  fixparts  keeps  all  changes in memory until the user
       writes changes with the w command. Thus, you can  adjust  your  parti‐
       tions  in  the  user  interface and abort those changes by typing q to
       quit without saving changes.

OPTIONS
       The fixparts utility supports  no  command-line  options,  except  for
       specification of the target device.

       Most  interactions  with fixparts occur with its interactive text-mode
       menu. Specific functions are:

       a      Toggle the active/boot flag. This flag is required by some boot
              loaders and OSes.

       c      Recompute  the cylinder/head/sector (CHS) values for all parti‐
              tions. CHS addressing mode is largely obsolete, but  some  OSes
              and  utilities complain if they don't like the CHS values. Note
              that fixparts' CHS values are likely to be incorrect  on  disks
              smaller than about 8 GiB except on Linux.

       l      Change  a  partition's status to logical. This option will only
              work if the current partition layout supports  such  a  change.
              Note  that  if changing a partition's status in this way is not
              currently possible, making some other change may make it possi‐
              ble.  For instance, omitting a partition that precedes the tar‐
              get partition may enable converting a partition to logical form
              if there had been no free sectors between the two partitions.

       o      Omit a partition. Once omitted, the partition will still appear
              in the fixparts partition list, but it will be flagged as omit‐
              ted. You can subsequently convert it to primary or logical form
              with the r or l commands,  respectively.  When  you  save  your
              changes with w, though, the partition will be lost.

       p      Display basic partition summary data. This includes partition's
              number, the boot/active flag's status, starting and ending sec‐
              tor numbers, primary/logical/omitted status, whether or not the
              partition may be converted to logical form, and the partition's
              MBR types code.

       q      Quit  from  the  program without saving your changes.  Use this
              option if you just wanted to view information or if you make  a
              mistake and want to back out of all your changes.

       r      Change  a  partition's status to primary. This option will only
              work if the current partition layout supports  such  a  change.
              Note  that  every  partition can theoretically become a primary
              partition, although in some configurations, making this  change
              will  require omitting some partitions.  If fixparts refuses to
              allow changing a partition to primary, you may need to  convert
              other partitions to logical form or omit them entirely.

       s      Sort  partition  entries.  This option orders partitions in the
              display to match their on-disk positions, which can make under‐
              standing  the disk layout easier in some cases. This option has
              no effect on the ultimate ordering of logical partitions, which
              are  sorted before being saved. The order of primary partitions
              in the final saved partition table  may  be  affected  by  this
              option.  In both cases, as already noted, the partition numbers
              displayed by fixparts may not be the same as those used by  the
              kernel or displayed by other partitioning tools.

       t      Change a partition's type code. You enter the type code using a
              one-byte hexadecimal number.

       w      Write data. Use this command to save your changes and exit from
              the program.

       ?      Print  the  menu.  Type this command (or any other unrecognized
              command) to see a summary of available options.

BUGS
       Known bugs and limitations include:

       *      The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD,  Mac  OS
              X,  and  Windows.   Linux  versions  for  x86-64  (64-bit), x86
              (32-bit), and PowerPC  (32-bit)  have  been  tested,  with  the
              x86-64  version  having  seen  the most testing. Under FreeBSD,
              32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64)  versions  have  been  tested.
              Only 32-bit versions for Mac OS X and Windows have been tested.

       *      The  FreeBSD  version of the program can't write changes to the
              partition table to a disk when existing partitions on that disk
              are  mounted.  (The same problem exists with many other FreeBSD
              utilities, such as gpt, fdisk, and dd.) This limitation can  be
              overcome  by  typing  sysctl kern.geom.debugflags=16 at a shell
              prompt.

       *      The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4 primary  par‐
              titions  and  124 logical partitions). This limit can be raised
              by changing the #define MAX_MBR_PARTS line  in  the  basicmbr.h
              source code file and recompiling.

       *      The  program  can  read partitions only if the disk has correct
              LBA partition descriptors. These descriptors should be  present
              on  any disk over 8 GiB in size or on smaller disks partitioned
              with any but very ancient software.

       *      The program makes no effort to preserve partition numbers. This
              can  have  consequences  for  boot  loaders  and  for  mounting
              filesystems via /etc/fstab. It may be necessary to edit config‐
              uration files or even to re-install your boot loader.

       *

              The program may change the order of partitions in the partition
              table.
