Name
       getfdprm - print the current format information

Note
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from fdutils's texinfo documentation.  However, this process is only approximative, and some items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices
       are lost in this translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, only the items specific to each command have been translated,  and
       the general information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips fdutils.dvi

       *      To generate a HTML copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

              A pre-made HTML can be found at: `http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info

       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.

Description
          getfdprm [drive]
