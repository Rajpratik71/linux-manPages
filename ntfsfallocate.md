NTFSFALLOCATE(8)           System Manager's Manual           NTFSFALLOCATE(8)

NAME
       ntfsfallocate - preallocate space to a file on an NTFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsfallocate [options] -l length device file [attr-type [attr-name]]

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsfallocate preallocates space for any attribute of a file or direc‐
       tory, thus reserving space before actual contents is written. This  is
       similar to fallocate(1).

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary  of  all the options that ntfsfallocate accepts.
       Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  pre‐
       ceded  by  -  and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter
       options, that don't take an argument, can be combined  into  a  single
       command,  e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be
       abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using  a
              mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -l, --length LENGTH
              This  is  a  mandatory option to specify the number of bytes to
              preallocate.  It will be rounded up to a multiple of the  clus‐
              ter  size.   A  suffix of K, M, G, T, P or E may be appended to
              mean a multiplicative factor of a power of  1000.  Similarly  a
              suffix  of  Ki,  Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi or Ei may be appended to mean a
              multiplicative factor of a power of 1024.

       -n, --no-size-change
              Do not change the apparent size of the file.  The  space  allo‐
              cated  beyond  the  apparent size is not zeroed, but subsequent
              writing beyond the apparent end of file will force zeroing  the
              inner  allocated space as it cannot be considered as a hole any
              more, and this may take significant time.

       -N, --no-action
              Simulate the allocation without actually write to device.

       -o, --offset OFFSET
              Specify the offset in the file where preallocation  starts.  By
              default, the preallocation is counted from the beginning of the
              file. Space already allocated in the area defined by offset and
              length is preserved.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Show  the  version  number, copyright and license of ntfsfallo‐
              cate.

       attr-type
              Define a particular attribute type to be preallocated (advanced
              use  only).   By default, the unnamed $DATA attribute (the con‐
              tents of a plain file) will be preallocated. The attribute  has
              to be specified by a number in decimal or hexadecimal :

              ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Hex     Decimal   Name                     │

              │0x100   256       "$LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM" │
              └───────────────────────────────────────────┘

       attr-name
              Define the name of the particular attribute type to be preallo‐
              cated (advanced use only).

EXAMPLES
       Preallocate 100MB to the file database.db located in the  Data  direc‐
       tory which is at the root of an NTFS file system.

              ntfsfallocate -l 100M /dev/sda1 Data/database.db

BUGS
       There are no known problems with ntfsfallocate, however it can lead to
       configurations not supported by Windows and Windows may  crash  (BSOD)
       when  writing  to preallocated clusters which were not written to ear‐
       lier. Files with preallocated space should  be  fully  be  written  to
       before they are updated by Windows.

       If  you  find  a  bug  in  ntfsfallocate  proper, please send an email
       describing the problem to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net
