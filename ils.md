NAME
       ils - List inode information

SYNOPSIS
       ils [-emOpvV] [-f fstype ] [-s seconds ] [-i imgtype ] [-o imgoffset ] [-b dev_sector_size] image [images] [start-stop]

       ils [-aAlLvVzZ] [-f fstype ] [-s seconds ] [-i imgtype ] [-o imgoffset ] image [images] [start-stop]

DESCRIPTION
       ils opens the named image(s) and lists inode information. By default, ils lists only the inodes of removed files.

       Arguments:

       -e     List every inode in the file system.

       -f fstype
              Specifies  the  file  system  type.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.  If not given, autodetection methods are
              used.

       -s seconds
              The time skew of the original system in seconds.  For example, if the original system was 100 seconds  slow,  this  value  would  be
              -100.

       -m     Display the inode details in the format that the mactime program reads (replaces the ils2mac script from TCT)

       -O     List  only inodes of removed files that are still open or executing.  This option is short-hand notation for -aL "(see the fine con‚Äê
              trols section below). (this used to be -o).

       -p     Display orphan inodes (unallocated with no file name)

       -r     (default) List only inodes of removed files. This option is short-hand notation for -LZ (see the fine controls section below).

       -i imgtype
              Identify the type of image file, such as raw.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If not given, autodetection  methods  are
              used.

       -o imgoffset
              The sector offset where the file system starts in the image.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The  size,  in  bytes,  of  the  underlying  device  sectors.  If not given, the value in the image format is used (if it exists) or
              512-bytes is assumed.

       -v     Turn on verbose mode, output to stderr.

       -V     Display Version.

       image [images]
              The disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '-i'.  Multiple image file names can be given if the image is  split
              into  multiple  segments.  If only one image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by ending in
              '.001'), subsequent image segments will be included automatically.

       start-stop
              Examine the specified inode number or number range.

       Fine controls:

       -a     List only allocated inodes: these belong to files with at least one directory entry in the file system, and to  removed  files  that
              are still open or executing.

       -A     List only unallocated inodes: these belong to files that no longer exist.

       -l     List only inodes with at least one hard link. These belong to files with at least one directory entry in the file system.

       -L     List  only  inodes  without  any hard links. These belong to files that no longer exist, and to removed files that are still open or
              executing.

       -z     List only inodes that were likely to have not been used.

       -Z     List only inodes that were likely to be used.

       The output format is in time machine format.  The output begins with a two-line header that describes the data origin, and is followed by a
       one-line header that lists the names of the data attributes that make up the remainder of the output:

       st_ino The inode number.

       st_alloc
              Allocation status: `a' for allocated inode, `f' for free inode.

       st_uid Owner user ID.

       st_gid Owner group ID.

       st_mtime
              UNIX time (seconds) of last file modification.

       st_atime
              UNIX time (seconds) of last file access.

       st_ctime
              UNIX time (seconds) of last inode status change.

       st_dtime
              UNIX time (seconds) of file deletion (LINUX only).

       st_mode
              File type and permissions (octal).

       st_nlink
              Number of hard links.

       st_size
              File size in bytes.

       st_block0,st_block1
              The first two entries in the direct block address list.
