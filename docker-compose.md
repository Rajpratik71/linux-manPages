DOCKER-COMPOSE(1)             User Commands            DOCKER-COMPOSE(1)

NAME
       docker-compose - Define and run multi-container applications with
       Docker.

SYNOPSIS
       docker-compose [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [ARGS]...

DESCRIPTION
       docker-compose allows you to define a multi-container application
       with  all  of  its  dependencies  in a single file, then spin the
       application up in a single command. The  application’s  structure
       and  configuration  are held in a single place, which makes spin‐
       ning up applications simple and repeatable everywhere.

OPTIONS
       -f, --file FILE
              Specify an alternate compose  file  (default:  docker-com‐
              pose.yml)

       -p, --project-name NAME
              Specify  an  alternate  project  name  (default: directory
              name)

       --verbose
              Show more output

       -v, --version
              Print version and exit

COMMANDS
   build
       Build or rebuild services

       --no-cache
              Do not use cache when building the image.

   help
       Displays help and usage information on a command.

   kill
       Forces running containers to stop by sending a SIGKILL signal.

       -s SIGNAL
              SIGNAL  to  send  to  the  container.  Default  signal  is
              SIGKILL.

   logs
       View output from containers.

       --no-color
              Produce a monochrome output.

   port
       Print the public port for a port binding

       --protocol=proto
              Choose the 4th layer protocol, tcp or udp. Default is tcp.

       --index=index
              Index  of the container if there are multiple instances of
              a service. Default is 1.

   ps
       List containers.

       -q     Only display IDs.

   pull
       Pulls service images from Docker registry.

       --allow-insecure-ssl
              Allow insecure connections to the Docker registry.

   restart
       Restart running containers.

       -t, --timeout TIMEOUT
              Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds. Default is 10.

   rm
       Remove stopped service containers

       -f, --force
              Do not ask to confirm removal.

       -v     Remove volumes associated with containers.

   run
       Run a one-off command on a service. By  default  linked  services
       will be started, unless they are already running.

       --allow-insecure-ssl
              Allow insecure connections to the Docker registry.

       -d     Detached  mode. Run container in the background, print new
              container name.

       --entrypoint CMD
              Override the entrypoint of the image with CMD.

       -e KEY=VAL
              Set an environment variable. Can be used multiple times.

       -u, --user=USER
              Run as a specific USER, a username or uid.

       --no-deps
              Do not start linked services.

       --rm   Remove container after run. This option is ignored in  the
              detached mode.

       --service-ports
              Run command with the service's ports enabled and mapped to
              the host.

       -T     Disable pseudo tty allocation. By default a tty  is  allo‐
              cated.

   scale
       Set number of containers to run for a service. Numbers are speci‐
       fied in the form service=num as arguments.

              # docker-compose scale web=2 worker=3

   start
       Start existing containers.

   stop
       Stop running containers without removing them.

       -t, --timeout TIMEOUT
              Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds. Default is 10.

   up
       Build, (re)create, start and attach to containers.  If there  are
       existing  containers for a service, `docker-compose up` will stop
       and recreate them (preserving mounted volumes with volumes-from),
       so  that changes in `docker-compose.yml` are picked up. If you do
       not want existing containers to be recreated, `docker-compose  up
       --no-recreate` will re-use existing containers.

       --allow-insecure-ssl
              Allow insecure connections to the Docker registry.

       -d     Detached  mode. Run container in the background, print new
              container name.

       --no-color
              Produce a monochrome output.

       --no-deps
              Do not start linked services.

       --x-smart-recreate
              Only recreate  containers  whose  configuration  or  image
              needs to be updated. This feature is experimental.

       --no-recreate
              If containers already exist, do not recreate them.

       --no-build
              Do not build an image even if it is missing.

       -t, --timeout TIMEOUT
              Specify a shutdown timeout in seconds. Default is 10.

   migrate-to-labels
       Recreate containers to add labels. If docker-compose detects con‐
       tainers that were created without labels, it will refuse  to  run
       so that you don't end up with two sets of them.

ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       Several   environmental  variables  are  available  to  configure
       docker-compose behavior.

       Variables starting with DOCKER_ are the same  as  those  used  to
       configure   the  Docker  command-line  client.  If  you're  using
       boot2docker, eval "$(boot2docker shellinit)"  will  set  them  to
       their correct values.

   COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME
       Sets  the  project  name, which is prepended to the name of every
       container started by docker-compose.  Defaults to the basename of
       the current working directory.

   COMPOSE_FILE
       Specify  what  file  to read configuration from. If not provided,
       docker-compose will look for docker-compose.yml  in  the  current
       working  directory,  and then each parent directory successively,
       until found.

   DOCKER_HOST
       Sets the URL of the docker daemon. As  with  the  Docker  client,
       defaults to unix:///var/run/docker.sock.

   DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY
       When set to anything other than an empty string, enables TLS com‐
       munication with the daemon.

   DOCKER_CERT_PATH
       Configures the path to the ca.pem, cert.pem,  and  key.pem  files
       used for TLS verification.  Defaults to ~/.docker.
