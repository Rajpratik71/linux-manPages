FSCK.FAT(8)                             System Manager's Manual                            FSCK.FAT(8)

NAME
       fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.fat [OPTIONS] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and optionally tries to repair them.

       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this order):

       *   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to EOF.

       *   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.

       *   Bad  clusters  (read  errors).  The clusters are marked bad and they are removed from files
           owning them.  This check is optional.

       *   Directories with a large number of bad entries (probably corrupt).  The  directory  can  be
           deleted.

       *   Files . and .. are non-directories.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       *   Directories . and .. in root directory.  They are deleted.

       *   Bad filenames.  They can be renamed.

       *   Duplicate directory entries.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       *   Directories with non-zero size field.  Size is set to zero.

       *   Directory . does not point to parent directory.  The start pointer is adjusted.

       *   Directory .. does not point to parent of parent directory.  The start pointer is adjusted.

       *   Start cluster number of a file is invalid.  The file is truncated.

       *   File contains bad or free clusters.  The file is truncated.

       *   File's cluster chain is longer than indicated by the size fields.  The file is truncated.

       *   Two  or  more files share the same cluster(s).  All but one of the files are truncated.  If
           the file being truncated is a directory file that has already  been  read,  the  filesystem
           check is restarted after truncation.

       *   File's cluster chain is shorter than indicated by the size fields.  The file is truncated.

       *   Clusters are marked as used but are not owned by a file.  They are marked as free.

       Additionally, the following problems are detected, but not repaired:

       *   Invalid parameters in boot sector

       *   Absence of . and .. entries in non-root directories

       When  fsck.fat checks a filesystem, it accumulates all changes in memory and performs them only
       after all checks are complete.  This can be disabled with the -w option.

OPTIONS
       -a  Automatically repair the filesystem.  No user intervention is necessary.  Whenever there is
           more than one method to solve a problem, the least destructive approach is used.

       -A  Use  Atari  variation  of  the MS-DOS filesystem.  This is default if fsck.fat is run on an
           Atari, then this option turns off Atari format.  There are some minor differences in  Atari
           format: Some boot sector fields are interpreted slightly different, and the special FAT en‐
           tries for end-of-file and bad cluster can be different.  Under MS-DOS 0xfff8  is  used  for
           EOF  and  Atari  employs  0xffff  by  default,  but  both systems recognize all values from
           0xfff8...0xffff as end-of-file.  MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7 for bad clusters, where  on  Atari
           values 0xfff0...0xfff7 are for this purpose (but the standard value is still 0xfff7).

       -b  Make read-only boot sector check.

       -c PAGE
           Use DOS codepage PAGE to decode short file names.  By default codepage 437 is used.

       -d PATH
           Delete  the  specified  file.  If more than one file with that name exist, the first one is
           deleted.  This option can be given more than once.

       -f  Salvage unused cluster chains to files.  By default, unused clusters are added to the  free
           disk space except in auto mode (-a).

       -l  List path names of files being processed.

       -n  No-operation  mode:  non-interactively  check  for  errors, but don't write anything to the
           filesystem.

       -p  Same as -a, for compatibility with other *fsck.

       -r  Interactively repair the filesystem.  The user is asked for advice whenever there  is  more
           than one approach to fix an inconsistency.  This is the default mode and the option is only
           retained for backwards compatibility.

       -t  Mark unreadable clusters as bad.

       -u PATH
           Try to undelete the specified file.  fsck.fat tries to allocate a chain of contiguous unal‐
           located  clusters  beginning with the start cluster of the undeleted file.  This option can
           be given more than once.

       -v  Verbose mode.  Generates slightly more output.

       -V  Perform a verification pass.  The filesystem check is repeated after the  first  run.   The
           second  pass  should never report any fixable errors.  It may take considerably longer than
           the first pass, because the first pass may have generated long list of  modifications  that
           have to be scanned for each disk read.

       -w  Write changes to disk immediately.

       -y  Same as -a (automatically repair filesystem) for compatibility with other fsck tools.

EXIT STATUS
       0   No recoverable errors have been detected.

       1   Recoverable errors have been detected or fsck.fat has discovered an internal inconsistency.

       2   Usage error.  fsck.fat did not access the filesystem.

FILES
       fsck0000.rec, fsck0001.rec, ...
           When recovering from a corrupted filesystem, fsck.fat dumps recovered data into files named
           'fsckNNNN.rec' in the top level directory of the filesystem.

BUGS
       Does not create . and .. files where necessary.  Does not remove  entirely  empty  directories.
       Should  give  more diagnostic messages.  Undeleting files should use a more sophisticated algo‐
       rithm.
