NAME
       xfs_mdrestore - restores an XFS metadump image to a filesystem image

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_mdrestore [ -g ] source target
       xfs_mdrestore -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_mdrestore  is  a  debugging  tool that restores a metadata image generated by xfs_metadump(8) to a filesystem. The source argument specifies the location of the metadump image and the target
       argument specifies the destination for the filesystem image.  If the source is -, then the metadata image is read from stdin. This allows the output of be another program such as  a  compression
       application to be redirected to xfs_mdrestore.  The target can be either a file or a device.

       xfs_mdrestore should not be used to restore metadata onto an existing filesystem unless you are completely certain the target can be destroyed.

OPTIONS
       -g     Shows restore progress on stdout.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.

DIAGNOSTICS
       xfs_mdrestore returns an exit code of 0 if all the metadata is successfully restored or 1 if an error occurs.
