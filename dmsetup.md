DESCRIPTION
       dmsetup  manages  logical  devices  that use the device-mapper driver.
       Devices are created by loading a table that  specifies  a  target  for
       each sector (512 bytes) in the logical device.

       The  first  argument  to dmsetup is a command.  The second argument is
       the logical device name or uuid.

       Invoking the dmsetup tool as devmap_name (which is not  normally  dis‐
       tributed  and  is supported only for historical reasons) is equivalent
       to dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j major -m minor.

OPTIONS
       --addnodeoncreate
              Ensure /dev/mapper node exists after dmsetup create.

       --addnodeonresume
              Ensure /dev/mapper node exists after  dmsetup  resume  (default
              with udev).

       --checks
              Perform  additional  checks  on  the  operations  requested and
              report potential problems.  Useful when debugging scripts.   In
              some cases these checks may slow down operations noticeably.

       -c|-C|--columns
              Display output in columns rather than as Field: Value lines.

       --count count
              Specify  the  number  of  times to repeat a report. Set this to
              zero continue until interrupted.  The default interval  is  one
              second.

       -f|--force
              Try harder to complete operation.

       -h|--help
              Outputs a summary of the commands available, optionally includ‐
              ing the list of report fields (synonym with help command).

       --inactive
              When returning any table information from the kernel report  on
              the  inactive table instead of the live table.  Requires kernel
              driver version 4.16.0 or above.

       --interval seconds
              Specify the interval in seconds between  successive  iterations
              for  repeating  reports. If --interval is specified but --count
              is not, reports will continue to repeat until interrupted.  The
              default interval is one second.

       --manglename auto|hex|none
              Mangle  any  character  not  on a whitelist using mangling_mode
              when processing device-mapper device names and UUIDs. The names
              and  UUIDs  are  mangled on input and unmangled on output where
              the mangling mode is one of: auto (only do the mangling if  not
              mangled  yet,  do  nothing if already mangled, error on mixed),
              hex (always do the mangling) and none (no  mangling).   Default
              mode  is  auto.   Character whitelist: 0-9, A-Z, a-z, #+-.:=@_.
              This whitelist is also supported by udev. Any character not  on
              a  whitelist  is  replaced with its hex value (two digits) pre‐
              fixed  by  \x.   Mangling  mode  could  be  also  set   through
              DM_DEFAULT_NAME_MANGLING_MODE environment variable.

       -j|--major major
              Specify the major number.

       -m|--minor minor
              Specify the minor number.

       -n|--notable
              When creating a device, don't load any table.

       --nameprefixes
              Add  a  "DM_" prefix plus the field name to the output.  Useful
              with --noheadings to produce a list of field=value  pairs  that
              can  be  used  to  set  environment  variables (for example, in
              udev(7) rules).

       --noheadings Suppress the headings line when using columnar output.

       --noflush Do not flush outstading I/O when suspending a device, or  do
              not commit thin-pool metadata when obtaining thin-pool status.

       --nolockfs
              Do  not attempt to synchronize filesystem eg, when suspending a
              device.

       --noopencount
              Tell the kernel not to supply the open reference count for  the
              device.

       --noudevrules
              Do  not allow udev to manage nodes for devices in device-mapper
              directory.

       --noudevsync
              Do not synchronise with udev when creating, renaming or  remov‐
              ing devices.

       -o|--options options
              Specify which fields to display.

       --readahead [+]sectors|auto|none
              Specify read ahead size in units of sectors.  The default value
              is auto which allows the kernel  to  choose  a  suitable  value
              automatically.   The  + prefix lets you specify a minimum value
              which will not be used if it is smaller than the  value  chosen
              by  the  kernel.   The  value  none is equivalent to specifying
              zero.

       -r|--readonly
              Set the table being loaded read-only.

       -S|--select selection
              Process only items that match selection criteria.  If the  com‐
              mand  is  producing report output, adding the "selected" column
              (-o selected) displays all rows and shows 1 if the row  matches
              the  selection  and  0  otherwise.  The  selection criteria are
              defined by specifying column names and their valid values while
              making  use  of supported comparison operators. As a quick help
              and to see full list of column names that can be used in selec‐
              tion  and  the  set of supported selection operators, check the
              output of dmsetup info -c -S help command.

       --table table
              Specify a one-line table directly on  the  command  line.   See
              below for more information on the table format.

       --udevcookie cookie
              Use  cookie for udev synchronisation.  Note: Same cookie should
              be used for same type of operations i.e. creation  of  multiple
              different devices. It's not adviced to combine different opera‐
              tions on the single device.

       -u|--uuid
              Specify the uuid.

       -y|--yes
              Answer yes to all prompts automatically.

       -v|--verbose [-v|--verbose]
              Produce additional output.

       --verifyudev
              If udev synchronisation is enabled, verify that udev operations
              get  performed  correctly  and  try  to fix up the device nodes
              afterwards if not.

       --version
              Display the library and kernel driver version.

COMMANDS
       clear device_name
              Destroys the table in the inactive table slot for device_name.

       create device_name [-u|--uuid uuid]
              [--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume] [-n|--notable|--table
              table|table_file] [--readahead [+]sectors|auto|none]
              Creates a device with the given name.  If table  or  table_file
              is  supplied,  the  table is loaded and made live.  Otherwise a
              table is read from standard input  unless  --notable  is  used.
              The optional uuid can be used in place of device_name in subse‐
              quent dmsetup commands.  If successful the device  will  appear
              in  table  and for live device the node /dev/mapper/device_name
              is created.  See below for more information on the  table  for‐
              mat.

       create --concise [concise_device_specification]
              Creates  one  or  more devices from a concise device specifica‐
              tion.  Each device is  specified  by  a  comma-separated  list:
              name,  uuid,  minor number, flags, comma-separated table lines.
              Flags defaults to read-write (rw) or  may  be  read-only  (ro).
              Uuid,  minor  number and flags are optional so those fields may
              be empty.  A semi-colon separates specifications  of  different
              devices.   Use  a  backslash to escape the following character,
              for example a comma or semi-colon in a name or table. See  also
              CONCISE FORMAT below.

       deps [-o options] [device_name...]
              Outputs  a list of devices referenced by the live table for the
              specified device. Device names on output can be  customised  by
              following  options:  devno  (major  and  minor  pair,  used  by
              default), blkdevname (block device name), devname (map name for
              device-mapper devices, equal to blkdevname otherwise).

       help [-c|-C|--columns]
              Outputs a summary of the commands available, optionally includ‐
              ing the list of report fields.

       info [device_name...]
              Outputs some brief information about the device in the form:
                      State: SUSPENDED|ACTIVE, READ-ONLY
                      Tables present: LIVE and/or INACTIVE
                      Open reference count
                      Last event sequence number (used by wait)
                      Major and minor device number
                      Number of targets in the live table
                      UUID

       info -c|-C|--columns [--count count] [--interval seconds]
              [--nameprefixes] [--noheadings] [-o fields] [-O|--sort
              sort_fields] [--separator separator] [device_name]
              Output you can customise.  Fields are comma-separated and  cho‐
              sen  from  the  following list: name, major, minor, attr, open,
              segments, events, uuid.  Attributes  are:  (L)ive,  (I)nactive,
              (s)uspended,  (r)ead-only, read-(w)rite.  Precede the list with
              '+' to append to the default selection of  columns  instead  of
              replacing  it.   Precede  any sort field with '-' for a reverse
              sort on that column.

       ls [--target target_type] [--exec command] [--tree] [-o options]
              List device names.  Optionally only list devices that  have  at
              least  one  target of the specified type.  Optionally execute a
              command for each device.  The device name is  appended  to  the
              supplied  command.  Device names on output can be customised by
              following  options:  devno  (major  and  minor  pair,  used  by
              default), blkdevname (block device name), devname (map name for
              device-mapper devices, equal to blkdevname otherwise).   --tree
              displays  dependencies between devices as a tree.  It accepts a
              comma-separate list of options.  Some specify  the  information
              displayed   against  each  node:  device/nodevice;  blkdevname;
              active, open, rw, uuid.  Others specify how the  tree  is  dis‐
              played: ascii, utf, vt100; compact, inverted, notrunc.

       load|reload device_name [--table table|table_file]
              Loads  table  or  table_file  into  the inactive table slot for
              device_name.  If neither is supplied, reads a table from  stan‐
              dard input.

       mangle [device_name...]
              Ensure  existing  device-mapper  device_name and UUID is in the
              correct mangled form  containing  only  whitelisted  characters
              (supported by udev) and do a rename if necessary. Any character
              not on the whitelist will be mangled based on the  --manglename
              setting.  Automatic  rename works only for device names and not
              for device UUIDs because the kernel does not allow changing the
              UUID  of  active devices. Any incorrect UUIDs are reported only
              and they must be manually corrected by deactivating the  device
              first  and  then reactivating it with proper mangling mode used
              (see also --manglename).

       message device_name sector message
              Send message to target. If sector not needed use 0.

       mknodes [device_name...]
              Ensure that the node in /dev/mapper for device_name is correct.
              If  no  device_name  is  supplied,  ensure  that  all  nodes in
              /dev/mapper correspond to mapped devices  currently  loaded  by
              the  device-mapper  kernel driver, adding, changing or removing
              nodes as necessary.

       remove [-f|--force] [--retry] [--deferred] device_name...
              Removes a device.  It will no longer  be  visible  to  dmsetup.
              Open devices cannot be removed, but adding --force will replace
              the table with one that fails all I/O.  --deferred will  enable
              deferred  removal  of open devices - the device will be removed
              when the last user closes it. The deferred removal  feature  is
              supported  since  version  4.27.0  of  the device-mapper driver
              available in upstream kernel version 3.13.  (Use  dmsetup  ver‐
              sion  to  check this.)  If an attempt to remove a device fails,
              perhaps because a process run from a quick udev rule  temporar‐
              ily opened the device, the --retry option will cause the opera‐
              tion to be retried for a few seconds before  failing.   Do  NOT
              combine  --force and --udevcookie, as udev may start to process
              udev rules in the middle of error target replacement and result
              in nondeterministic result.

       remove_all [-f|--force] [--deferred]
              Attempts  to  remove  all  device  definitions  i.e.  reset the
              driver.  This also runs mknodes  afterwards.   Use  with  care!
              Open devices cannot be removed, but adding --force will replace
              the table with one that fails all I/O.  --deferred will  enable
              deferred  removal  of open devices - the device will be removed
              when the last user closes it.  The deferred removal feature  is
              supported  since  version  4.27.0  of  the device-mapper driver
              available in upstream kernel version 3.13.

       rename device_name new_name
              Renames a device.

       rename device_name --setuuid uuid
              Sets the uuid of a device that  was  created  without  a  uuid.
              After a uuid has been set it cannot be changed.

       resume device_name...  [--addnodeoncreate|--addnodeonresume]
              [--noflush] [--nolockfs] [--readahead [+]sectors|auto|none]
              Un-suspends a device.  If an inactive table has been loaded, it
              becomes  live.   Postponed I/O then gets re-queued for process‐
              ing.

       setgeometry device_name cyl head sect start
              Sets the device geometry to C/H/S.

       splitname device_name [subsystem]
              Splits given device  name  into  subsystem  constituents.   The
              default subsystem is LVM.  LVM currently generates device names
              by concatenating the names of the Volume Group, Logical  Volume
              and any internal Layer with a hyphen as separator.  Any hyphens
              within the names are  doubled  to  escape  them.   The  precise
              encoding  might change without notice in any future release, so
              we recommend you always decode using  the  current  version  of
              this command.

       stats command [options]
              Manages  IO statistics regions for devices.  See dmstats(8) for
              more details.

       status [--target target_type] [--noflush] [device_name...]
              Outputs status information for each of  the  device's  targets.
              With  --target, only information relating to the specified tar‐
              get type any is displayed.  With  --noflush,  the  thin  target
              (from  version 1.3.0) doesn't commit any outstanding changes to
              disk before reporting its statistics.

       suspend [--nolockfs] [--noflush] device_name...
              Suspends a device.  Any I/O that has already been mapped by the
              device  but has not yet completed will be flushed.  Any further
              I/O to that device will be postponed for as long as the  device
              is suspended.  If there's a filesystem on the device which sup‐
              ports the operation, an attempt will be made to sync  it  first
              unless  --nolockfs  is  specified.  Some targets such as recent
              (October 2006) versions of multipath may support the  --noflush
              option.  This lets outstanding I/O that has not yet reached the
              device to remain unflushed.

       table [--concise] [--target target_type] [--showkeys] [device_name...]
              Outputs the current table for the device in a format  that  can
              be  fed back in using the create or load commands.  With --tar‐
              get, only information relating to the specified target type  is
              displayed.   Real  encryption  keys are suppressed in the table
              output for the crypt target unless the --showkeys parameter  is
              supplied.  Kernel  key  references  prefixed  with  :  are  not
              affected by the  parameter  and  get  displayed  always.   With
              --concise,  the output is presented concisely on a single line.
              Commas then separate the name, uuid, minor device number, flags
              ('ro' or 'rw') and the table (if present). Semi-colons separate
              devices. Backslashes escape any commas,  semi-colons  or  back‐
              slashes.  See CONCISE FORMAT below.

       targets
              Displays  the  names  and versions of the currently-loaded tar‐
              gets.

       udevcomplete cookie
              Wake any processes that are waiting for udev to  complete  pro‐
              cessing the specified cookie.

       udevcomplete_all [age_in_minutes]
              Remove  all cookies older than the specified number of minutes.
              Any process waiting on a cookie will be resumed immediately.

       udevcookie
              List all existing cookies. Cookies are  system-wide  semaphores
              with keys prefixed by two predefined bytes (0x0D4D).

       udevcreatecookie
              Creates  a new cookie to synchronize actions with udev process‐
              ing.  The output is a cookie value. Normally we don't  need  to
              create cookies since dmsetup creates and destroys them for each
              action automatically. However, we can generate  one  explicitly
              to  group  several  actions  together  and  use only one cookie
              instead. We can define a cookie to use for each  relevant  com‐
              mand by using --udevcookie option. Alternatively, we can export
              this value into the  environment  of  the  dmsetup  process  as
              DM_UDEV_COOKIE  variable and it will be used automatically with
              all subsequent commands until it is unset.  Invoking this  com‐
              mand will create system-wide semaphore that needs to be cleaned
              up explicitly by calling udevreleasecookie command.

       udevflags cookie
              Parses given cookie value and extracts any udev  control  flags
              encoded.  The output is in environment key format that is suit‐
              able for use in udev rules. If the flag has its  symbolic  name
              assigned  then  the  output  is DM_UDEV_FLAG_<flag_name> = '1',
              DM_UDEV_FLAG<flag_position> = '1'  otherwise.   Subsystem  udev
              flags  don't  have  symbolic  names assigned and these ones are
              always reported as DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG<flag_position> = '1'.
              There are 16 udev flags altogether.

       udevreleasecookie [cookie]
              Waits  for  all  pending  udev processing bound to given cookie
              value and clean up the cookie with underlying semaphore. If the
              cookie  is  not  given  directly, the command will try to use a
              value defined by DM_UDEV_COOKIE environment variable.

       version
              Outputs version information.

       wait [--noflush] device_name [event_nr]
              Sleeps  until  the  event  counter  for   device_name   exceeds
              event_nr.   Use  -v  to see the event number returned.  To wait
              until the next event is triggered, use info to  find  the  last
              event  number.   With  --noflush, the thin target (from version
              1.3.0) doesn't commit any outstanding changes  to  disk  before
              reporting its statistics.

       wipe_table device_name...  [-f|--force] [--noflush] [--nolockfs]
              Wait for any I/O in-flight through the device to complete, then
              replace the table with a new table that fails any new I/O  sent
              to  the device.  If successful, this should release any devices
              held open by the device's table(s).

TABLE FORMAT
       Each line of the table specifies a single target and is of the form:

       logical_start_sector num_sectors target_type target_args

       Simple target types and target args include:

       linear destination_device start_sector
              The traditional linear mapping.

       striped num_stripes chunk_size [destination start_sector]...
              Creates a striped area.
              e.g. striped 2 32 /dev/hda1 0 /dev/hdb1 0 will  map  the  first
              chunk (16k) as follows:
                      LV chunk 1-> hda1, chunk 1
                      LV chunk 2-> hdb1, chunk 1
                      LV chunk 3-> hda1, chunk 2
                      LV chunk 4-> hdb1, chunk 2
                      etc.

       error  Errors  any  I/O that goes to this area.  Useful for testing or
              for creating devices with holes in them.

       zero   Returns blocks of zeroes on reads.  Any data  written  is  dis‐
              carded  silently.   This  is  a  block-device equivalent of the
              /dev/zero character-device data sink described in null(4).

       More complex targets include:

       cache  Improves performance of a  block  device  (eg,  a  spindle)  by
              dynamically  migrating  some  of  its  data to a faster smaller
              device (eg, an SSD).

       crypt  Transparent encryption of block devices using the kernel crypto
              API.

       delay  Delays  reads  and/or  writes to different devices.  Useful for
              testing.

       flakey Creates a similar mapping to the  linear  target  but  exhibits
              unreliable behaviour periodically.  Useful for simulating fail‐
              ing devices when testing.

       mirror Mirrors data across two or more devices.

       multipath
              Mediates access through multiple paths to the same device.

       raid   Offers an interface to the kernel's software raid driver, md.

       snapshot
              Supports snapshots of devices.

       thin, thin-pool
              Supports thin provisioning of devices and also provides a  bet‐
              ter snapshot support.

       To find out more about the various targets and their table formats and
       status lines, please read the files in the Documentation/device-mapper
       directory in the kernel source tree.  (Your distribution might include
       a copy of this information in  the  documentation  directory  for  the
       device-mapper package.)

CONCISE FORMAT
       A concise representation of one of more devices.

       - A comma separates the fields of each device.
       - A semi-colon separates devices.

       The representation of a device takes the form:

              <name>,<uuid>,<minor>,<flags>,<table>[,<ta‐
              ble>+][;<dev_name>,<uuid>,<minor>,<flags>,<table>[,<table>+]]

       The fields are:

       name   The name of the device.

       uuid   The UUID of the device (or empty).

       minor  The minor number of the device.  If empty, the kernel assigns a
              suitable minor number.

       flags  Supported flags are:

              ro Sets the table being loaded for the device read-only
              rw  Sets  the  table  being  loaded  for  the device read-write
              (default)

       table  One line of the table. See TABLE FORMAT above.

EXAMPLES
       # A simple linear read-only device
       test-linear-small,,,ro,0 2097152 linear /dev/loop0 0, 2097152  2097152
       linear /dev/loop1 0

       # Two linear devices
       test-linear-small,,,,0    2097152    linear   /dev/loop0   0;test-lin‐
       ear-large,,,, 0 2097152 linear /dev/loop1 0,  2097152  2097152  linear
       /dev/loop2 0

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DM_DEV_DIR
              The  device  directory name.  Defaults to "/dev" and must be an
              absolute path.

       DM_UDEV_COOKIE
              A cookie to use for all relevant commands to  synchronize  with
              udev  processing.   It  is an alternative to using --udevcookie
              option.

       DM_DEFAULT_NAME_MANGLING_MODE
              A default mangling mode. Defaults to "auto" and it is an alter‐
              native to using --manglename option.
