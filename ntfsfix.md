NTFSFIX(8)                 System Manager's Manual                 NTFSFIX(8)

NAME
       ntfsfix - fix common errors and force Windows to check NTFS

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsfix [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsfix is a utility that fixes some common NTFS problems.  ntfsfix is
       NOT a Linux version of chkdsk.  It only repairs some fundamental  NTFS
       inconsistencies,  resets  the  NTFS journal file and schedules an NTFS
       consistency check for the first boot into Windows.

       You may run ntfsfix on an NTFS volume if you think it was  damaged  by
       Windows or some other way and it cannot be mounted.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary of all the options that ntfsfix accepts.  Nearly
       all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded  by
       -  and  the  long  name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options,
       that don't take an argument, can be combined into  a  single  command,
       e.g.   -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbrevi‐
       ated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -b, --clear-bad-sectors
              Clear the list of bad sectors. This is useful after cloning  an
              old disk with bad sectors to a new disk.

       -d, --clear-dirty
              Clear  the  volume  dirty  flag  if the volume can be fixed and
              mounted.  If the option is not present or the volume cannot  be
              fixed,  the dirty volume flag is set to request a volume check‐
              ing at next mount.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -n, --no-action
              Do not write anything, just show what would have been done.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license
