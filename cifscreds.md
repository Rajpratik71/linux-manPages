NAME
       cifscreds - manage NTLM credentials in kernel keyring

SYNOPSIS
          cifscreds add|clear|clearall|update [-u username] [-d] host|domain

DESCRIPTION
       The  cifscreds  program is a tool for managing credentials (username and password) for the pur‐
       pose of establishing sessions in multiuser mounts.

       When a cifs filesystem is mounted with the "multiuser" option, and does not use krb5  authenti‐
       cation,  it needs to be able to get the credentials for each user from somewhere. The cifscreds
       program is the tool used to provide these credentials to the kernel.

       The first non-option argument to cifscreds is a command (see the COMMANDS  section below).  The
       second non-option argument is a hostname or address, or an NT domain name.

COMMANDS
       add    Add  credentials to the kernel to be used for connecting to the given server, or servers
              in the given domain.

       clear  Clear credentials for a particular host or domain from the kernel.

       clearall
              Clear all cifs credentials from the kernel.

       update Update stored credentials in the kernel with a new username and password.

OPTIONS
       -d, --domain
              The provided host/domain argument is a NT domainname.

              Ordinarily the second argument provided to cifscreds is treated as a hostname or IP  ad‐
              dress.  This option causes the cifscreds program to treat that argument as an NT domain‐
              name instead.

              If there are not host specific credentials for the mounted server, then the kernel  will
              next  look  for a set of domain credentials equivalent to the domain= option provided at
              mount time.

       -u, --username
              Ordinarily, the username is derived from the unix username of the user adding  the  cre‐
              dentials. This option allows the user to substitute a different username.

NOTES
       The  cifscreds  utility  requires  a kernel built with support for the login key type. That key
       type was added in v3.3 in mainline Linux kernels.

       Since cifscreds adds keys to the session  keyring,  it  is  highly  recommended  that  one  use
       pam_keyinit to ensure that a session keyring is established at login time.
