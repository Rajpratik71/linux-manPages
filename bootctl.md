BOOTCTL(1)                                                                                      bootctl                                                                                     BOOTCTL(1)

NAME
       bootctl - Control the firmware and boot manager settings

SYNOPSIS
       bootctl [OPTIONS...] status

       bootctl [OPTIONS...] list

       bootctl [OPTIONS...] update

       bootctl [OPTIONS...] install

       bootctl [OPTIONS...] remove

DESCRIPTION
       bootctl checks, updates, installs or removes the boot loader from the current system.

       bootctl status checks and prints the currently installed versions of the boot loader binaries and all current EFI boot variables.

       bootctl list displays all configured boot loader entries.

       bootctl update updates all installed versions of systemd-boot, if the current version is newer than the version installed in the EFI system partition. This also includes the EFI
       default/fallback loader at /EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. A systemd-boot entry in the EFI boot variables is created if there is no current entry. The created entry will be added to the end of the boot
       order list.

       bootctl install installs systemd-boot into the EFI system partition. A copy of systemd-boot will be stored as the EFI default/fallback loader at /EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. A systemd-boot entry in
       the EFI boot variables is created and added to the top of the boot order list.

       bootctl remove removes all installed versions of systemd-boot from the EFI system partition, and removes systemd-boot from the EFI boot variables.

       If no command is passed, status is implied.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --path=
           Path to the EFI System Partition (ESP). If not specified, /efi, /boot, and /boot/efi are checked in turn. It is recommended to mount the ESP to /boot, if possible.

       -p, --print-path
           This option modifies the behaviour of status. Just print the path to the EFI System Partition (ESP) to standard output and exit.

       --no-variables
           Do not touch the EFI boot variables.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
