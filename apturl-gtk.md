APTURL(8)                  System Manager's Manual                  APTURL(8)

NAME
       apturl - graphical apt-protocol interpreting package installer

SYNOPSIS
       apturl [options...] <URL>

DESCRIPTION
       apturl  is a simple graphical application that takes an URL (following
       the apt-protocol) as a command line option, parses it and carries  out
       the operations that the URL describes (that is, it asks the user if he
       wants the indicated packages to be installed and if the answer is pos‐
       itive does so).

USAGE
       apturl  just needs an URL conforming with the apt-protocol in order to
       work. Additionally, it recognizes the following options:

       -p, --http-proxy
              Use the given HTTP proxy in order to download the packages.

EXAMPLES
       apturl apt:pidgin,pidgin-plugin-pack
              Installs Pidgin and Pidgin Plugin Pack (if the user confirms).

       apturl apt:freevial?section=universe
              Enables the "universe" component and installs package Freevial.

       apturl apt:adobe-flashplugin?channel=lucid-partner
              Enables the "partner" repository and  installs  package  adobe-
              flashplugin.     Available    repositories    are   listed   in
              /usr/share/app-install/channels/.

       apturl apt+http://launchpad.net/~mvo/ppa?package=2vcard
              Installs 2vcard from the indicated PPA (if the user  confirms),
              and  afterward  asks  if  the PPA should be removed again or it
              should remain enabled.
              Warning: This is currently disabled because  of  security  con‐
              cerns.

EXIT CODES
       0      All requested packages have been successfully installed or were
              already installed.

       1      The user aborted the installation of one or more packages.

       2      There was an error doing the requested operations, or the  user
              aborted the installation while Synaptic (and not apturl itself)
              was working.

       3      The arguments with  which  apturl  was  called  were  incorrect
              (e.g.,  it was called without any argument or the given URL was
              wrong).
