NAME
       goldeneye - HTTP DoS test tool

SYNOPSIS
       goldeneye <URL> [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       GoldenEye  is a HTTP DoS Test Tool. This tool can be used to test if a site is susceptible to Deny of Service (DoS) attacks. Is possible to
       open several parallel connections against a URL to check if the web server can be compromised.

       The program tests the security in networks and uses 'HTTP Keep Alive + NoCache' as attack vector.

OPTIONS
       -u, --useragents
              File with user-agents to use. Default: randomly generated. On Debian systems, there are lists of user-agents  at  /usr/share/golden‚Äê
              eye/useragents/ directory.

       -w, --workers
              Number of concurrent workers. Default: 10.

       -s, --sockets
              Number of concurrent sockets. Default: 500.

       -m, --method
              HTTP method to use. Values: 'get', 'post' and 'random'. Default: get.

       -d, --debug
              Enable debug mode [more verbose output].

       -h, --help
              Show this help.

NOTES
       GoldenEye can create several concurrent workers and it can use all local resources.  Choose good parameters to avoid local problems.
