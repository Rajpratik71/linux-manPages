DESCRIPTION
       xdg-screensaver provides commands to control the screensaver.

       xdg-screensaver is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-screensaver as root.

COMMANDS
       suspend WindowID
           Suspends the screensaver and monitor power management.  WindowID must be the X Window ID of an existing window of the calling application. The window must remain in existence for the
           duration of the suspension.

           WindowID can be represented as either a decimal number or as a hexadecimal number consisting of the prefix 0x followed by one or more hexadecimal digits.

           The screensaver can be suspended in relation to multiple windows at the same time. In that case screensaver operation is only restored once the screensaver has been resumed in relation to
           each of the windows

       resume WindowID
           Resume the screensaver and monitor power management after being suspended.  WindowID must be the same X Window ID that was passed to a previous call of xdg-screensaver suspend

       activate
           Turns the screensaver on immediately. This may result in the screen getting locked, depending on existing system policies.

       lock
           Lock the screen immediately.

       reset
           Turns the screensaver off immediately. If the screen was locked the user may be asked to authenticate first.

       status
           Prints enabled to stdout if the screensaver is enabled to turn on after a period of inactivity and prints disabled if the screensaver is not enabled.
