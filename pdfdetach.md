NAME
       pdfdetach  -  Portable  Document  Format  (PDF) document embedded file
       extractor (version 3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfdetach [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfdetach lists or extracts embedded files (attachments) from a Porta‐
       ble Document Format (PDF) file.

OPTIONS
       Some  of the following options can be set with configuration file com‐
       mands.  These are listed in square brackets with  the  description  of
       the corresponding command line option.

       -list  List all of the embedded files in the PDF file.  File names are
              converted to the text encoding specified by the "-enc" switch.

       -save number
              Save the specified embedded file.  By default,  this  uses  the
              file  name associated with the embedded file (as printed by the
              "-list" switch); the file name can be  changed  with  the  "-o"
              switch.

       -saveall
              Save all of the embedded files.  This uses the file names asso‐
              ciated with the embedded  files  (as  printed  by  the  "-list"
              switch).  By default, the files are saved in the current direc‐
              tory; this can be changed with the "-o" switch.

       -o path
              Set the file name used when saving an embedded  file  with  the
              "-save" switch, or the directory used by "-saveall".

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for text output (embedded file names).
              This defaults to "UTF-8".

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF  file.   Providing  this
              will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
