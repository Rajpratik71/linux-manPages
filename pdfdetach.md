NAME
       pdfdetach - Portable Document Format (PDF) document embedded file extractor (version 3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfdetach [options] [PDF-file]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfdetach lists or extracts embedded files (attachments) from a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.

OPTIONS
       Some of the following options can be set with configuration file commands.  These are listed in square brackets with the description of the
       corresponding command line option.

       -list  List all of the embedded files in the PDF file.  File names are converted to the text encoding specified by the "-enc" switch.

       -save number
              Save the specified embedded file.  By default, this uses the file name associated with the embedded file (as printed by the  "-list"
              switch); the file name can be changed with the "-o" switch.

       -saveall
              Save all of the embedded files.  This uses the file names associated with the embedded files (as printed by the "-list" switch).  By
              default, the files are saved in the current directory; this can be changed with the "-o" switch.

       -o path
              Set the file name used when saving an embedded file with the "-save" switch, or the directory used by "-saveall".

       -enc encoding-name
              Sets the encoding to use for text output (embedded file names).  This defaults to "UTF-8".

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
