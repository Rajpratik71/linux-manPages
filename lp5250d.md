NAME
       lp5250d - start an AS/400 printer session

SYNOPSIS
       lp5250d [OPTIONS] HOSTNAME

DESCRIPTION
       lp5250d  connects  to  an  AS/400  over TCP/IP and provides a printer session emulating an IBM 3812 printer.  The printer session works with scs2ascii and host print transform on the AS/400 to print
       AS/400 spooled files on a local printer.

       To end a printer session, send it a SIGTERM signal with kill(1).

       Printing support requires named session support, which is available for most recent versions of OS/400, but is only supplied with V4R3 and later versions.  For V3R2, V3R7, V4R1 and V4R2, please  see
       informational APAR II10918.

OPTIONS
       Additional lp5250d options are described in the tn5250rc(5) man page.

       -u, --user=USER
              run lp5250d as USER

       -H, --help
              display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       lp5250d env.DEVNAME=LINPRT1 env.IBMMFRTYPMDL='*HP4' as400sys
              Connect to as400sys as the printer LINPRT1, using host print transform on the AS/400 to print to an HP Laserjet or compatible using lpr.

       lp5250d env.DEVNAME=LINPRT1 env.IBMMFRTYPMDL='*OKI184IBM' outputcommand=''scs2ascii | lpr -Poki' as400sys
              Print to an Okidata Microline 184 Turbo on the local print queue named `oki'.

       lp5250d env.DEVNAME=PSPRT outputcommand='scs2ps > scs$$.ps' as400sys
              Convert spooled files into PostScriptÂ® files.
