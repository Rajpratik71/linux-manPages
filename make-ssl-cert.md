NAME
       make-ssl-cert - Debconf wrapper for openssl

SYNOPSIS
       make-ssl-cert template output-certificate [--force-overwrite]
       make-ssl-cert generate-default-snakeoil [--force-overwrite]

DESCRIPTION
       make-ssl-cert  is  a simple debconf to openssl wrapper to create self-signed certificates.  It requires a source template (Ex: /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf) and it will place the new gener‚Äê
       ated certificate in the specified output file.
       Invoked with "generate-default-snakeoil", it will generate /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem and /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       --force-overwrite
              Use this option ONLY when strictly required since it will overwrite the output certificate.
