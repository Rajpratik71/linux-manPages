DESCRIPTION
       efibootmgr is a userspace application used to modify the Intel Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) Boot Manager.  This application can cre‐
       ate and destroy boot entries, change the boot order, change the next running boot option, and more.

       Details on the EFI Boot Manager are available from the EFI Specification, v1.02 or later, available from:
        <URL:http://developer.intel.com>

              Note: efibootmgr requires  that  the  kernel  support  access  to  EFI  non-volatile  variables  through  /sys/firmware/efi/vars  or
              /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/.

OPTIONS
       The following is a list of options accepted by efibootmgr:

       -a | --active
              Sets bootnum active

       -A | --inactive
              Sets bootnum inactive

       -b | --bootnum XXXX
              Modify BootXXXX (hex)

       -B | --delete-bootnum
              Delete bootnum (hex)

       -c | --create
              Create new variable bootnum and add to bootorder

       -d | --disk DISK
              The disk containing the loader (defaults to /dev/sda)

       -D | --remove-dups
              Remove duplicated entries from BootOrder

       -e | --edd30 1|3|-1
              Force EDD 1.0 or 3.0 creation variables, or guess.

       -E | --edd-device NUM
              EDD 1.0 device number (defaults to 0x80)

       -g | --gpt
              Force disk with invalid PMBR to be treated as GPT

       -i | --iface NAME
              create a netboot entry for the named interface

       -l | --loader NAME
              Specify a loader (defaults to \\elilo.efi)

       -L | --label LABEL
              Boot manager display label (defaults to "Linux")

       -n | --bootnext XXXX
              Set BootNext to XXXX (hex)

       -N | --delete-bootnext
              Delete BootNext

       -o | --bootorder XXXX,YYYY,ZZZZ
              Explicitly  set  BootOrder  (hex).  Any value from 0 to FFFF is accepted so long as it corresponds to an existing Boot#### variable,
              and zero padding is not required.

       -O | --delete-bootorder
              Delete BootOrder

       -p | --part PART
              Partition number containing the bootloader (defaults to 1)

       -q | --quiet
              Quiet mode - supresses output.

       -t | --timeout seconds
              Boot Manager timeout, in seconds.

       -T | --delete-timeout
              Delete Timeout variable.

       -u | --unicode | --UCS-2
              pass extra command line arguments as UCS-2 (default is ASCII)

       -v | --verbose
              Verbose mode - prints additional information

       -V | --version
              Just print version string and exit.

       -w | --write-signature
              write unique signature to the MBR if needed

       -@ | --append-binary-args
              append extra variable args from file (use - to read from stdin).  Data in file is appended as command line  arguments  to  the  boot
              loader command, with no modification to the data, so you can pass any binary or text data necessary.

EXAMPLES
       1.

   DISPLAYING THE CURRENT SETTINGS (MUST BE ROOT).
       [root@localhost ~]# efibootmgr
       BootCurrent: 0004
       BootNext: 0003
       BootOrder: 0004,0000,0001,0002,0003
       Timeout: 30 seconds
       Boot0000* Diskette Drive(device:0)
       Boot0001* CD-ROM Drive(device:FF)
       Boot0002* Hard Drive(Device:80)/HD(Part1,Sig00112233)
       Boot0003* PXE Boot: MAC(00D0B7C15D91)
       Boot0004* Linux

       This shows:

              · BootCurrent - the boot entry used to start the currently running system

              · BootOrder  -  the  boot  order as would appear in the boot manager.  The boot manager tries to boot the first active entry in this
                list.  If unsuccessful, it tries the next entry, and so on.

              · BootNext - the boot entry which is scheduled to be run on next boot.  This supercedes BootOrder for one boot only, and is  deleted
                by the boot manager after first use.  This allows you to change the next boot behavior without changing BootOrder.

              · Timeout  - the time in seconds between when the boot manager appears on the screen until when it automatically chooses the startup
                value from BootNext or BootOrder.

              · Five boot entries (0000 - 0004), along with the active/inactive flag (* means active) and the name displayed on the screen.

       2.

   CREATING A NEW BOOT OPTION
       An OS installer would call efibootmgr -c.  This assumes that /boot/efi is your EFI System Partition, and is  mounted  at  /dev/sda1.   This
       creates  a  new  boot  option,  called "Linux", and puts it at the top of the boot order list.  Options may be passed to modify the default
       behavior.  The default OS Loader is elilo.efi.

       3.

   CHANGING THE BOOT ORDER
       Assuming the configuration in Example #1, efibootmgr -o 3,4 could be called to specify PXE boot first, then Linux boot.

       4.

   CHANGING THE BOOT ORDER FOR THE NEXT BOOT ONLY
       Assuming the configuration in Example #1, efibootmgr -n 4 could be called to specify that the Linux entry be taken on next boot.

       5.

   DELETING A BOOT OPTION
       Assuming the configuration in Example #1, efibootmgr -b 4 -B could be called to delete entry 4 and remove it from the BootOrder.

       6.

   CREATING NETWORK BOOT ENTRIES
       A system administrator wants to create a boot option to network boot.  You create the boot entry with: efibootmgr -c -i eth0 -L  netboot  [
       -l '\filename.efi' ]
