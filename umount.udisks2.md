NAME
       umount.udisks2 - unmount file systems that have been mounted by UDisks2

DESCRIPTION

       automatically created directories created at file system mount-time. It should never be called
       directly.

AUTHOR
       This man page was originally written for UDisks2 by David Zeuthen <zeuthen@gmail.com> with a
       lot of help from many others.
