NAME
       mmroff - cross reference preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       mmroff [ -x ] groff_arguments

DESCRIPTION
       mmroff  is  a  simple  preprocessor  for groff, it is used for expanding cross references in mm, see groff_mm(7).  groff is executed twice,
       first with -z and -rRef=1 to collect all cross references and then to do the real processing when the cross reference file is up to date.

       -x     Just create the cross reference file.  This can be used to refresh the cross reference file, it isn't always needed to have accurate
              cross references and by using this option groff will only be run once.
