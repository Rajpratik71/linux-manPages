DESCRIPTION
       cdrdao creates audio and data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a description file called toc-file.  In DAO mode it is possible to create non standard track pre-gaps that have other lengths
       than 2 seconds and contain nonzero audio data. This is for example useful to divide live recordings into tracks where 2 second gaps would be kind of irritating.

       Instead of a toc-file a cue file (used by a famous DOS/Windows mastering tool) may be used. See the CUE FILES section for more details.


COMMANDS
       The first argument must be one of the following commands:

       show-toc
              Print out a summary about what will be written to the CD-R.

       toc-info
              Prints out short toc-file summary.

       toc-size
              Prints total number of blocks for toc.

       read-toc
              Analyze each track of the inserted CD and create a toc-file that can be used to make a more or less exact copy of the CD.  This command does not read out the audio or data tracks, use read-cd
              for this purpose.

              You can specify a filename for the data file via the --datafile option.

       read-cd
              Copies all tracks of the inserted CD to an image file and creates a corresponding toc-file.  The name of the image file defaults to "data.bin" if no --datafile option is given.

       read-cddb
              Tries to retrieve title and artist data from a CDDB server for the CD represented by the given toc-file. The retrieved data is added as CD-TEXT data for language 0 to the  toc-file.  Existing
              CD-TEXT data for language 0 will be overwritten.

       show-data
              Print  out  all samples that would be written to the CD-R. Each line contains the sample number (starting at 0) and the decimal sample value for the left and right channel. Useful to check if
              the byte order of audio files is correct.

       read-test
              Check if all data can be read from the audio files that are defined in the toc-file.  This will also check the communication with the slave process that is responsible for writing  the  audio
              data to the CD-recorder. Mainly used for testing.

       disk-info
              Shows  information about the inserted CD-R. If the CD-R has an open session it will also print the start of the last and current session which is used by mkisofs to create an image for a sec‚Äê
              ond or higher session.

       discid Prints out CDDB information.

       msinfo Shows information required for creating multi session disks with mkisofs. The output is meant for processing by scripts.

       drive-info
              Shows drive information.

       unlock Tries to unlock the recorder device after a failed write or simulation run. If you cannot eject the CD after a cdrdao run try this command.

       blank  Blanks a CD-RW. The CD-RW is minimally blanked by default. Use option --blank-mode to select another blanking mode.  Sometimes the blanking speed must be manually  reduced  for  a  successful
              blanking operation. Use option --speed to select another blanking speed.

       scanbus
              Scan for devices.

       simulate
              Like write but laser stays cold. It is a shortcut for write --simulate.

       write  Write the CD-R according to the specifications in the toc-file.

       copy   Performs  all  steps  to copy a CD. The device containing the source CD must be specified with option --source-device and the recorder device with option --device.  If only a single device is
              available the option --source-device must be omitted and cdrdao will prompt to insert the CD-R after an image of the source CD was created.

              The image file with name "cddata<pid>.bin" will be created in the current working directory if no --datafile option is given. The created image will be removed after it has been written.

              If option --on-the-fly is given no image file is created and the data will be directly piped from the reading device to the CD recorder.



OPTIONS
       --device [prot:]bus,id,lun
              Sets the SCSI address of the CD-recorder in form of a bus/id/lun triple, e.g. '0,2,0' for the logical unit 0 of SCSI device with ID 2 on bus 0. ATAPI devices can be  specified  by  using  the
              prefix 'ATAPI:', e.g. 'ATAPI:0,0,0'. On some systems a device node may be specified directly, e.g. '/dev/sg0' on Linux systems. Linux 2.6 users may also try the newer ATAPI interface with the
              'ATA:' prefix.

       --source-device [prot:]bus,id,lun
              Like above but used for the copy command to specify the source device.

       --driver driver-id:option-flags
              Force usage of specified driver instead of the automatically determined driver. Available driver IDs:
              cdd2600, plextor, plextor-scan, generic-mmc, generic-mmc-raw, ricoh-mp6200, yamaha-cdr10x, teac-cdr55, sony-cdu920, sony-cdu948, taiyo-yuden, toshiba.
              Specifying an illegal driver ID will give a list of available drivers.  Option flags may be used to modify the behavior of some drivers. See README for details.

       --source-driver driver-id:option-flags
              Like above but used for the device specified with option --source-device.

       --speed value
              Set the writing speed to value.  Default is the highest possible speed.

       --blank-mode mode
              Sets the blanking mode. Available modes are full and minimal.  Please consider that the data of minimally blanked disks may be easily recovered. Use the  full  blanking  mode  for  completely
              erasing all data. The default blanking mode is minimal.

       --datafile file
              Used  for  read-toc,  read-cd  and copy.  Set the default data file placed in the toc-file by read-toc.  Use "-" to indicate STDIN.  For commands read-cd and copy it specifies the name of the
              created image file.

       --read-raw
              Only used for commands read-cd and read-toc.  All data sectors will be written as 2352 byte blocks including the sector header and L-EC data to the image file. The track mode will be  set  to
              MODE1_RAW or MODE2_RAW in the created toc-file.

       --read-subchan mode
              Used by commands read-cd, read-toc and copy.  Specifies the type of sub-channel data that is extracted from the source CD and written to the track image or copied to the destination CD.  Mode
              may be rw for reading packed R-W sub-channel data (de-interleaved and error corrected) and rw_raw for reading raw R-W sub-channel data (not de-interleaved,  not  error  corrected,  L-EC  data
              included in the track image).  If this option is not specified no sub-channel data will be extracted.

       --no-mode2-mixed
              Only used for commands read-cd and read-toc.  If we have MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2, don't extract it as MODE2_FORM_MIX.  toc-file.

       --tao-source
              This  option indicates to the commands read-toc and read-cd that the source CD was written in TAO mode. It will be assumed that the pre-gap length between all tracks (except between two audio
              tracks) is the standard 150 blocks plus the number of link blocks (usually 2). The number of link blocks can be controlled with option --tao-source-adjust.

              Use this option only if read-toc or read-cd give error messages in the transition areas between two tracks. If you use this option with pressed CDs or CDs written in DAO  mode  you  will  get
              wrong results.

       --tao-source-adjust link-blocks
              Specifies the number of link blocks for tracks written in TAO mode. This option has only an effect if option --tao-source is given.

       --fast-toc
              Only used for command read-toc.  This option suppresses the pre-gap length and index mark extraction which speeds up the read-toc process. Standard 2 second pre-gaps (but no silence!) will be
              placed into the toc-file. The resulting CD will sound like the source CD. Only the CD player's display will behave slightly different in the transition area between two tracks.

              This option might help, too, if read-toc fails with your drive otherwise.


       --buffers buffer-count
              Specifies the number of buffers that are allocated to avoid buffer under runs.  The minimal buffer count is fixed to 10, default is 32 except on FreeBSD systems, on which default is 20.  Each
              buffer holds 1 second of audio data so that dividing buffer-count by the writing speed gives the maximum time for which reading of audio data may be stalled.

       --multi
              If this option is given the session will not be closed after the audio data is successfully written. It is possible to append another session on such disks, e.g. to create a CD-EXTRA.

       --overburn
              By default cdrdao will not allow to write more data on a medium than specified by the current medium. This option allows to ignore this condition.

       --eject
              Eject the CD-R after writing or write simulation.

       --swap Swap the byte order of all samples that are send to the CD-recorder.

       --session session-nr
              Used for read-toc and read-cd to specify the session which should be processed on multi session CDs.

       --reload
              Indicates that the tray may be opened before writing without prompting the user to reset the disk status after a simulation run.

       --force
              Forces the execution of an operation that otherwise would not be performed.

       --paranoia-mode mode
              Sets  the  correction  mode  for digital audio extraction. 0: No checking, data is copied directly from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to avoid jitter. 2: Like 1 but with additional
              checks of the read audio data. 3: Like 2 but with additional scratch detection and repair.

              The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.

              Default is the full paranoia mode (3).

       --keepimage
              If a CD is copied with command copy this option will cause that the created image is not removed after the copy process has finished.

       --on-the-fly
              Perform CD copy on the fly without creating an image file.

       --with-cddb
              Enables the automatic fetching of CDDB data for use as CD-TEXT data for commands copy, read-toc and read-cd.

       --cddb-servers server-list
              Sets space or ',' separated list of CDDB servers used for command read-cddb or for commands where the --with-cddb option is active.  A server entry may have the following forms:

       <server>
              Connect to <server>, default cddbp port (888), use cddbp protocol.

       <server>:<port>
              Connect to <server>, port <port>, use cddbp protocol.

       <server>:<cgi-bin-path>
              Connect to <server>, default http port (80), use http protocol, url: <cgi-bin-path>.

       <server>:<port>:<cgi-bin-path>
              Connect to <server>, port <port>, use http protocol, url: <cgi-bin-path>.

       <server>:<port>:<cgi-bin-path>:<proxy-server>
              Connect to <proxy-server>, default http port (80), use http protocol, url: http://<server>:<port>/<cgi-bin-path>.

       <server>:<port>:<cgi-bin-path>:<proxy-server>:<proxy-port>
              Connect to <proxy-server>, port <proxy-port>, use http protocol, url: http://<server>:<port>/<cgi-bin-path>.

              The <cgi-bin-path> is usually "/~cddb/cddb.cgi".

              All servers of the server list will be tried in the given order until a successful connection can be established. For http proxy servers the first successful connected http proxy server  will
              be used independent of the ability to connect to the target http server.

              Example: freedb.freedb.org:/~cddb/cddb.cgi

       --cddb-timeout timeout
              Sets the timeout in seconds used for connections to CDDB servers.

       --cddb-directory directory
              Specifies the local CDDB database directory where fetched CDDB records will be stored. If this option is not given a fetched CDDB record will not be stored locally.

       --tmpdir directory
              Specifies the directory in which to store temporary data files created from decoding MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files. By default, "/tmp" is used.

       --keep Upon exit from cdrdao, do not delete temporary WAV files created from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.

       --save Saves some of the current options to the settings file "$HOME/.cdrdao" and exit. See section ¬¥SETTINGS¬¥ for more details.

       -n     Suppresses the 10 second pause before writing or simulating.

       -v verbose-level
              Sets verbose level. Levels > 2 are debug levels which produce a lot of output.


TOC FILES
       The  toc-file  describes what data is written to the CD-R and allows control over track/index positions, pre-gaps and sub-channel information. It is a simple text file, use your favorite text editor
       to create it.

       A toc-file contains an optional header and a sequence of track specifications. Comments starting with '//' reaching until end of line can be placed anywhere.


   Header
       CATALOG "ddddddddddddd"
              Specifies the optional catalog number of the CD. The string must contain exactly 13 digits.

       The following flags specify the type of session that will be created. It is used to create the correct CD-TOC format and to check the consistency of the track modes for the desired session type.  If
       multiple flags are given the last one will take effect.

       CD_DA  The disc contains only audio tracks.

       CD_ROM The disc contains just mode 1 tracks or mode 1 and audio tracks (mixed mode CD).

       CD_ROM_XA
              The disc contains mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form 2 tracks. Audio tracks are allowed, too. This type must be used if multi session disks are created (option --multi).

       CD_TEXT { ... }
              Defines global CD-TEXT data like the album title and the used languages.  See the CD-TEXT section below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.

   Track Specification
       TRACK <track-mode> [<sub-channel-mode>]
              Starts  a  new track, the track number is incremented by 1. The length of a track must be at least 4 seconds. The block length of the input data depends on the <track-mode>: AUDIO: 2352 bytes
              (588 samples), MODE1: 2048 bytes, MODE1_RAW: 2352 bytes, MODE2: 2336 bytes, MODE2_FORM1: 2048 bytes, MODE2_FORM2: 2324 bytes, MODE2_FORM_MIX: 2336 bytes including the  sub-header,  MODE2_RAW:
              2352  bytes.  The <sub-channel-mode> is optional. If given it specifies the type of sub-channel data for each sector. RW: packed R-W sub-channel data (96 bytes, L-EC data will be generated if
              required), RW_RAW: raw R-W sub-channel data (interleaved and L-EC data already calculated, 96 bytes). The block length is increased by the sub-channel data length if a  <sub-channel-mode>  is
              specified.  If the input data length is not a multiple of the block length  it will be padded with zeros.

       The  following  flags  may  follow the track start statement. They are used to set sub-channel information for the current track. Each flag is optional. If not given the following defaults are used:
       copy not permitted, no pre emphasis, two channel audio, no ISRC code.

       [ NO ] COPY
              Sets or clears the copy permitted flag.

       [ NO ] PRE_EMPHASIS
              Sets or clears the pre emphasis flag (only for audio tracks).

       TWO_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates that track contains two channel audio data (only for audio tracks).

       FOUR_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates that track contains four channel audio data (only for audio tracks).

       ISRC "CCOOOYYSSSSS"
              Sets ISRC code of track (only for audio tracks).
              C: country code (upper case letters or digits)
              O: owner code (upper case letters or digits)
              Y: year (digits)
              S: serial number (digits)

       An optional CD-TEXT block that defines the CD-TEXT data for this track may follow. See the CD-TEXT section below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.

       CD_TEXT { ... }

       At least one of the following statements must appear to specify the data for the current track. Lengths and start positions may be expressed in samples (1/44100 seconds) for audio tracks or in bytes
       for data tracks. It is also possible to give the length in blocks with the MSF format 'MM:SS:FF' specifying minutes, seconds and frames (0 <= 'FF' < 75) . A frame equals one block.

       If more than one statement is used the track will be composed by concatenating the data in the specified order.

       SILENCE <length>
              Adds zero audio data of specified length to the current audio track.  Useful to create silent pre-gaps.

       ZERO <length>
              Adds zero data to data tracks. Must be used to define pre- or post-gaps between tracks of different mode.

       [ FILE | AUDIOFILE ] "<filename>" <start> [ <length> ]
              Adds the audio data of specified file to the current audio track. It is possible to select a portion of an audio file with <start> and <length> which allows non destructive cutting. The first
              sample of an audio file is addressed with <start> = 0. If <length> is omitted or set to 0 all audio data from <start> until the end of file is used.

              Audio files may have raw or WAVE format with 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling rate, stereo. Raw files must have the layout 'MSBLeft  LSBLeft  MSBRight  LSBRight  ...'  (big  endian  byte
              order).  WAVE  files  are  expected  to  have  little endian byte order. The option --swap reverses the expected byte order for all raw and WAVE files. Only filenames with a ".wav" ending are
              treated as WAVE files, all other names are assumed to be raw audio files. Use tools like sox(1) to convert other file formats to supported formats.

              Specifying a "-" as filename causes data to be read from STDIN. Currently only raw files are supported from STDIN.

              If you are unsure about the byte order of your audio files try the command 'show-data'. If the byte order is correct you will see a sequence of increasing or decreasing numbers for both chan‚Äê
              nels. Otherwise numbers are jumping between very high and low values - high volume static.

       DATAFILE "<filename>" [ <length> ]
              Adds data from given file to the current data track. If <length> is omitted the actual file length will be used.

       FIFO "<fifo path>" <length>
              Adds data from specified FIFO path to the current audio or data track.  <length> must specify the amount of data that will be read from the FIFO. The value is always in terms of bytes (scalar
              value) or in terms of the block length (MSF value).

       START [ MM:SS:FF ]
              Defines the length of the pre-gap (position where index switches from 0 to 1). If the MSF value is omitted the current track length is used. If the current track length is not a  multiple  of
              the block length the pre-gap length will be rounded up to next block boundary.

              If no START statement is given the track will not have a pre-gap.

       PREGAP MM:SS:FF
              This  is an alternate way to specify a pre-gap with zero audio data. It may appear before the first SILENCE, ZERO or FILE statement. Either PREGAP or START can be used within a track specifi‚Äê
              cation. It is equivalent to the sequence
                SILENCE MM:SS:FF
                START
              for audio tracks or
                ZERO MM:SS:FF
                START
              for data tracks.

       Nothing prevents mixing 'DATAFILE'/'ZERO' and 'AUDIOFILE'/'SILENCE' statements within the same track. The results, however, are undefined.


       The end of a track specification may contain zero or more index increment statements:

       INDEX MM:SS:FF
              Increments the index number at given position within the track. The first statement will increment from 1 to 2. The position is relative to the real track start, not counting an existing pre-
              gap.


   CD-TEXT Blocks
       A  CD-TEXT  block may be placed in the global section to define data valid for the whole CD and in each track specification of a toc-file.  The global section must define a language map that is used
       to map a language-number to country codes. Up to 8 different languages can be defined:

       LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : c1  1 : c2  ...  7 : c7 }
              The country code may be an integer value in the range 0..255 or one of the following countries (the corresponding integer value is placed in braces behind the token): EN(9, English)
              It is just necessary to define a mapping for the used languages.

       If no mapping exists for a language-number the data for this language will be ignored.

       For each language a language block must exist that defines the actual data for a certain language.

       LANGUAGE language-number { cd-text-item cd-text-data cd-text-item cd-text-data ... }
              Defines the CD-TEXT items for given language-number which must be defined in the language map.

       The cd-text-data may be either a string enclosed by " or binary data like
            { 0, 10, 255, ... }
       where each integer number must be in the range 0..255.
       The cd-text-item may be one of the following:

       TITLE  String data: Title of CD or track.

       PERFORMER
              String data.

       SONGWRITER
              String data.

       COMPOSER
              String data.

       ARRANGER
              String data.

       MESSAGE
              String data. Message to the user.

       DISC_ID
              String data: Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. The format is usually: XY12345

       GENRE  Mixture of binary data (genre code) and string data. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Useful entries will be created by gcdmaster.

       TOC_INFO1
              Binary data: Optional table of contents 1. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.

       TOC_INFO2
              Binary data: Optional table of contents 2. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.

       UPC_EAN
              String data: This item should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Was always an empty string on the CD-TEXT CDs I had access to.

       ISRC   String data: ISRC code of track. The format is usually: CC-OOO-YY-SSSSS

       SIZE_INFO
              Binary data: Contains summary about all CD-TEXT data and should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. The data will be automatically (re)created when the CD-TEXT data is written.

              If one of the CD-TEXT items TITLE, PERFORMER, SONGWRITER, COMPOSER, ARRANGER, ISRC is defined for at least on track or in the global section it must be defined  for  all  tracks  and  in  the
              global section. If a DISC_ID item is defined in the global section, an ISRC entry must be defined for each track.


   Examples
       Simple track without pre-gap with all audio data from WAVE file "data.wav":
            CD_DA
            TRACK AUDIO
            FILE "data.wav" 0

       Standard track with two second pre-gap, ISRC code and CD-TEXT:
            CD_DA
            CD_TEXT {
              LANGUAGE_MAP {
                0 : EN
              }

              LANGUAGE 0 {
                TITLE "CD Title"
                PERFORMER "Performer"
                DISC_ID "XY12345"
                UPC_EAN ""
              }
            }

            TRACK AUDIO
            ISRC "DEXXX9800001"
            CD_TEXT {
              LANGUAGE 0 {
                TITLE "Track Title"
                PERFORMER "Performer"
                ISRC "DE-XXX-98-00001"
              }
            }
            PREGAP 0:2:0
            FILE "data.wav" 0

       Track with 10 second pre-gap containing audio data from raw file "data.cdr":
            CD_DA
            TRACK AUDIO
            FILE "data.cdr" 0
            START 0:10:0

       Composed  track  with  data  from different files. Pre-gap data and length is taken from "pregapdata.wav". The first minute of "track.cdr" is omitted and two seconds silence are inserted at '2:0:0'.
       Index will be incremented after 2 and 4 minutes past track start:
            CD_DA
            TRACK AUDIO
            FILE "pregapdata.wav" 0
            START
            FILE "track.cdr" 1:0:0 1:0:0
            SILENCE 0:2:0
            FILE "track.cdr" 2:0:0
            INDEX 2:0:0
            INDEX 4:0:0

       Mixed mode CD with a data track as first track followed by two audio tracks.
            CD_ROM
            TRACK MODE1
            DATAFILE "data_1"
            ZERO 00:02:00 // post-gap

            TRACK AUDIO
            SILENCE 00:02:00 // pre-gap
            START
            FILE "data_2.wav" 0

            TRACK AUDIO
            FILE "data_3.wav" 0


CUE FILES
       Cue files may be used wherever a toc-file is expected. The corresponding bin file is not taken from the FILE statement of a cue file but constructed from the cue file name  by  replacing  ".cue"  by
       ".bin". The cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.

       Currently, following track modes are supported: MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352, MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The CATALOG, ISRC and POSTGAP statements are parsed but not evaluated, yet.


SETTINGS
       Some of the command line options can be stored as settings at following locations. The files will be read on startup of cdrdao in that order:

       1. /etc/cdrdao.conf

       2. /etc/defaults/cdrdao

       3. /etc/default/cdrdao

       4. $HOME/.cdrdao


       Command  line  options will overwrite the loaded settings.  The settings file contains name - value pairs separated by a colon. String values must be enclosed by ". The file is automatically written
       if the command line option --save is used but it is also possible to modify it manually. Following values are defined:

       write_device
              Device used for operations simulate, write, copy, blank, disk-info and unlock.  Corresponding option: --device

       write_driver
              Driver (including driver options) that is used for operations simulate, write, copy, blank, disk-info and unlock.  Corresponding option: --driver

       write_speed
              Specifies writing speed. Corresponding option: --speed

       write_buffers
              Specifies fifo buffers used for recording. Corresponding option: --buffers

       read_device
              Device used for operations read-toc, read-cd and copy.  Corresponding option: --device or --source-device

       read_driver
              Driver (including driver options) used for operations read-toc, read-cd and copy.  Corresponding option: --driver or --source-driver

       read_paranoia_mode
              Paranoia mode used for operations read-cd and copy.  Corresponding option: --paranoia-mode

       cddb_server_list
              CDDB server list for read-cddb.  Corresponding option: --cddb-servers

       cddb_timeout
              CDDB connection timeout in seconds used by read-cddb.  Corresponding option: --cddb-timeout

       cddb_directory
              Local directory where fetched CDDB records will be stored, used by read-cddb.  Corresponding option: --cddb-directory

       tmp_file_dir
              Directory where temporary WAV files will be created from decoding MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files. Corresponding option: --tmpdir

BUGS
       If the program is terminated during the write/simulation process used IPC resources may not be released. Use ipcs(8) and ipcrm(8) to delete them.
