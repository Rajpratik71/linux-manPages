Note of warning
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not
       be entirely accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

Description
       The mshortname command is used to display the short name of a file.  Syntax:

       mshortname files

       The shortname is displayed as it is stored in raw format on disk,  without  any  character  set
       conversion.

Viewing the texi doc
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However,
       this process is only approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and  in‐
       dices  are lost in this translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate represen‐
       tation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has been translated into the  man‐
       page version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this
       manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info

       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain
       examples are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
