AIREPLAY-NG(8)                                                System Manager's Manual                                               AIREPLAY-NG(8)

NAME
       aireplay-ng - inject packets into a wireless network to generate traffic

SYNOPSIS
       aireplay-ng [options] <replay interface>

DESCRIPTION
       aireplay-ng is used to inject/replay frames.  The primary function is to generate traffic for the later use in aircrack-ng for cracking the
       WEP and WPA-PSK keys. There are different attacks which can cause deauthentications for the purpose of capturing WPA handshake  data,  fake
       authentications,  Interactive  packet  replay, hand-crafted ARP request injection and ARP-request reinjection. With the packetforge-ng tool
       it's possible to create arbitrary frames.

       aireplay-ng supports single-NIC injection/monitor.

       This feature needs driver patching.

       ciew.com/2014/10/11/802-11-mgmt-deauth-disassociation-frames/

       Attack modes:

       -0 <count>, --deauth=<count>
              This attack sends deauthentication packets to one or more clients which are currently associated with  a  particular  access  point.
              Deauthenticating  clients can be done for a number of reasons: Recovering a hidden ESSID. This is an ESSID which is not being broad‐
              cast. Another term for this is "cloaked" or Capturing WPA/WPA2 handshakes by forcing  clients  to  reauthenticate  or  Generate  ARP
              requests  (Windows  clients  sometimes flush their ARP cache when disconnected).  Of course, this attack is totally useless if there
              are no associated wireless client or on fake authentications.

       -1 <delay>, --fakeauth=<delay>
              The fake authentication attack allows you to perform the two types of WEP authentication (Open System and Shared Key) plus associate
              with  the access point (AP). This is only useful when you need an associated MAC address in various aireplay-ng attacks and there is
              currently no associated client. It should be noted that the fake authentication attack does  NOT  generate  any  ARP  packets.  Fake
              authentication cannot be used to authenticate/associate with WPA/WPA2 Access Points.

       -2, --interactive
              This  attack  allows  you  to  choose  a specific packet for replaying (injecting). The attack can obtain packets to replay from two
              sources. The first being a live flow of packets from your wireless card. The second being from a pcap file. Reading from a  file  is
              an often overlooked feature of aireplay-ng. This allows you read packets from other capture sessions or quite often, various attacks
              generate pcap files for easy reuse. A common use of reading a file containing a packet your created with packetforge-ng.

       -3, --arpreplay
              The classic ARP request replay attack is the most effective way to generate new initialization vectors (IVs), and works  very  reli‐
              ably.  The program listens for an ARP packet then retransmits it back to the access point. This, in turn, causes the access point to
              repeat the ARP packet with a new IV. The program retransmits the same ARP packet over and over. However, each ARP packet repeated by
              the access point has a new IVs. It is all these new IVs which allow you to determine the WEP key.

       -4, --chopchop
              This  attack,  when  successful,  can  decrypt a WEP data packet without knowing the key. It can even work against dynamic WEP. This
              attack does not recover the WEP key itself, but merely reveals the plaintext. However, some access points are not vulnerable to this
              attack.  Some  may  seem vulnerable at first but actually drop data packets shorter that 60 bytes. If the access point drops packets
              shorter than 42 bytes, aireplay tries to guess the rest of the missing data, as far as the headers are predictable. If an IP  packet
              is  captured,  it  additionally  checks if the checksum of the header is correct after guessing the missing parts of it. This attack
              requires at least one WEP data packet.

       -5, --fragment
              This attack, when successful, can obtain 1500 bytes of PRGA (pseudo random generation algorithm). This attack does not  recover  the
              WEP  key  itself,  but  merely obtains the PRGA. The PRGA can then be used to generate packets with packetforge-ng which are in turn
              used for various injection attacks. It requires at least one data packet to be received from the access point in order  to  initiate
              the attack.

       -6, --caffe-latte
              In  general,  for an attack to work, the attacker has to be in the range of an AP and a connected client (fake or real). Caffe Latte
              attacks allows one to gather enough packets to crack a WEP key without the need of an AP, it just need a client to be in range.

       -7, --cfrag
              This attack turns IP or ARP packets from a client into ARP request against the client. This attack works especially well against ad-
              hoc networks. As well it can be used against softAP clients and normal AP clients.

       -8, --migmode
              This  attack  works  against Cisco Aironet access points configured in WPA Migration Mode, which enables both WPA and WEP clients to
              associate to an access point using the same Service Set Identifier (SSID).  The program listens for a WEP-encapsulated broadcast ARP
              packet,  bitflips  it to make it into an ARP coming from the attacker's MAC address and retransmits it to the access point. This, in
              turn, causes the access point to repeat the ARP packet with a new IV and also to forward the ARP reply to the attacker  with  a  new
              IV. The program retransmits the same ARP packet over and over. However, each ARP packet repeated by the access point has a new IV as
              does the ARP reply forwarded to the attacker by the access point. It is all these new IVs which allow you to determine the WEP key.

       -9, --test
              Tests injection and quality.

FRAGMENTATION VERSUS CHOPCHOP
       Fragmentation:

              Pros
              - Can obtain the full packet length of 1500 bytes XOR. This means you can subsequently pretty well create any size of packet.
              - May work where chopchop does not
              - Is extremely fast. It yields the XOR stream extremely quickly when successful.

              Cons
              - Setup to execute the attack is more subject to the device drivers. For example, Atheros does  not  generate  the  correct  packets
              unless the wireless card is set to the mac address you are spoofing.
              - You need to be physically closer to the access point since if any packets are lost then the attack fails.

       Chopchop

              Pro
              - May work where frag does not work.

              Cons
              - Cannot be used against every access point.
              - The maximum XOR bits is limited to the length of the packet you chopchop against.
              - Much slower then the fragmentation attack.
