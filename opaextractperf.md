NAME
       opaextractperf



       Provides  a  report of all performance counters in a CVS format suitable for importing into a spreadsheet or parsed by other scripts for further analysis. It generates a detailed opareport component
       summary report and pipes the result to opaxmlextract, extracting element values for NodeDesc, SystemImageGUID, PortNum, and all the performance counters. Extraction is performed only from  the  Sys‚Äê
       tems portion of the report, which does not contain Neighbor information (the Neighbor and SMs portions are suppressed).

Syntax
       opaextractperf [opareport options]

Options
       --help    Produces full help text.


       opareport options
                 The following options are passed to opareport. This subset is considered typical and useful for this command. By design, the tool ignores -o/--output report option.




                 -h/--hfi hfi
                           Specifies the HFI, numbered 1..n. Using 0 specifies that the -p port port is a system-wide port number. Default is 0.





                 -p/--port port
                           Specifies the port, numbered 1..n. Using 0 specifies the first active port. Default is 0.





                 -X/--infile snapshot_input
                           Generates a report using the data in the snapshot_input file. snapshot_input must have been generated during a previous -o snapshot run. When used, the -s, -i, -C, and -a options
                           are ignored. '-' may be used as the snapshot_input to specify stdin.





                 -T/--topology topology_input
                           Uses topology_input file to augment and verify fabric information. When used, various reports can be augmented with  information  not  available  electronically  (such  as  cable
                           labels). '-' may be used to specify stdin.





                 -i/--interval seconds
                           Obtains performance statistics over interval seconds. Clears all statistics, waits interval seconds, then generates report. Implies -s option.





                 -b / --begin date_time
                           Obtains  past performance stats over an interval beginning at date_time. Implies -s option. date_time may be a time entered as HH:MM[:SS] or date as mm/dd/YYYY, dd.mm.YYYY, YYYY-
                           mm-dd or date followed by time; for example, "2016-07-04 14:40". Relative times are taken as "x [second|minute|hour|day](s) ago.





                 -e / --end date_time
                           Obtains past performance stats over an interval ending at date_time. Implies -s option.


                           date_time may be a time entered as HH:MM[:SS] or date as mm/dd/YYYY, dd.mm.YYYY, YYYY-mm-dd or date followed by time; for example, "2016-07-04 14:40". Relative times are taken as
                           "x [second|minute|hour|day](s) ago.




                 -C/--clear
                           Clears performance statistics for all ports. Only statistics with error thresholds are cleared. A clear occurs after generating the report.





                 -a/--clearall
                           Clears all performance statistics for all ports.





                 -M/--pmadirect
                           Accesses performance statistics using direct PMA.





                 -A/--allports
                           Gets PortInfo for down switch ports. Uses direct SMA to get this data. If used with -M, also gets PMA stats for down switch ports.





                 -F/--focus point
                           Specifies the focus area for report. Used for all reports except route to limit scope of report. Refer to Point Syntax for details.




-h and -p options permit a variety of selections:
       -h 0      First active port in system (Default).


       -h 0 -p 0 First active port in system.


       -h x      First active port on HFI x.


       -h x -p 0 First active port on HFI x.


       -h 0 -p y Port y within system (no matter which ports are active).


       -h x -p y HFI x, port y.
