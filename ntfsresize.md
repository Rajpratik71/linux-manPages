NAME
       ntfsresize - resize an NTFS filesystem without data loss

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsresize [OPTIONS] --info(-mb-only) DEVICE
       ntfsresize [OPTIONS] [--size SIZE[k|M|G]] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       The ntfsresize program safely resizes Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows NT4 and Longhorn NTFS filesystems without data
       loss. All NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.  Defragmentation is NOT required prior to  resizing  because  the
       program can relocate any data if needed, without risking data integrity.

       Ntfsresize can be used to shrink or enlarge any NTFS filesystem located on an unmounted DEVICE (usually a disk partition). The new filesys‐
       tem will fit in a DEVICE whose desired size is SIZE bytes.  The SIZE parameter may have one of the optional modifiers k, M, G, which  means
       the  SIZE  parameter  is  given in kilo-, mega- or gigabytes respectively.  Ntfsresize conforms to the SI, ATA, IEEE standards and the disk
       manufacturers by using k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9.

       If both --info(-mb-only) and --size are omitted then the NTFS filesystem will be enlarged to match the underlying DEVICE size.

       To resize a filesystem on a partition, you must resize BOTH the filesystem and the partition by editing the partition table  on  the  disk.
       Similarly  to  other  command line filesystem resizers, ntfsresize doesn't manipulate the size of the partitions, hence to do that you must
       use a disk partitioning tool as well, for example fdisk(8).  Alternatively you could use one of the many user  friendly  partitioners  that
       uses  ntfsresize  internally,  like  Mandriva's DiskDrake, QTParted, SUSE/Novell's YaST Partitioner, IBM's EVMS, GParted or Debian/Ubuntu's
       Partman.

       IMPORTANT!  It's a good practice making REGULAR BACKUPS of your valuable data, especially before using ANY partitioning tools. To do so for
       NTFS, you could use ntfsclone(8).  Don't forget to save the partition table as well!

   Shrinkage
       If  you  wish to shrink an NTFS partition, first use ntfsresize to shrink the size of the filesystem. Then you could use fdisk(8) to shrink
       the size of the partition by deleting the partition and recreating it with the smaller size.  Do not make the partition  smaller  than  the
       new  size  of  NTFS  otherwise  you won't be able to boot. If you did so notwithstanding then just recreate the partition to be as large as
       NTFS.

   Enlargement
       To enlarge an NTFS filesystem, first you must enlarge the size of the underlying partition. This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting the
       partition  and  recreating it with a larger size.  Make sure it will not overlap with an other existing partition.  You may enlarge upwards
       (first sector unchanged) or downwards (last sector unchanged), but you may not enlarge at both ends in a single step.   If  you  merge  two
       NTFS  partitions,  only one of them can be expanded to the merged partition.  After you have enlarged the partition, you may use ntfsresize
       to enlarge the size of the filesystem.

   Partitioning
       When recreating the partition by a disk partitioning tool, make sure you create it at the same starting sector and with the same  partition
       type  as  before.   Otherwise  you won't be able to access your filesystem. Use the 'u' fdisk command to switch to the reliable sector unit
       from the default cylinder one.

       Also make sure you set the bootable flag for the partition if it existed before. Failing to do so you might not be able to boot  your  com‐
       puter from the disk.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a summary of all the options that ntfsresize accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded
       by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a  single  command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -c, --check
              By  using  this  option  ntfsresize  will  only check the device to ensure that it is ready to be resized. If not, it will print any
              errors detected.  If the device is fine, nothing will be printed.

       -i, --info
              By using this option without --expand, ntfsresize will determine the theoretically  smallest  shrunken  filesystem  size  supported.
              Most  of  the  time  the result is the space already used on the filesystem. Ntfsresize will refuse shrinking to a smaller size than
              what you got by this option and depending on several factors it might be unable to shrink  very  close  to  this  theoretical  size.
              Although  the  integrity  of  your  data  should  be  never in risk, it's still strongly recommended to make a test run by using the
              --no-action option before real resizing.

              Practically the smallest shrunken size generally is at around "used space" + (20-200 MB). Please also take into account that Windows
              might need about 50-100 MB free space left to boot safely.

              If used in association with option --expand, ntfsresize will determine the smallest downwards expansion size and the possible incre‐
              ments to the size. These are exact byte counts which must not be rounded.  This option may be used  after  the  partition  has  been
              expanded provided the upper bound has not been changed.

              This option never causes any changes to the filesystem, the partition is opened read-only.

       -m, --info-mb-only
              Like  the  info option, only print out the shrinkable size in MB.  Print nothing if the shrink size is the same as the original size
              (in MB).  This option cannot be used in association with option --expand.

       -s, --size SIZE[k|M|G]
              Resize filesystem to fit in a partition whose size is SIZE[k|M|G] bytes by shifting its end and keeping its beginning unchanged. The
              filesystem size is set to be at least one sector smaller than the partition.  The optional modifiers k, M, G mean the SIZE parameter
              is given in kilo-, mega- or gigabytes respectively.  Conforming to standards,  k=10^3,  M=10^6  and  G=10^9.  ki=2^10,  Mi=2^20  and
              Gi=2^30 are also allowed. Use this option with --no-action first.

       -x, --expand
              Expand  the  filesystem  to  the  current partition size, shifting down its beginning and keeping its end unchanged. The metadata is
              recreated in the expanded space and no user data is relocated. This is incompatible with option -s (or --size) and can only be  made
              if the expanded space is an exact multiple of the cluster size. It must also be large enough to hold the new metadata.

              If the expansion is interrupted for some reason (power outage, etc), you may restart the resizing, as the original data and metadata
              have been kept unchanged.

              Note : expanding a Windows system partition and filesystem downwards may lead to the registry or some files  not  matching  the  new
              system  layout,  or  to  some  important  files  being  located too far from the beginning of the partition, thus making Windows not
              bootable.

       -f, --force
              Forces ntfsresize to proceed with the resize operation either without prompting for an explicit acceptance, or if the filesystem  is
              marked  for  consistency  check.  Double  the option (-ff, --force --force) to avoid prompting even if the file system is marked for
              check.

              Please note, ntfsresize always marks the filesystem for consistency check before a real resize operation and it leaves that way  for
              extra  safety.  Thus if NTFS was marked by ntfsresize then it's safe to use this option. If you need to resize several times without
              booting into Windows between each resizing steps then you must use this option.

       -n, --no-action
              Use this option to make a test run before doing the real resize operation.  Volume will be opened read-only and ntfsresize  displays
              what it would do if it were to resize the filesystem.  Continue with the real resizing only if the test run passed.

       -b, --bad-sectors
              Support disks having hardware errors, bad sectors with those ntfsresize would refuse to work by default.

              Prior  using this option, it's strongly recommended to make a backup by ntfsclone(8) using the --rescue option, then running 'chkdsk
              /f /r volume:' on Windows from the command line. If the disk guarantee is still valid then replace it.  It's defected.  Please  also
              note, that no software can repair these type of hardware errors. The most what they can do is to work around the permanent defects.

              This option doesn't have any effect if the disk is flawless.

       -P, --no-progress-bar
              Don't show progress bars.

       -v, --verbose
              More output.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of ntfsresize and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

KNOWN ISSUES
       No  reliability  problem  is known. If you need help please try the Ntfsresize FAQ first (see below) and if you don't find your answer then
       send your question, comment or bug report to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net

       There are a few very rarely met restrictions at present: filesystems having unknown bad sectors, relocation of the first MFT extent and re‐
       sizing into the middle of a $MFTMirr extent aren't supported yet. These cases are detected and resizing is restricted to a safe size or the
       closest safe size is displayed.

       Ntfsresize schedules an NTFS consistency check and after the first boot into Windows you must see chkdsk running on a blue background. This
       is intentional and no need to worry about it.  Windows may force a quick reboot after the consistency check.  Moreover after repartitioning
       your disk and depending on the hardware configuration, the Windows message System Settings Change may also appear. Just acknowledge it  and
       reboot again.

       The  disk  geometry handling semantic (HDIO_GETGEO ioctl) has changed in an incompatible way in Linux 2.6 kernels and this triggered multi‐
       tudinous partition table corruptions resulting in unbootable Windows systems, even if NTFS was consistent, if  parted(8)  was  involved  in
       some way. This problem was often attributed to ntfsresize but in fact it's completely independent of NTFS thus ntfsresize. Moreover ntfsre‐
       size never touches the partition table at all. By changing the 'Disk Access Mode' to LBA in the BIOS makes booting work again, most of  the
       time. You can find more information about this issue in the Troubleshooting section of the below referred Ntfsresize FAQ.
