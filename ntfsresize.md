NAME
       ntfsresize - resize an NTFS filesystem without data loss

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsresize [OPTIONS] --info(-mb-only) DEVICE
       ntfsresize [OPTIONS] [--size SIZE[k|M|G]] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       The ntfsresize program safely resizes Windows XP, Windows Server 2003,
       Windows 2000, Windows NT4 and Longhorn NTFS filesystems  without  data
       loss.  All NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Win‐
       dows.  Defragmentation is NOT required prior to resizing  because  the
       program  can  relocate  any  data  if  needed,  without  risking  data
       integrity.

       Ntfsresize can be used  to  shrink  or  enlarge  any  NTFS  filesystem
       located  on  an  unmounted  DEVICE (usually a disk partition). The new
       filesystem will fit in a DEVICE whose desired size is SIZE bytes.  The
       SIZE  parameter  may have one of the optional modifiers k, M, G, which
       means the SIZE parameter is given in kilo-, mega- or gigabytes respec‐
       tively.   Ntfsresize  conforms  to the SI, ATA, IEEE standards and the
       disk manufacturers by using k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9.

       If both --info(-mb-only) and --size are omitted then the NTFS filesys‐
       tem will be enlarged to match the underlying DEVICE size.

       To  resize  a  filesystem  on  a  partition,  you must resize BOTH the
       filesystem and the partition by editing the  partition  table  on  the
       disk.  Similarly to other command line filesystem resizers, ntfsresize
       doesn't manipulate the size of the partitions, hence to  do  that  you
       must  use  a  disk  partitioning  tool  as well, for example fdisk(8).
       Alternatively you could use one of the many user friendly partitioners
       that  uses ntfsresize internally, like Mandriva's DiskDrake, QTParted,
       SUSE/Novell's YaST Partitioner, IBM's EVMS, GParted or Debian/Ubuntu's
       Partman.

       IMPORTANT!   It's a good practice making REGULAR BACKUPS of your valu‐
       able data, especially before using ANY partitioning tools.  To  do  so
       for NTFS, you could use ntfsclone(8).  Don't forget to save the parti‐
       tion table as well!

   Shrinkage
       If you wish to shrink an  NTFS  partition,  first  use  ntfsresize  to
       shrink  the  size  of  the  filesystem. Then you could use fdisk(8) to
       shrink the size of the partition by deleting the partition and  recre‐
       ating  it  with  the  smaller size.  Do not make the partition smaller
       than the new size of NTFS otherwise you won't be able to boot. If  you
       did so notwithstanding then just recreate the partition to be as large
       as NTFS.

   Enlargement
       To enlarge an NTFS filesystem, first you must enlarge the size of  the
       underlying  partition. This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting the
       partition and recreating it with a larger size.  Make sure it will not
       overlap  with  another  existing  partition.   You may enlarge upwards
       (first sector unchanged) or downwards (last sector unchanged), but you
       may  not enlarge at both ends in a single step.  If you merge two NTFS
       partitions, only one of them can be expanded to the merged  partition.
       After  you  have  enlarged  the  partition,  you may use ntfsresize to
       enlarge the size of the filesystem.

   Partitioning
       When recreating the partition by a disk partitioning tool,  make  sure
       you  create it at the same starting sector and with the same partition
       type as before.  Otherwise you won't be able to access  your  filesys‐
       tem.  Use  the 'u' fdisk command to switch to the reliable sector unit
       from the default cylinder one.

       Also make sure you set the bootable  flag  for  the  partition  if  it
       existed  before.  Failing  to do so you might not be able to boot your
       computer from the disk.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsresize accepts.  Nearly
       all  options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
       - and the long name is preceded by --.   Any  single  letter  options,
       that  don't  take  an argument, can be combined into a single command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be  abbrevi‐
       ated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -c, --check
              By  using  this option ntfsresize will only check the device to
              ensure that it is ready to be resized. If not,  it  will  print
              any  errors  detected.   If the device is fine, nothing will be
              printed.

       -i, --info
              By using this option without --expand, ntfsresize  will  deter‐
              mine  the  theoretically smallest shrunken filesystem size sup‐
              ported.  Most of the time the result is the space already  used
              on  the  filesystem.  Ntfsresize  will  refuse  shrinking  to a
              smaller size than what you got by this option and depending  on
              several factors it might be unable to shrink very close to this
              theoretical size. Although the integrity of your data should be
              never  in  risk, it's still strongly recommended to make a test
              run by using the --no-action option before real resizing.

              Practically the smallest shrunken size generally is  at  around
              "used  space" + (20-200 MB). Please also take into account that
              Windows might need about 50-100 MB  free  space  left  to  boot
              safely.

              If  used  in  association with option --expand, ntfsresize will
              determine the smallest downwards expansion size and the  possi‐
              ble  increments  to the size. These are exact byte counts which
              must not be rounded.  This option may be used after the  parti‐
              tion  has  been  expanded provided the upper bound has not been
              changed.

              This option never causes any changes  to  the  filesystem,  the
              partition is opened read-only.

       -m, --info-mb-only
              Like the info option, only print out the shrinkable size in MB.
              Print nothing if the shrink size is the same  as  the  original
              size  (in  MB).  This option cannot be used in association with
              option --expand.

       -s, --size SIZE[k|M|G]
              Resize  filesystem  to  fit  in  a  partition  whose  size   is
              SIZE[k|M|G] bytes by shifting its end and keeping its beginning
              unchanged. The filesystem size is set to be at least one sector
              smaller  than  the  partition.   The optional modifiers k, M, G
              mean the SIZE parameter is given in kilo-, mega-  or  gigabytes
              respectively.   Conforming  to  standards,  k=10^3,  M=10^6 and
              G=10^9. ki=2^10, Mi=2^20 and Gi=2^30 are also allowed. Use this
              option with --no-action first.

       -x, --expand
              Expand  the  filesystem to the current partition size, shifting
              down its beginning and keeping its end unchanged. The  metadata
              is  recreated  in  the expanded space and no user data is relo‐
              cated. This is incompatible with option -s (or --size) and  can
              only  be made if the expanded space is an exact multiple of the
              cluster size. It must also be large  enough  to  hold  the  new
              metadata.

              If  the expansion is interrupted for some reason (power outage,
              etc), you may restart the resizing, as the  original  data  and
              metadata have been kept unchanged.

              Note  :  expanding  a  Windows  system partition and filesystem
              downwards may lead to the registry or some files  not  matching
              the new system layout, or to some important files being located
              too far from the beginning of the partition, thus  making  Win‐
              dows not bootable.

       -f, --force
              Forces  ntfsresize  to proceed with the resize operation either
              without  prompting  for  an  explicit  acceptance,  or  if  the
              filesystem  is  marked for consistency check. Double the option
              (-ff, --force --force) to avoid prompting even if the file sys‐
              tem is marked for check.

              Please note, ntfsresize always marks the filesystem for consis‐
              tency check before a real resize operation and it  leaves  that
              way  for  extra  safety.  Thus if NTFS was marked by ntfsresize
              then it's safe to use this option. If you need to  resize  sev‐
              eral  times  without booting into Windows between each resizing
              steps then you must use this option.

       -n, --no-action
              Use this option to make a test run before doing the real resize
              operation.  Volume will be opened read-only and ntfsresize dis‐
              plays what it would do if it were  to  resize  the  filesystem.
              Continue with the real resizing only if the test run passed.

       -b, --bad-sectors
              Support  disks  having  hardware errors, bad sectors with those
              ntfsresize would refuse to work by default.

              Prior using this option, it's strongly recommended  to  make  a
              backup  by ntfsclone(8) using the --rescue option, then running
              'chkdsk /f /r volume:' on Windows from the command line. If the
              disk  guarantee is still valid then replace it.  It's defected.
              Please also note, that no software can  repair  these  type  of
              hardware  errors.  The  most what they can do is to work around
              the permanent defects.

              This option doesn't have any effect if the disk is flawless.

       -P, --no-progress-bar
              Don't show progress bars.

       -v, --verbose
              More output.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of ntfsresize and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

KNOWN ISSUES
       No reliability problem is known. If you need help please try the Ntfs‐
       resize  FAQ  first  (see below) and if you don't find your answer then
       send your question, comment or bug report to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net

       There are a few very rarely met restrictions at  present:  filesystems
       having unknown bad sectors, relocation of the first MFT extent and re‐
       sizing into the middle of a  $MFTMirr  extent  aren't  supported  yet.
       These  cases are detected and resizing is restricted to a safe size or
       the closest safe size is displayed.

       Ntfsresize schedules an NTFS consistency check  and  after  the  first
       boot  into  Windows  you must see chkdsk running on a blue background.
       This is intentional and no need to worry about it.  Windows may  force
       a  quick  reboot after the consistency check.  Moreover after reparti‐
       tioning your disk and depending on  the  hardware  configuration,  the
       Windows  message System Settings Change may also appear. Just acknowl‐
       edge it and reboot again.

       The disk geometry handling semantic (HDIO_GETGEO ioctl) has changed in
       an incompatible way in Linux 2.6 kernels and this triggered multitudi‐
       nous partition table corruptions resulting in unbootable Windows  sys‐
       tems,  even  if NTFS was consistent, if parted(8) was involved in some
       way. This problem was often attributed to ntfsresize but in fact  it's
       completely  independent  of  NTFS thus ntfsresize. Moreover ntfsresize
       never touches the partition table at all. By changing the 'Disk Access
       Mode'  to  LBA in the BIOS makes booting work again, most of the time.
       You can find more information about this issue in the  Troubleshooting
       section of the below referred Ntfsresize FAQ.
