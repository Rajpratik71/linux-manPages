DESCRIPTION
          PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents and archives from Hard Disks and CDRom
       and lost pictures (Photo Recovery) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the filesystem and goes after the underlying data, so it'll
       work even if your media's filesystem is severely damaged or formatted. PhotoRec is safe to use, it will never attempt to write to the drive
       or memory support you are about to recover lost data from.
          For more information on how to use, please visit the wiki pages on www.cgsecurity.org
