NAME
       emacs - GNU project Emacs

SYNOPSIS
       emacs [ command-line switches ] [ files ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  Emacs is a version of Emacs, written by the author of the original (PDP-10) Emacs, Richard Stallman.  The user functionality of GNU Emacs encompasses everything other editors do, and it is eas-
       ily extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

       The primary documentation of GNU Emacs is in the GNU Emacs Manual, which you can read using Info, either from Emacs or as a standalone program.  Please look there for complete and  up-to-date  docu-
       mentation.  This man page is updated only when someone volunteers to do so.

       Emacs  has  an extensive interactive help facility, but the facility assumes that you know how to manipulate Emacs windows and buffers.  CTRL-h or F1 enters the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h
       t) starts an interactive tutorial to quickly teach beginners the fundamentals of Emacs.  Help Apropos (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command with a name matching a given pattern, Help  Key  (CTRL-h  k)
       describes a given key sequence, and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp function.

       GNU Emacs's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile), running subshells within Emacs windows (Shell), running a Lisp read-
       eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy (Doctor), and much more.

   Emacs Options
       The following options are of general interest:

              file    Edit file.

              --file file, --find-file file, --visit file
                      The same as specifying file directly as an argument.

              +number Go to the line specified by number (do not insert a space between the "+" sign and the number).  This applies only to the next file specified.

              +line:column
                      Go to the specified line and column.

              -q, --no-init-file
                      Do not load an init file.

              --no-site-file
                      Do not load the site-wide startup file.

              --no-desktop
                      Do not load a saved desktop.

              -Q, --quick
                      Similar to "-q --no-site-file --no-splash".  Also, avoid processing X resources.

              --no-splash
                      Do not display a splash screen during start-up.

              --debug-init
                      Enable Emacs Lisp debugger during the processing of the user init file ~/.emacs.  This is useful for debugging problems in the init file.

              -u user, --user user
                      Load user's init file.

              -t file, --terminal file
                      Use specified file as the terminal instead of using stdin/stdout.  This must be the first argument specified in the command line.

              --daemon
                      Start Emacs as a daemon, enabling the Emacs server and disconnecting from the terminal.  You can then use the emacsclient command to connect to the server (see emacsclient(1)).

              --version
                      Display Emacs version information and exit.

              --help  Display this help and exit.

       The following options are Lisp-oriented (these options are processed in the order encountered):

              -f function, --funcall function
                      Execute the lisp function function.

              -l file, --load file
                      Load the lisp code in the file file.

              --eval expr, --execute expr
                      Evaluate the Lisp expression expr.

       The following options are useful when running Emacs as a batch editor:

              --batch Edit in batch mode.  The editor will send messages to stderr.  You must use -l and -f options to specify files to execute and functions to call.

              --script file
                      Run file as an Emacs Lisp script.

              --insert file
                      Insert contents of file into the current buffer.

              --kill  Exit Emacs while in batch mode.

              -L dir, --directory dir
                      Add dir to the list of directories Emacs searches for Lisp files.

   Using Emacs with X
       Emacs has been tailored to work well with the X window system.  If you run Emacs from under X windows, it will create its own X window to display in.  You will probably want to start the editor as a
       background process so that you can continue using your original window.

       Emacs can be started with the following X switches:

              --name name
                      Specify the name which should be assigned to the initial Emacs window.  This controls looking up X resources as well as the window title.

              -T name, --title name
                      Specify the title for the initial X window.

              -r, -rv, --reverse-video
                      Display the Emacs window in reverse video.

              -fn font, --font font
                      Set  the  Emacs  window's  font to that specified by font.  You will find the various X fonts in the /usr/lib/X11/fonts directory.  Note that Emacs will only accept fixed width fonts.
                      Under the X11 Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the font name is a fixed width font.  Furthermore, fonts whose name are of
                      the form widthxheight are generally fixed width, as is the font fixed.  See xlsfonts(1) for more information.

                      When you specify a font, be sure to put a space between the switch and the font name.

              --xrm resources
                      Set additional X resources.

              --color, --color=mode
                      Override color mode for character terminals; mode defaults to `auto', and can also be `never', `auto', `always', or a mode name like `ansi8'.

              -bw pixels, --border-width pixels
                      Set the Emacs window's border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels.  Defaults to one pixel on each side of the window.

              -ib pixels, --internal-border pixels
                      Set the window's internal border width to the number of pixels specified by pixels.  Defaults to one pixel of padding on each side of the window.

              -g geometry, --geometry geometry
                      Set  the  Emacs  window's  width,  height, and position as specified.  The geometry specification is in the standard X format; see X(7) for more information.  The width and height are
                      specified in characters; the default is 80 by 24.  See the Emacs manual, section "Options for Window Size and Position", for information on how window sizes interact with selecting or
                      deselecting the tool bar and menu bar.

              -lsp pixels, --line-spacing pixels
                      Additional space to put between lines.

              -vb, --vertical-scroll-bars
                      Enable vertical scrollbars.

              -fh, --fullheight
                      Make the first frame as high as the screen.

              -fs, --fullscreen
                      Make the first frame fullscreen.

              -fw, --fullwidth
                      Make the first frame as wide as the screen.

              -mm, --maximized
                      Maximize the first frame, like "-fw -fh".

              -fg color, --foreground-color color
                      On color displays, set the color of the text.

                      Use the command M-x list-colors-display for a list of valid color names.

              -bg color, --background-color color
                      On color displays, set the color of the window's background.

              -bd color, --border-color color
                      On color displays, set the color of the window's border.

              -cr color, --cursor-color color
                      On color displays, set the color of the window's text cursor.

              -ms color, --mouse-color color
                      On color displays, set the color of the window's mouse cursor.

              -d displayname, --display displayname
                      Create the Emacs window on the display specified by displayname.  Must be the first option specified in the command line.

              -nbi, --no-bitmap-icon
                      Do not use picture of gnu for Emacs icon.

              --iconic
                      Start Emacs in iconified state.

              -nbc, --no-blinking-cursor
                      Disable blinking cursor.

              -nw, --no-window-system
                      Tell Emacs not to create a graphical frame.  If you use this switch when invoking Emacs from an xterm(1) window, display is done in that window.

              -D, --basic-display
                      This option disables many display features; use it for debugging Emacs.

       You can set X default values for your Emacs windows in your .Xresources file (see xrdb(1)).  Use the following format:

              emacs.keyword:value

       where value specifies the default value of keyword.  Emacs lets you set default values for the following keywords:

              background (class Background)
                      For color displays, sets the window's background color.

              bitmapIcon (class BitmapIcon)
                      If bitmapIcon's value is set to on, the window will iconify into the "kitchen sink."

              borderColor (class BorderColor)
                      For color displays, sets the color of the window's border.

              borderWidth (class BorderWidth)
                      Sets the window's border width in pixels.

              cursorColor (class Foreground)
                      For color displays, sets the color of the window's text cursor.

              cursorBlink (class CursorBlink)
                      Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.  The default is on.  Use off or false to turn cursor blinking off.

              font (class Font)
                      Sets the window's text font.

              foreground (class Foreground)
                      For color displays, sets the window's text color.

              fullscreen (class Fullscreen)
                      The  desired  fullscreen  size.   The  value  can be one of fullboth, maximized, fullwidth, or fullheight, which correspond to the command-line options `-fs', `-mm', `-fw', and `-fh',
                      respectively.  Note that this applies to the initial frame only.

              geometry (class Geometry)
                      Sets the geometry of the Emacs window (as described above).

              iconName (class Title)
                      Sets the icon name for the Emacs window icon.

              internalBorder (class BorderWidth)
                      Sets the window's internal border width in pixels.

              lineSpacing (class LineSpacing)
                      Additional space ("leading") between lines, in pixels.

              menuBar (class MenuBar)
                      Gives frames menu bars if on; don't have menu bars if off.  See the Emacs manual, sections "Lucid Resources" and "LessTif Resources", for how to control the appearance of the menu bar
                      if you have one.

              minibuffer (class Minibuffer)
                      If none, don't make a minibuffer in this frame.  It will use a separate minibuffer frame instead.

              paneFont (class Font)
                      Font name for menu pane titles, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs.

              pointerColor (class Foreground)
                      For color displays, sets the color of the window's mouse cursor.

              privateColormap (class PrivateColormap)
                      If on, use a private color map, in the case where the "default visual" of class PseudoColor and Emacs is using it.

              reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo)
                      If reverseVideo's value is set to on, the window will be displayed in reverse video.

              screenGamma (class ScreenGamma)
                      Gamma correction for colors, equivalent to the frame parameter `screen-gamma'.

              scrollBarWidth (class ScrollBarWidth)
                      The scroll bar width in pixels, equivalent to the frame parameter `scroll-bar-width'.

              selectionFont (class SelectionFont)
                      Font name for pop-up menu items, in non-toolkit versions of Emacs.  (For toolkit versions, see the Emacs manual, sections "Lucid Resources" and "LessTif Resources".)

              selectionTimeout (class SelectionTimeout)
                      Number of milliseconds to wait for a selection reply.  A value of 0 means wait as long as necessary.

              synchronous (class Synchronous)
                      Run Emacs in synchronous mode if on.  Synchronous mode is useful for debugging X problems.

              title (class Title)
                      Sets the title of the Emacs window.

              toolBar (class ToolBar)
                      Number of lines to reserve for the tool bar.

              useXIM (class UseXIM)
                      Turns off use of X input methods (XIM) if false or off.

              verticalScrollBars (class ScrollBars)
                      Gives frames scroll bars if on; suppresses scroll bars if off.

              visualClass (class VisualClass)
                      Specify  the "visual" that X should use.  This tells X how to handle colors.  The value should start with one of TrueColor, PseudoColor, DirectColor, StaticColor, GrayScale, and Stat-
                      icGray, followed by -depth, where depth is the number of color planes.

MANUALS
       You can order printed copies of the GNU Emacs Manual from the Free Software Foundation, which develops GNU software.  See the online store at <http://shop.fsf.org/>.
       Your local administrator might also have copies available.  As with all software and publications from FSF, everyone is permitted to make and distribute copies of  the  Emacs  manual.   The  Texinfo
       source to the manual is also included in the Emacs source distribution.

FILES
       /usr/local/share/info  —  files  for  the Info documentation browser.  The complete text of the Emacs reference manual is included in a convenient tree structured form.  Also includes the Emacs Lisp
       Reference Manual, useful to anyone wishing to write programs in the Emacs Lisp extension language, and the Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/lisp — Lisp source files and compiled files that define most editing commands.  Some are preloaded; others are autoloaded from this directory when used.

       /usr/local/libexec/emacs/$VERSION/$ARCH — various programs that are used with GNU Emacs.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc — various files of information.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/DOC.* — contains the documentation strings for the Lisp primitives and preloaded Lisp functions of GNU Emacs.  They are stored here to reduce the  size  of  Emacs
       proper.

       /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/SERVICE lists people offering various services to assist users of GNU Emacs, including education, troubleshooting, porting and customization.

BUGS
       There is a mailing list, bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org, for reporting Emacs bugs and fixes.  But before reporting something as a bug, please try to be sure that it really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or
       a deliberate feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Bugs'' in the Emacs manual for hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the version number of the Emacs you are  running
       in every bug report that you send in.  Bugs tend actually to be fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in your interest to report them in such a way that they can be easily reproduced.

       Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone in the next release, if possible.  For personal assistance, look in the SERVICE file
       (see above) for a list of people who offer it.

       Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing list.  For more information about Emacs mailing lists, see the file /usr/local/share/emacs/$VERSION/etc/MAILINGLISTS.

UNRESTRICTIONS
       Emacs is free; anyone may redistribute copies of Emacs to anyone under the terms stated in the GNU General Public License, a copy of which accompanies each copy of Emacs and which  also  appears  in
       the reference manual.

       Copies of Emacs may sometimes be received packaged with distributions of Unix systems, but it is never included in the scope of any license covering those systems.  Such inclusion violates the terms
       on which distribution is permitted.  In fact, the primary purpose of the GNU General Public License is to prohibit anyone from attaching any other restrictions to redistribution of Emacs.

       Richard Stallman encourages you to improve and extend Emacs, and urges that you contribute your extensions to the GNU library.  Eventually GNU (Gnu's Not Unix) will be  a  complete  replacement  for
       Unix.  Everyone will be free to use, copy, study and change the GNU system.
