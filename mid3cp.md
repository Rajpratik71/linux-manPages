NAME
       mid3cp - copy ID3 tags

SYNOPSIS
       mid3cp [options] source dest

DESCRIPTION
       mid3cp copies the ID3 tags from a source file to a destination file.

       It  is  designed to provide similar functionality to id3lib's id3cp tool, and can optionally write ID3v1 tags. It can also exclude specific
       tags from being copied.

OPTIONS
       --verbose, -v
              Be verbose: state all operations performed, and list tags in source file.

       --write-v1
              Write ID3v1 tags to the destination file, derived from the ID3v2 tags.

       --exclude-tag, -x
              Exclude a specific tag from being copied. Can be specified multiple times.
