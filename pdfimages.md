NAME
       pdfimages  -  Portable  Document Format (PDF) image extractor (version
       3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdfimages [options] PDF-file image-root

DESCRIPTION
       Pdfimages saves images from a Portable Document Format (PDF)  file  as
       Portable  Pixmap (PPM), Portable Bitmap (PBM), Portable Network Graph‐
       ics (PNG), Tagged Image File Format (TIFF), JPEG, JPEG2000,  or  JBIG2
       files.

       Pdfimages  reads  the  PDF file PDF-file, scans one or more pages, and
       writes one file for each image, image-root-nnn.xxx, where nnn  is  the
       image  number and xxx is the image type (.ppm, .pbm, .png, .tif, .jpg,
       jp2, jb2e, or jb2g).

       The default output format is PBM (for monochrome images)  or  PPM  for
       non-monochrome.  The -png or -tiff options change to default output to
       PNG or TIFF respectively. If both -png and -tiff are  specified,  CMYK
       images will be written as TIFF and all other images will be written as
       PNG. In addition the -j, -jp2, and -jbig2  options  will  cause  JPEG,
       JPEG2000,  and JBIG2, respectively, images in the PDF file to be writ‐
       ten in their native format.

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to scan.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to scan.

       -png   Change the default output format to PNG.

       -tiff  Change the default output format to TIFF.

       -j     Write images in JPEG  format  as  JPEG  files  instead  of  the
              default  format.  The  JPEG  file is identical to the JPEG data
              stored in the PDF.

       -jp2   Write images in JPEG2000 format as JP2  files  instead  of  the
              default  format. The JP2 file is identical to the JPEG2000 data
              stored in the PDF.

       -jbig2 Write images in JBIG2 format as  JBIG2  files  instead  of  the
              default  format. JBIG2 data in PDF is of the embedded type. The
              embedded type of JBIG2 has an optional separate file containing
              global  data.  The  embedded data is written with the extension
              .jb2e and the global data (if available) will be written to the
              same image number with the extension .jb2g. The content of both
              these files is identical to the JBIG2 data in the PDF.

       -ccitt Write images in CCITT format as  CCITT  files  instead  of  the
              default  format.  The CCITT file is identical to the CCITT data
              stored in the PDF.  PDF  files  contain  additional  parameters
              specifying  how  to decode the CCITT data. These parameters are
              translated to fax2tiff input options and written to  a  .params
              file with the same image number. The parameters are:

              -1     1D Group 3 encoding

              -2     2D Group 3 encoding

              -4     Group 4 encoding

              -A     Beginning of line is aligned on a byte boundary

              -P     Beginning of line is not aligned on a byte boundary

              -X n   The image width in pixels

              -W     Encoding uses 1 for black and 0 for white

              -B     Encoding uses 0 for black and 1 for white

              -M     Input data fills from most significant bit to least sig‐
                     nificant bit.

       -all   Write JPEG, JPEG2000, JBIG2, and CCITT images in  their  native
              format.  CMYK files are written as TIFF files. All other images
              are written as PNG files.  This is equivalent to specifying the
              options -png -tiff -j -jp2 -jbig2 -ccitt.

       -list  Instead of writing the images, list the images along with vari‐
              ous information for each image. Do not  specify  an  image-root
              with this option.

              The following information is listed for each image:

              page   the page number containing the image

              num    the image number

              type   the image type:

                     image - an opaque image
                     mask - a monochrome mask image
                     smask - a soft-mask image
                     stencil  -  a  monochrome mask image used for painting a
                     color or pattern

              Note: Tranparency in images is represented in PDF using a sepa‐
              rate  image  for  the image and the mask/smask.  The mask/smask
              used as part of a transparent image always immediately  follows
              the image in the image list.

              width  image width (in pixels)

              height image height (in pixels)

              Note: the image width/height is the size of the embedded image,
              not the size the image will be rendered at.

              color  image color space:

                     gray - Gray
                     rgb - RGB
                     cmyk - CMYK
                     lab - L*a*b
                     icc - ICC Based
                     index - Indexed Color
                     sep - Separation
                     devn - DeviceN

              comp   number of color components

              bpc    bits per component

              enc    encoding:

                     image - raster image (may be Flate or LZW compressed but
                     does not use an image encoding)
                     jpeg - Joint Photographic Experts Group
                     jp2 - JPEG2000
                     jbig2 - Joint Bi-Level Image Experts Group
                     ccitt - CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 Fax

              interp "yes" if the interpolation is to be performed when scal‐
                     ing up the image

              object ID
                     the image dictionary object ID (number and generation)

              x-ppi  The horizontal resolution of the image  (in  pixels  per
                     inch) when rendered on the pdf page.

              y-ppi  The  vertical  resolution  of  the  image (in pixels per
                     inch) when rendered on the pdf page.

              size   The size of the embedded image in the pdf file. The fol‐
                     lowing  suffixes are used: 'B' bytes, 'K' kilobytes, 'M'
                     megabytes, and 'G' gigabytes.

              ratio  The compression ratio of the embedded image.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF  file.   Providing  this
              will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -p     Include page numbers in output file names.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
