NAME
       includeres - filter to include resources in a PostScript document

SYNOPSIS
       includeres < document.ps > output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       Includeres  includes resources (fonts, procsets, patterns, files, etc) in place of %%IncludeResource comments in a PostScript document. The
       resources are searched for in the current directory and the system default directory under the  resource  name,  and  with  an  appropriate
       extension.  The pipeline

                                                         extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

       will  move  all  resources  appearing  in  a  document to the document prologue, removing redundant copies. The output file can then be put
       through page re-arrangement filters such as psnup or pstops safely.

FILES
       /usr/lib/psutils - system resource directory.
