NAME
       unattended-upgrade - automatic installation of security (and other) upgrades

SYNOPSIS
       unattended-upgrade [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  can  download and install security upgrades automatically and unattended, taking
       care to only install packages from the configured APT source, and  checking  for  dpkg  prompts
       about  configuration  file  changes.  All  operations  are  logged  to  /var/log/unattended-up‚Äê
       grades/unattended-upgrades.log  and  the  package  manager   (dpkg)   output   is   logged   to
       /var/log/unattended-upgrades/unattended-upgrades-dpkg.log

       This  script is the backend for the APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade option and designed to be
       run periodically by APT's systemd service (apt-daily-upgrade.service) or from  cron  (e.g.  via
       /etc/cron.daily/apt).
