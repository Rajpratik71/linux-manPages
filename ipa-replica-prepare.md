NAME
       ipa-replica-prepare - Create an IPA replica file

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-replica-prepare [OPTION]... hostname

DESCRIPTION
       Generates a replica file that may be used with ipa-replica-install to create a replica of an IPA server.

       A replica can be created on any IPA master or replica server.

       You  must provide the fully-qualified hostname of the machine you want to install the replica on and a host-specific replica_file will be created. It is host-specific because SSL server certificates
       are generated as part of the process and they are specific to a particular hostname.

       If IPA manages the DNS for your domain, you should either use the --ip-address option or add the forward and reverse records manually using IPA plugins.

       Once the file has been created it will be named replica-hostname. This file can then be moved across the network to the target machine and a new IPA  replica  setup  by  running  ipa-replica-install
       replica-hostname.

   Limitations
       A replica should only be installed on the same or higher version of IPA on the remote system.

       A replica with PKI can only be installed from a replica file prepared on a master with PKI.

OPTIONS
       --dirsrv-cert-file=FILE
              File  containing the Directory Server SSL certificate and private key. The files are accepted in PEM and DER certificate, PKCS#7 certificate chain, PKCS#8 and raw private key and PKCS#12 for‚Äê

       --http-cert-file=FILE
              File containing the Apache Server SSL certificate and private key. The files are accepted in PEM and DER certificate, PKCS#7 certificate chain, PKCS#8 and raw private key and PKCS#12 formats.
              This option may be used multiple times.

       --dirsrv-pin=PIN
              The password to unlock the Directory Server private key

       --http-pin=PIN
              The password to unlock the Apache Server private key

       --dirsrv-cert-name=NAME
              Name of the Directory Server SSL certificate to install

       --http-cert-name=NAME
