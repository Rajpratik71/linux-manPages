       mkntfs  [ -C ] [ -c cluster-size ] [ -F ] [ -f ] [ -H heads ] [ -h ] [
       -I ] [ -L volume-label ] [ -l ] [ -n ] [ -p part-start-sect ] [ -Q ] [

       tors ]

DESCRIPTION
       mkntfs  is  used  to create an NTFS file system on a device (usually a
       disk partition) or file.  device is the special file corresponding  to
       the  device  (e.g /dev/hdXX).  number-of-sectors is the number of sec‐
       tors on the device. If omitted, mkntfs automagically figures the  file
       system size.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that mkntfs accepts.  Nearly all
       options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  preceded  by  -
       and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that
       don't take an argument, can be combined into a  single  command,  e.g.
       -fv  is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to
       any unique prefix of their name.

   Basic options
       -f, --fast, -Q, --quick
              Perform quick (fast) format. This will skip both zeroing of the
              volume and bad sector checking.

       -L, --label STRING
              Set the volume label for the filesystem.

       -C, --enable-compression
              Enable compression on the volume.

       -n, --no-action
              Causes  mkntfs to not actually create a filesystem, but display
              what it would do if it were to create a filesystem.  All  steps
              of  the format are carried out except the actual writing to the
              device.

   Advanced options
       -c, --cluster-size BYTES
              Specify the size of clusters in bytes. Valid cluster size  val‐
              ues  are  powers  of  two, with at least 256, and at most 65536
              bytes per cluster. If omitted, mkntfs uses 4096  bytes  as  the
              default cluster size.

              Note  that the default cluster size is set to be at least equal
              to the sector size as a cluster cannot be smaller than  a  sec‐
              tor.  Also,  note  that  values greater than 4096 have the side
              effect that compression is disabled on the volume (due to limi‐
              tations  in  the NTFS compression algorithm currently in use by
              Windows).

       -s, --sector-size BYTES
              Specify the size of sectors in bytes. Valid sector size  values
              are 256, 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes per sector. If omitted,
              mkntfs attempts to determine the sector-size automatically  and
              if that fails a default of 512 bytes per sector is used.

       -p, --partition-start SECTOR
              Specify  the  partition start sector. The maximum is 4294967295
              (2^32-1).   If   omitted,   mkntfs   attempts   to    determine
              part-start-sect automatically and if that fails or the value is
              oversized, a default of 0 is  used.  The  partition  is  usable
              despite   a   wrong   value,   however   note  that  a  correct
              part-start-sect is required for Windows to be able to boot from
              the created volume.

       -H, --heads NUM
              Specify  the number of heads. The maximum is 65535 (0xffff). If
              omitted, mkntfs attempts to determine the number of heads auto‐
              matically  and  if that fails a default of 0 is used. Note that
              heads is required for Windows to be able to boot from the  cre‐
              ated volume.

       -S, --sectors-per-track NUM
              Specify  the  number of sectors per track. The maximum is 65535
              (0xffff). If omitted, mkntfs attempts to determine  the  number
              of  sectors-per-track automatically and if that fails a default
              of 0 is used. Note that sectors-per-track is required for  Win‐
              dows to be able to boot from the created volume.

       -z, --mft-zone-multiplier NUM
              Set  the  MFT zone multiplier, which determines the size of the
              MFT zone to use on the volume. The MFT zone is the area at  the
              beginning  of  the  volume  reserved  for the master file table
              (MFT), which stores the on disk inodes (MFT  records).   It  is
              noteworthy  that  small  files  are  stored entirely within the
              inode; thus, if you expect to use the volume for storing  large
              numbers  of very small files, it is useful to set the zone mul‐
              tiplier to a higher value. Note, that the MFT zone  is  resized
              on  the fly as required during operation of the NTFS driver but
              choosing a good value will reduce fragmentation.  Valid  values
              are 1, 2, 3 and 4. The values have the following meaning:

              ┌────────────────────────────────┐
              │MFT zone     MFT zone size      │
              │multiplier   (% of volume size) │
              │    1        12.5% (default)    │
              │    2        25.0%              │
              │    3        37.5%              │
              │    4        50.0%              │
              └────────────────────────────────┘

       -T, --zero-time
              Fake  the  time  to be 00:00:00 UTC, Jan 1, 1970 instead of the
              current system time.  This is only really useful for  debugging
              purposes.

       -U, --with-uuid
              Generate a random volume UUID.

       -I, --no-indexing
              Disable  content indexing on the volume. (This is only meaning‐
              ful on Windows 2000 and  later.  Windows  NT  4.0  and  earlier
              ignore this as they do not implement content indexing at all.)

       -F, --force
              Force  mkntfs  to  run,  even  if the specified device is not a
              block special device, or appears to be mounted.

   Output options
       -q, --quiet
              Quiet execution; only errors are written to stderr,  no  output
              to stdout occurs at all. Useful if mkntfs is run in a script.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose execution.

       --debug
              Really  verbose execution; includes the verbose output from the
              -v option as well as additional  output  useful  for  debugging
              mkntfs.

   Help options
       -V, --version
              Print the version number of mkntfs and exit.

       -l, --license
              Print the licensing information of mkntfs and exit.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

KNOWN ISSUES
       When  applying  chkdsk to a file system, it sometimes throws a warning
       "Correcting errors in the uppercase file." The uppercase file is  cre‐
       ated  while formatting and it defines the mapping of lower case  char‐
       acters to upper case ones, as needed to sort file  names  in  directo‐
       ries.  The  warning  means that the uppercase file defined on the file
       system is not the same as the one used by  the  Windows  OS  on  which
       chkdsk  is running, and this may happen because newer versions of Win‐
       dows take into account new characters defined by the  Unicode  consor‐
       tium.

       Currently,  mkntfs  creates  the uppercase table so that no warning is
       thrown by Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows  8.  A  warning  may  be
       thrown  by  other Windows versions, or if chkdsk is applied in succes‐
       sion on different Windows versions.
