BADBLOCKS(8)               System Manager's Manual               BADBLOCKS(8)

NAME
       badblocks - search a device for bad blocks

SYNOPSIS
       badblocks  [  -svwnfBX  ] [ -b block_size ] [ -c blocks_at_once ] [ -d
       read_delay_factor ] [ -e max_bad_blocks ] [ -i input_file ] [ -o  out‐
       put_file ] [ -p num_passes ] [ -t test_pattern ] device [ last_block ]
       [ first_block ]

DESCRIPTION
       badblocks is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk
       partition).   device  is  the special file corresponding to the device
       (e.g /dev/hdc1).  last_block is the last block to be checked; if it is
       not  specified,  the  last  block  on the device is used as a default.
       first_block is an optional parameter  specifying  the  starting  block
       number  for  the test, which allows the testing to start in the middle
       of the disk.  If it is not specified the first block on  the  disk  is
       used as a default.

       Important  note:  If the output of badblocks is going to be fed to the
       e2fsck or mke2fs programs, it is important  that  the  block  size  is
       properly  specified,  since  the block numbers which are generated are
       very dependent on the block size in use by the filesystem.   For  this
       reason,  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  users  not run badblocks
       directly, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and  mke2fs  pro‐
       grams.

OPTIONS
       -b block_size
              Specify the size of blocks in bytes.  The default is 1024.

       -c number of blocks
              is  the  number  of  blocks  which  are  tested at a time.  The
              default is 64.

       -d read delay factor
              This parameter, if passed and non-zero, will cause  bad  blocks
              to  sleep  between reads if there were no errors encountered in
              the read operation; the delay will be calculated as a  percent‐
              age of the time it took for the read operation to be performed.
              In other words, a value of 100  will  cause  each  read  to  be
              delayed  by  the  amount the previous read took, and a value of
              200 by twice the amount.

       -e max bad block count
              Specify a maximum number of  bad  blocks  before  aborting  the
              test.   The  default is 0, meaning the test will continue until
              the end of the test range is reached.

       -f     Normally, badblocks will refuse to do a read/write  or  a  non-
              destructive test on a device which is mounted, since either can
              cause  the  system  to  potentially  crash  and/or  damage  the
              filesystem  even if it is mounted read-only.  This can be over‐
              ridden using the -f flag, but should almost never be  used  ---
              if  you  think  you're  smarter than the badblocks program, you
              almost certainly aren't.  The only time when this option  might
              be  safe  to use is if the /etc/mtab file is incorrect, and the
              device really isn't mounted.

       -i input_file
              Read a list of already existing known  bad  blocks.   Badblocks
              will  skip testing these blocks since they are known to be bad.
              If input_file is specified as "-", the list will be  read  from
              the standard input.  Blocks listed in this list will be omitted
              from the list of new bad blocks produced on the standard output
              or  in  the  output  file.  The -b option of dumpe2fs(8) can be
              used to retrieve the list of blocks currently marked bad on  an
              existing  filesystem,  in  a  format suitable for use with this
              option.

       -n     Use non-destructive read-write mode.  By default  only  a  non-
              destructive  read-only  test  is done.  This option must not be
              combined with the -w option, as they are mutually exclusive.

       -o output_file
              Write the list of bad blocks to the  specified  file.   Without
              this  option,  badblocks displays the list on its standard out‐
              put.  The format of this file is suitable for  use  by  the  -l
              option in e2fsck(8) or mke2fs(8).

       -p num_passes
              Repeat  scanning the disk until there are no new blocks discov‐
              ered in num_passes consecutive scans of the disk.   Default  is
              0, meaning badblocks will exit after the first pass.

       -s     Show  the  progress of the scan by writing out rough percentage
              completion of the current badblocks pass over the  disk.   Note
              that  badblocks  may  do multiple test passes over the disk, in
              particular if the -p or -w option is requested by the user.

       -t test_pattern
              Specify a test pattern to be read (and written) to disk blocks.
              The  test_pattern  may  either be a numeric value between 0 and
              ULONG_MAX-1 inclusive, or the word  "random",  which  specifies
              that the block should be filled with a random bit pattern.  For
              read/write (-w) and non-destructive (-n)  modes,  one  or  more
              test  patterns may be specified by specifying the -t option for
              each test pattern desired.  For read-only mode  only  a  single
              pattern may be specified and it may not be "random".  Read-only
              testing with a pattern assumes that the specified  pattern  has
              previously  been written to the disk - if not, large numbers of
              blocks will fail verification.  If multiple patterns are speci‐
              fied  then  all  blocks  will be tested with one pattern before
              proceeding to the next pattern.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Will write the  number  of  read  errors,  write
              errors and data- corruptions to stderr.

       -w     Use  write-mode test. With this option, badblocks scans for bad
              blocks by writing some patterns (0xaa,  0x55,  0xff,  0x00)  on
              every  block  of  the device, reading every block and comparing
              the contents.  This option may not  be  combined  with  the  -n
              option, as they are mutually exclusive.

       -B     Use  buffered  I/O  and  do  not  use Direct I/O, even if it is
              available.

       -X     Internal flag only to be used by e2fsck(8) and  mke2fs(8).   It
              bypasses the exclusive mode in-use device safety check.

WARNING
       Never  use  the -w option on a device containing an existing file sys‐
       tem.  This option erases data!  If you want to do  write-mode  testing
       on  an existing file system, use the -n option instead.  It is slower,
       but it will preserve your data.

       The -e option will cause badblocks to  output  a  possibly  incomplete
       list  of  bad  blocks. Therefore it is recommended to use it only when
       one wants to know if there are any bad blocks at all  on  the  device,
       and not when the list of bad blocks is wanted.
