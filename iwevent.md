IWEVENT(8)                             Linux Programmer's Manual                            IWEVENT(8)

NAME
       iwevent - Display Wireless Events generated by drivers and setting changes

SYNOPSIS
       iwevent

DESCRIPTION
       iwevent  displays Wireless Events received through the RTNetlink socket. Each line displays the
       specific Wireless Event which describes what has happened on the specified wireless interface.
       This command doesn't take any arguments.

DISPLAY
       There are two classes of Wireless Events.

       The first class is events related to a change of wireless settings on the interface  (typically
       done through iwconfig or a script calling iwconfig).  Only settings that could result in a dis‐
       ruption of connectivity are reported. The events currently reported are  changing  one  of  the
       following setting :
            Network ID
            ESSID
            Frequency
            Mode
            Encryption
       All  those events will be generated on all wireless interfaces by the kernel wireless subsystem
       (but only if the driver has been converted to the new driver API).

       The second class of events are events generated by the hardware, when something  happens  or  a
       task has been finished. Those events include :

       New Access Point/Cell address
              The interface has joined a new Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost its association with
              it. This is the same address that is reported by iwconfig.

       Scan request completed
              A scanning request has been completed, results of the scan are available (see iwlist).

       Tx packet dropped
              A packet directed at this address has been dropped because the interface  believes  this
              node  doesn't answer anymore (usually maximum of MAC level retry exceeded). This is usu‐
              ally an early indication that the node may have left the cell or gone out of range,  but
              it may be due to fading or excessive contention.

       Custom driver event
              Event specific to the driver. Please check the driver documentation.

       Registered node
              The  interface has successfully registered a new wireless client/peer. Will be generated
              mostly when the interface acts as an Access Point (mode Master).

       Expired node
              The registration of the client/peer on this interface has  expired.  Will  be  generated
              mostly when the interface acts as an Access Point (mode Master).

       Spy threshold crossed
              The  signal strength for one of the addresses in the spy list went under the low thresh‐
              old or went above the high threshold.

       Most wireless drivers generate only a subset of those events, not all of them, the  exact  list
       depends  on  the specific hardware/driver combination. Please refer to driver documentation for
       details on when they are generated, and use iwlist(8) to check what the driver supports.
