NAME
       lpr - print files

SYNOPSIS
       lpr [ -E ] [ -H server[:port] ] [ -U username ] [ -P destination[/instance] ] [ -# num-copies [
       -h ] [ -l ] [ -m ] [ -o option[=value] ] [ -p ] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C title ] [ -J title  ]  [  -T
       title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr  submits files for printing.  Files named on the command line are sent to the named printer
       or the default destination if no destination is specified.  If no files are listed on the  com‐
       mand-line, lpr reads the print file from the standard input.

   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS  provides  many  ways  to  set the default destination. The LPDEST and PRINTER environment
       variables are consulted first.  If neither are set, the current default  set  using  the  lpop‐
       tions(1) command is used, followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -C "name"

       -J "name"

       -T "name"
            Sets the job name/title.

       -P destination[/instance]
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -# copies
            Sets the number of copies to print.

       -h   Disables banner printing. This option is equivalent to -o job-sheets=none.

       -l   Specifies  that the print file is already formatted for the destination and should be sent
            without filtering.  This option is equivalent to -o raw.

       -m   Send an email on job completion.

       -o option[=value]
            Sets a job option.  See "COMMON JOB OPTIONS" below.

       -p   Specifies that the print file should be formatted with a  shaded  header  with  the  date,
            time,  job name, and page number.  This option is equivalent to -o prettyprint and is only
            useful when printing text files.

       -q   Hold job for printing.

       -r   Specifies that the named print files should be deleted after submitting them.

   COMMON JOB OPTIONS
       Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the  lpoptions(1)  command,  the  following
       generic options are available:

       -o collate=true
            Prints collated copies.

       -o fit-to-page
            Scales the print file to fit on the page.

       -o job-hold-until=when
            Holds  the job until the specified local time.  "when" can be "indefinite" to hold the un‐
            til released, "day-time" to print the job between 6am and 6pm local time, "night" to print
            the  job  between  6pm and 6am local time, "second-shift" to print the job between 4pm and
            12am local time, "third-shift" to print the job between 12am and 8am local time, or "week‐
            end" to print the job on Saturday or Sunday.

       -o job-hold-until=hh:mm
            Holds the job until the specified time in hours and minutes UTC.

       -o job-priority=priority
            Set  the priority to a value from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest), which influences when a job
            is scheduled for printing.  The default priority is typically 50.

       -o job-sheets=name
            Prints a cover page (banner) with the document.  The "name" can be  "classified",  "confi‐
            dential", "secret", "standard", "topsecret", or "unclassified".

       -o job-sheets=start-name,end-name
            Prints cover pages (banners) with the document.

       -o media=size
            Sets  the page size to size. Most printers support at least the size names "a4", "letter",
            and "legal".

       -o mirror
            Mirrors each page.

       -o number-up={2|4|6|9|16}
            Prints 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 document (input) pages on each output page.

       -o number-up-layout=layout
            Specifies the layout of pages with the "number-up" option.  The  "layout"  string  can  be
            "btlr",  "btrl", "lrbt", "lrtb", "rlbt", "rltb", "tblr", or "tbrl" - the first two letters
            determine the column order while the second two letters determine the row order.  "bt"  is
            bottom-to-top, "lr" is left-to-right, "rl" is right-to-left, and "tb" is top-to-bottom.

       -o orientation-requested=4
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise).

       -o orientation-requested=5
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees clockwise).

       -o orientation-requested=6
            Prints the job in reverse portrait (rotated 180 degrees).

       -o outputorder=reverse
            Prints pages in reverse order.

       -o page-border=border
            Prints  a  border  around each document page.  "border" is "double", "double-thick", "sin‐
            gle", or "single-thick".

       -o page-ranges=page-list
            Specifies which pages to print in the document.  The list can contain a  list  of  numbers
            and  ranges  (#-#)  separated  by commas, e.g., "1,3-5,16".  The page numbers refer to the
            output pages and not the document's original pages - options like "number-up"  can  affect
            the numbering of the pages.

       -o sides=one-sided
            Prints on one side of the paper.

       -o sides=two-sided-long-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for portrait output.

       -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for landscape output.

NOTES
       The  -c,  -d,  -f,  -g,  -i, -n, -t, -v, and -w options are not supported by CUPS and produce a
       warning message if used.

EXAMPLES
       Print two copies of a document to the default printer:

           lpr -# 2 filename

       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":

           lpr -P foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print a presentation document 2-up to a printer called "foo":

           lpr -P foo -o number-up=2 filename
