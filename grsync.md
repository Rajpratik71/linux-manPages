NAME
       GRSYNC - GTK+ frontend for rsync

SYNOPSIS
       grsync [-e] [-s] [session_name]

       grsync -i session_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       GRSYNC  is  a graphical interface using GTK2 for the rsync command line program.  It currently supports the most important rsync features and can be used effectively for local directory synchro‐
       nization.

OPTIONS
       You can specify a session to load instead of the default one, by typing it as a command line option.  The "-e" commandline option automatically executes the session and closes grsync  when  fin‐
       ished, unless an error has been encountered.  You can have grsync stay open anyway using the "-s" option (even if the session run has been successfull).

       The alternative syntax, using the "-i" switch, will open the "import session" dialog on the file you specified as argument.
