NAME
       dh_pypy - calculates PyPy dependencies, adds maintainer scripts to byte compile files, etc.

SYNOPSIS
          dh_pypy -p PACKAGE [-V [X.Y][-][A.B]] DIR [-X REGEXPR]

DESCRIPTION
   QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
          · build-depend on pypy and dh-python,

          · add ${pypy:Depends} to Depends

          · build module/application using its standard build system,

          · install files to the standard locations,

          · add pypy to dh's --with option, or:

          · call dh_pypy in the binary-* target,

   NOTES
   dependencies
       dh_pypy  tries  to  translate  Python dependencies from the requires.txt file to Debian dependencies. In many cases, this works without any
       additional configuration because dh_pypy comes with a build-in mapping of Python module names  to  Debian  packages  that  is  periodically
       regenerated  from  the  Debian archive. By default, the version information in the Python dependencies is discarded. If you want dh_pypy to
       generate more strict dependencies (e.g. to avoid ABI problems), or if the automatic mapping does not work correctly for your  package,  you
       have to provide dh_pypy with additional rules for the translation of Python module to Debian package dependencies.

       For a package pypy-foo that depends on a package pypy-bar, there are two files that may provide such rules:

       1. If the pypy-foo source package ships with a debian/pypy-overrides file, this file is used by dh_pypy during the build of pypy-foo.

       2. If  the  pypy-bar  source  package ships with a debian/pypy-bar.pydist file (and uses dh_pypy), this file will be included in the binary
          package as /usr/share/dh-python/dist/pypy/pypy-bar. During the build of pypy-foo, dh_pypy will then find and use the file.

       Both files have the same format described in /usr/share/doc/dh-python/README.PyDist. If all you want is to generate versioned  dependencies
       (and  assuming  that  the  pypy-bar  package  provides  the pybar Python module), in most cases it will be sufficient to put the line pybar
       pypy-bar; PEP386 into either of the above files.

   private dirs
       /usr/share/foo, /usr/share/games/foo, /usr/lib/foo and /usr/lib/games/foo private directories are  scanned  for  Python  files  by  default
       (where  foo  is  binary  package  name).  If  your  package  is  shipping Python files in some other directory, add another dh_pypy call in
       debian/rules with directory name as an argument - you can use different set of options in this call. If you need to change  options  for  a
       private  directory that is checked by default, invoke dh_pypy with --skip-private option and add another call with a path to this directory
       and new options.

   debug packages
       In binary packages which name ends with -dbg, all files in /usr/lib/pypy/dist-packages/ directory that have extensions different than so or
       h are removed by default. Use --no-dbg-cleaning option to disable this feature.

   overriding supported / default PyPy versions
       If  you  want  to  override system's list of supported PyPy versions or the default one (f.e. to build a package that includes symlinks for
       older version of PyPy or  compile  .py  files  only  for  given  interpreter  version),  you  can  do  that  via  DEBPYPY_SUPPORTED  and/or
       DEBPYPY_DEFAULT env. variables.

       -v, --verbose
              turn verbose mode on

       -i, --indep
              act on architecture independent packages

       -a, --arch
              act on architecture dependent packages
