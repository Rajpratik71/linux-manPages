NAME
       nfc-relay - Relay attack command line tool based on libnfc

SYNOPSIS
       nfc-relay

DESCRIPTION
       nfc-relay is a utility that demonstrates a relay attack.

       This  tool  requires  two  NFC devices. One device (configured as target) will emulate an ISO/IEC 14443 type A tag, while the second device
       (configured as initiator) will act as a reader. The genuine tag can be placed on the second device (initiator) and the tag  emulator  (tar‚Äê
       get) can be placed close to the original reader. All communication is now relayed and shown in the screen on real-time.

       This  tool  has  the same issues regarding timing as nfc-emulate-uid has, therefore we advise you to try it against e.g. an OmniKey CardMan
       5321 reader.
