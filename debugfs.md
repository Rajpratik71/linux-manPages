DEBUGFS(8)                 System Manager's Manual                 DEBUGFS(8)

NAME
       debugfs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system debugger

SYNOPSIS
       debugfs [ -DVwcin ] [ -b blocksize ] [ -s superblock ] [ -f cmd_file ]
       [ -R request ] [ -d data_source_device ] [ -z undo_file ] [ device ]

DESCRIPTION
       The debugfs program is an interactive file system debugger. It can  be
       used  to  examine  and change the state of an ext2, ext3, or ext4 file
       system.

       device is a block device (e.g., /dev/sdXX) or a  file  containing  the
       file system.

OPTIONS
       -w     Specifies  that  the file system should be opened in read-write
              mode.  Without this option, the file system is opened in  read-
              only mode.

       -n     Disables  metadata  checksum verification.  This should only be
              used if you believe the metadata to be correct despite the com‐
              plaints of e2fsprogs.

       -c     Specifies that the file system should be opened in catastrophic
              mode, in which the inode and group bitmaps are  not  read  ini‐
              tially.   This  can  be useful for filesystems with significant
              corruption, but because of this, catastrophic mode  forces  the
              filesystem to be opened read-only.

       -i     Specifies  that device represents an ext2 image file created by
              the e2image program.  Since the ext2 image file  only  contains
              the superblock, block group descriptor, block and inode alloca‐
              tion bitmaps, and the inode table, many debugfs  commands  will
              not function properly.  Warning: no safety checks are in place,
              and debugfs may fail in interesting ways if  commands  such  as
              ls,    dump,    etc.   are   tried   without   specifying   the
              data_source_device using the -d option.  debugfs is a debugging
              tool.  It has rough edges!

       -d data_source_device
              Used  with  the  -i  option,  specifies that data_source_device
              should be used when reading blocks not found in the ext2  image
              file.  This includes data, directory, and indirect blocks.

       -b blocksize
              Forces  the use of the given block size (in bytes) for the file
              system, rather than detecting the correct block size  automati‐
              cally.   (This  option  is  rarely needed; it is used primarily
              when the file system is extremely badly damaged/corrupted.)

       -s superblock
              Causes the file system superblock to be  read  from  the  given
              block  number, instead of using the primary superblock (located
              at an offset of 1024 bytes from the beginning of  the  filesys‐
              tem).   If you specify the -s option, you must also provide the
              blocksize of the filesystem via the -b option.    (This  option
              is  rarely needed; it is used primarily when the file system is
              extremely badly damaged/corrupted.)

       -f cmd_file
              Causes debugfs to read in commands from cmd_file,  and  execute
              them.   When  debugfs  is finished executing those commands, it
              will exit.

       -D     Causes debugfs to open the device using Direct  I/O,  bypassing
              the buffer cache.  Note that some Linux devices, notably device
              mapper as of this writing, do not support Direct I/O.

       -R request
              Causes debugfs to execute the single command request, and  then
              exit.

       -V     print the version number of debugfs and exit.

       -z undo_file
              Before  overwriting a file system block, write the old contents
              of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can be used  with
              e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the file system should
              something go wrong.  If the  empty  string  is  passed  as  the
              undo_file  argument,  the  undo  file will be written to a file
              named debugfs-device.e2undo in the directory specified via  the
              E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR environment variable.

              WARNING:  The  undo file cannot be used to recover from a power
              or system crash.

SPECIFYING FILES
       Many debugfs commands take a filespec as an  argument  to  specify  an
       inode  (as opposed to a pathname) in the filesystem which is currently
       opened by debugfs.  The filespec argument  may  be  specified  in  two
       forms.   The  first form is an inode number surrounded by angle brack‐
       ets, e.g., <2>.  The second form is a pathname;  if  the  pathname  is
       prefixed  by a forward slash ('/'), then it is interpreted relative to
       the root of the filesystem which is currently opened by  debugfs.   If
       not,  the  pathname  is  interpreted  relative  to the current working
       directory as maintained by debugfs.  This may be modified by using the
       debugfs command cd.

COMMANDS
       This is a list of the commands which debugfs supports.

       blocks filespec
              Print the blocks used by the inode filespec to stdout.

       bmap [ -a ] filespec logical_block [physical_block]
              Print  or  set  the  physical block number corresponding to the
              logical block number logical_block in the inode  filespec.   If
              the -a flag is specified, try to allocate a block if necessary.

       block_dump [-f filespec] block_num
              Dump  the  filesystem block given by block_num in hex and ASCII
              format to the console.  If the  -f  option  is  specified,  the
              block number is relative to the start of the given filespec.

       cat filespec
              Dump the contents of the inode filespec to stdout.

       cd filespec
              Change the current working directory to filespec.

       chroot filespec
              Change the root directory to be the directory filespec.

       close [-a]
              Close  the  currently  open  file  system.  If the -a option is
              specified, write out any changes to the  superblock  and  block
              group descriptors to all of the backup superblocks, not just to
              the master superblock.

       clri filespec
              Clear the contents of the inode filespec.

       copy_inode source_inode destination_inode
              Copy the contents of the inode structure  in  source_inode  and
              use it to overwrite the inode structure at destination_inode.

       dirsearch filespec filename
              Search the directory filespec for filename.

       dirty [-clean]
              Mark  the  filesystem as dirty, so that the superblocks will be
              written on exit.  Additionally, clear  the  superblock's  valid
              flag, or set it if -clean is specified.

       dump [-p] filespec out_file
              Dump  the  contents  of  the  inode filespec to the output file
              out_file.  If the -p option is given set the owner,  group  and
              permissions information on out_file to match filespec.

       dump_mmp [mmp_block]
              Display  the  multiple-mount protection (mmp) field values.  If
              mmp_block is specified then verify and dump the MMP values from
              the  given block number, otherwise use the s_mmp_block field in
              the superblock to locate and use the existing MMP block.

       dx_hash [-h hash_alg] [-s hash_seed] filename
              Calculate the directory hash of filename.  The  hash  algorithm
              specified  with  -h  may be legacy, half_md4, or tea.  The hash
              seed specified with -s must be in UUID format.

       dump_extents [-n] [-l] filespec
              Dump the the extent tree of the inode filespec.   The  -n  flag
              will  cause  dump_extents to only display the interior nodes in
              the extent tree.   The -l flag will cause dump_extents to  only
              display the leaf nodes in the extent tree.

              (Please  note  that the length and range of blocks for the last
              extent in an interior  node  is  an  estimate  by  the  extents
              library  functions, and is not stored in filesystem data struc‐
              tures.   Hence, the values displayed  may  not  necessarily  by
              accurate  and  does not indicate a problem or corruption in the
              file system.)

       dump_unused
              Dump unused blocks which contain non-null bytes.

       ea_get [-f outfile]|[-xVC] [-r] filespec attr_name
              Retrieve the value of the extended attribute attr_name  in  the
              file filespec and write it either to stdout or to outfile.

       ea_list filespec
              List  the extended attributes associated with the file filespec
              to standard output.

       ea_set [-f infile] [-r] filespec attr_name attr_value
              Set the value of the extended attribute attr_name in  the  file
              filespec to the string value attr_value or read it from infile.

       ea_rm filespec attr_names...
              Remove the extended attribute attr_name from the file filespec.

       expand_dir filespec
              Expand the directory filespec.

       fallocate filespec start_block [end_block]
              Allocate  and  map  uninitialized  blocks into filespec between
              logical  block  start_block  and  end_block,   inclusive.    If
              end_block is not supplied, this function maps until it runs out
              of free disk blocks  or  the  maximum  file  size  is  reached.
              Existing mappings are left alone.

       feature [fs_feature] [-fs_feature] ...
              Set  or  clear  various  filesystem features in the superblock.
              After setting or clearing any  filesystem  features  that  were
              requested,  print  the  current state of the filesystem feature
              set.

       filefrag [-dvr] filespec
              Print the number of contiguous extents in filespec.   If  file‐
              spec  is  a directory and the -d option is not specified, file‐
              frag will print the number of contiguous extents for each  file
              in  the  directory.   The -v option will cause filefrag print a
              tabular listing of the contiguous extents in the file.  The  -r
              option  will  cause  filefrag  to do a recursive listing of the
              directory.

       find_free_block [count [goal]]
              Find the first count free blocks, starting from goal and  allo‐
              cate it.  Also available as ffb.

       find_free_inode [dir [mode]]
              Find  a  free inode and allocate it.  If present, dir specifies
              the inode number of the directory which  the  inode  is  to  be
              located.   The second optional argument mode specifies the per‐
              missions of the new inode.  (If the directory bit is set on the
              mode,  the allocation routine will function differently.)  Also
              available as ffi.

       freeb block [count]
              Mark the block number block as not allocated.  If the  optional
              argument  count is present, then count blocks starting at block
              number block will be marked as not allocated.

       freefrag [-c chunk_kb]
              Report free space fragmentation on the currently open file sys‐
              tem.   If  the -c option is specified then the filefrag command
              will print how many free chunks of size chunk_kb can  be  found
              in  the file system.  The chunk size must be a power of two and
              be larger than the file system block size.

       freei filespec [num]
              Free the inode specified by filespec.   If  num  is  specified,
              also clear num-1 inodes after the specified inode.

       get_quota quota_type id
              Display quota information for given quota type (user, group, or
              project) and ID.

       help   Print a list of commands understood by debugfs.

       htree_dump filespec
              Dump the hash-indexed  directory  filespec,  showing  its  tree
              structure.

       icheck block ...
              Print  a listing of the inodes which use the one or more blocks
              specified on the command line.

       inode_dump filespec
              Print the contents of the inode data structure in hex and ASCII
              format.

       imap filespec
              Print  the  location  of the inode data structure (in the inode
              table) of the inode filespec.

       init_filesys device blocksize
              Create an ext2 file system on device with  device  size  block‐
              size.  Note that this does not fully initialize all of the data
              structures; to do this, use the  mke2fs(8)  program.   This  is
              just  a  call  to  the  low-level  library,  which  sets up the
              superblock and block descriptors.

       journal_close
              Close the open journal.

       journal_open [-c] [-v ver] [-f ext_jnl]
              Opens the journal for reading and writing.   Journal  checksum‐
              ming  can  be enabled by supplying -c; checksum formats 2 and 3
              can be selected with the -v option.  An external journal can be
              loaded from ext_jnl.

       journal_run
              Replay all transactions in the open journal.

       journal_write [-b blocks] [-r revoke] [-c] file
              Write a transaction to the open journal.  The list of blocks to
              write should be supplied as a comma-separated list  in  blocks;
              the  blocks themselves should be readable from file.  A list of
              blocks to revoke can be supplied as a comma-separated  list  in
              revoke.  By default, a commit record is written at the end; the
              -c switch writes an uncommitted transaction.

       kill_file filespec
              Deallocate the inode filespec and its blocks.  Note  that  this
              does  not  remove any directory entries (if any) to this inode.
              See the rm(1) command if you wish to unlink a file.

       lcd directory
              Change the current working directory of the debugfs process  to
              directory on the native filesystem.

       list_quota quota_type
              Display quota information for given quota type (user, group, or
              project).

       ln filespec dest_file
              Create a link named dest_file which is a hard link to filespec.
              Note this does not adjust the inode reference counts.

       logdump  [-acsOS]  [-b  block]  [-i  filespec] [-f journal_file] [out‐
       put_file]
              Dump the contents of the ext3 journal.  By  default,  dump  the
              journal  inode  as  specified in the superblock.  However, this
              can be overridden with the -i option, which dumps  the  journal
              from the internal inode given by filespec.  A regular file con‐
              taining journal data can be  specified  using  the  -f  option.
              Finally,  the  -s option utilizes the backup information in the
              superblock to locate the journal.

              The -S option causes logdump to print the contents of the jour‐
              nal superblock.

              The  -a option causes the logdump program to print the contents
              of all of the descriptor blocks.  The -b option causes  logdump
              to print all journal records that refer to the specified block.
              The -c option will print out the contents of all  of  the  data
              blocks selected by the -a and -b options.

              The  -O  option  causes  logdump  to display old (checkpointed)
              journal entries.  This can be used to try to track down journal
              problems even after the journal has been replayed.

       ls [-l] [-c] [-d] [-p] [-r] filespec
              Print a listing of the files in the directory filespec.  The -c
              flag causes directory block checksums (if present) to  be  dis‐
              played.   The  -d  flag will list deleted entries in the direc‐
              tory.  The -l flag will list files using a more verbose format.
              The  -p flag will list the files in a format which is more eas‐
              ily parsable by scripts, as well as making it more  clear  when
              there are spaces or other non-printing characters at the end of
              filenames.  The -r flag will force the printing  of  the  file‐
              name, even if it is encrypted.

       list_deleted_inodes [limit]
              List deleted inodes, optionally limited to those deleted within
              limit seconds ago.  Also available as lsdel.

              This command was useful for  recovering  from  accidental  file
              deletions for ext2 file systems.  Unfortunately, it is not use‐
              ful for this purpose if the files were deleted  using  ext3  or
              ext4,  since  the  inode's  data blocks are no longer available
              after the inode is released.

       modify_inode filespec
              Modify the contents of the inode structure in the  inode  file‐
              spec.  Also available as mi.

       mkdir filespec
              Make a directory.

       mknod filespec [p|[[c|b] major minor]]
              Create  a special device file (a named pipe, character or block
              device).  If a character or block device is  to  be  made,  the
              major and minor device numbers must be specified.

       ncheck [-c] inode_num ...
              Take  the  requested list of inode numbers, and print a listing
              of pathnames to those inodes.  The -c flag will enable checking
              the  file  type information in the directory entry to make sure
              it matches the inode's type.

       open [-weficD] [-b blocksize] [-d image_filename] [-s superblock]  [-z
       undo_file] device
              Open a filesystem for editing.  The -f flag forces the filesys‐
              tem to be opened even if there are some unknown or incompatible
              filesystem features which would normally prevent the filesystem
              from being opened.  The -e flag causes  the  filesystem  to  be
              opened  in  exclusive mode.  The -b, -c, -d, -i, -s, -w, and -D
              options behave the same as the command-line options to debugfs.

       punch filespec start_blk [end_blk]
              Delete the blocks  in  the  inode  ranging  from  start_blk  to
              end_blk.  If end_blk is omitted then this command will function
              as a truncate command; that is, all of the blocks  starting  at
              start_blk through to the end of the file will be deallocated.

       symlink filespec target
              Make a symbolic link.

       pwd    Print the current working directory.

       quit   Quit debugfs

       rdump directory[...] destination
              Recursively  dump  directory,  or multiple directories, and all
              its contents (including  regular  files,  symbolic  links,  and
              other  directories) into the named destination, which should be
              an existing directory on the native filesystem.

       rm pathname
              Unlink pathname.  If this causes the inode pointed to by  path‐
              name  to  have  no other references, deallocate the file.  This
              command functions as the unlink() system call.

       rmdir filespec
              Remove the directory filespec.

       setb block [count]
              Mark the block number block  as  allocated.   If  the  optional
              argument  count is present, then count blocks starting at block
              number block will be marked as allocated.

       set_block_group bgnum field value
              Modify the block group descriptor specified by  bgnum  so  that
              the  block  group descriptor field field has value value.  Also
              available as set_bg.

       set_current_time time
              Set current time in seconds since Unix epoch to use  when  set‐
              ting filesystem fields.

       seti filespec [num]
              Mark  inode  filespec as in use in the inode bitmap.  If num is
              specified, also set num-1 inodes after the specified inode.

       set_inode_field filespec field value
              Modify the inode specified by filespec so that the inode  field
              field  has  value  value.  The list of valid inode fields which
              can be set via this command can be displayed by using the  com‐
              mand: set_inode_field -l Also available as sif.

       set_mmp_value field value
              Modify the multiple-mount protection (MMP) data so that the MMP
              field field has value value.  The  list  of  valid  MMP  fields
              which can be set via this command can be displayed by using the
              command: set_mmp_value -l Also available as smmp.

       set_super_value field value
              Set the superblock field field to value.   The  list  of  valid
              superblock fields which can be set via this command can be dis‐
              played by using the command: set_super_value -l Also  available
              as ssv.

       show_debugfs_params
              Display  debugfs parameters such as information about currently
              opened filesystem.

       show_super_stats [-h]
              List the contents of  the  super  block  and  the  block  group
              descriptors.   If  the  -h  flag  is  given, only print out the
              superblock contents. Also available as stats.

       stat filespec
              Display the contents of the inode structure of the inode  file‐
              spec.

       supported_features
              Display  filesystem  features  supported  by  this  version  of
              debugfs.

       testb block [count]
              Test if the block number block is marked as  allocated  in  the
              block  bitmap.  If the optional argument count is present, then
              count blocks starting at block number block will be tested.

       testi filespec
              Test if the inode filespec is marked as allocated in the  inode
              bitmap.

       undel <inode_number> [pathname]
              Undelete  the  specified inode number (which must be surrounded
              by angle brackets) so that it and its blocks are marked in use,
              and  optionally link the recovered inode to the specified path‐
              name.  The e2fsck command should always be run after using  the
              undel command to recover deleted files.

              Note  that  if  you  are  recovering  a large number of deleted
              files, linking the inode to a directory may require the  direc‐
              tory to be expanded, which could allocate a block that had been
              used by one of the yet-to-be-undeleted files.  So it  is  safer
              to  undelete all of the inodes without specifying a destination
              pathname, and then in a separate pass,  use  the  debugfs  link
              command  to  link the inode to the destination pathname, or use
              e2fsck to check the filesystem and link all  of  the  recovered
              inodes to the lost+found directory.

       unlink pathname
              Remove  the  link specified by pathname to an inode.  Note this
              does not adjust the inode reference counts.

       write source_file out_file
              Copy the contents of source_file into a newly-created  file  in
              the filesystem named out_file.

       zap_block [-f filespec] [-o offset] [-l length] [-p pattern] block_num
              Overwrite  the  block  specified  by  block_num with zero (NUL)
              bytes, or if -p is given use the byte specified by pattern.  If
              -f is given then block_num is relative to the start of the file
              given by filespec.  The -o and -l options limit  the  range  of
              bytes to zap to the specified offset and length relative to the
              start of the block.

       zap_block [-f filespec] [-b bit] block_num
              Bit-flip portions of the physical block_num.  If -f  is  given,
              then  block_num  is  a  logical  block relative to the start of
              filespec.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBUGFS_PAGER, PAGER
              The debugfs program always pipes the output of  the  some  com‐
              mands   through  a  pager  program.   These  commands  include:
              show_super_stats (stats), list_directory (ls),  show_inode_info
              (stat),  list_deleted_inodes (lsdel), and htree_dump.  The spe‐
              cific pager can explicitly specified by the DEBUGFS_PAGER envi‐
              ronment  variable,  and if it is not set, by the PAGER environ‐
              ment variable.

              Note that since a pager is always used, the  less(1)  pager  is
              not particularly appropriate, since it clears the screen before
              displaying the output of the command and clears the output  the
              screen  when the pager is exited.  Many users prefer to use the
              less(1) pager for most purposes, which is why the DEBUGFS_PAGER
              environment  variable is available to override the more general
              PAGER environment variable.
