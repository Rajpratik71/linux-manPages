NAME
       checkgid - checks the gid

SYNOPSIS
       checkgid group

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the checkgid command.

       checkgid is a program that checks whether it can setgid to the group specified. This is to see if it is a valid group for apache2 to use at
       runtime.  If the user (should be run as superuser) is in that group, or can setgid to it, it will return 0.
