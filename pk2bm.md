NAME
       pk2bm - create a bitmap from a TeX pkfont

SYNOPSIS:
       pk2bm [-bh] [-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -cchar pkfont

       pk2bm [-bh] [-Wwidth] [-Hheight] -ooctchar pkfont

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  generates  a  bitmap (ASCII file) which can be used to create X11 applications. The bitmap file consists of all pixels of the specified character (via the -c or -o
       option) from the given pkfont. The format is described in bitmap(X11).

       The pkfont is a packed fontfile generated by gftopk(TeX) from a gffont. A gffont is the output of METAFONT a program to design fonts in a device independant way.

       With the -b flag a bitmap is generated in which all black pixels are drawn as a `*' and all white bits as a `.'. With the -h flag a hexadecimal bitmap dump is generated.

       The -W and/or -H options can be used to create a bitmap of respectivally `width' and `height' pixels. The pk-bitmap will in this case be centered according to  these  new  dimen‚Äê
       sions.

       The output is written to the standard output.
