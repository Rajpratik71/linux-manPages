NAME
       speech-dispatcher - server process managing speech requests in Speech Dispatcher

SYNOPSIS
       speech-dispatcher [-{d|s}] [-l {1|2|3|4|5}] [-c com_method] [-S socket_path] [-p port] | [-v] | [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       speech-dispatcher  is  a  server  process  that  is  responsible  for transforming requests for text-to-speech output into actual speech hearable in the speakers. It arbitrates concurrent speech
       requests based on message priorities, and abstracts different speech synthesizers. Client programs, like screen readers or navigation software, send speech requests  to  speech-dispatcher  using
       TCP  protocol (with the help of client libraries).  speech-dispatcher is usually started automatically by client libraries (i.e. autospawn), so you only need to run it manually if testing/debug‚Äê
       ging, or when in other explicit need for a special setup.
