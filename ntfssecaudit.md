NAME
       ntfssecaudit - NTFS Security Data Auditing

SYNOPSIS
       ntfssecaudit [options] args

       Where options is a combination of :
              -a full auditing of security data (Linux only)
              -b backup ACLs
              -e setting extra backed-up parameters (in conjunction with -s)
              -h displaying hexadecimal security descriptors saved in a file
              -r recursing in a directory
              -s setting backed-up ACLs
              -u getting a user mapping proposal
              -v verbose (very verbose if set twice)

       and args define the parameters and the set of files acted upon.

       Typing  secaudit  with  no  args  will  display a summary of available
       options.

DESCRIPTION
       ntfssecaudit displays the ownership and permissions of a set of  files
       on  an  NTFS  file  system,  and  checks  their consistency. It can be
       started in terminal mode only (no graphical user interface  is  avail‐
       able.)

       When a volume is required, it has to be unmounted, and the command has
       to be issued as root. The volume can be either a block device (i.e.  a
       disk partition) or an image file.

       When acting on a directory or volume, the command may produce a lot of
       information. It is therefore advisable to redirect  the  output  to  a
       file or pipe it to a text editor for examination.

OPTIONS
       Below are the valid combinations of options and arguments that ntfsse‐
       caudit accepts. All the indicated arguments are mandatory and must  be
       unique (if wildcards are used, they must resolve to a single name.)

       -h file
              Displays  in  an  human  readable form the hexadecimal security
              descriptors saved in file. This can be used to turn  a  verbose
              output into a very verbose output.

       -a[rv] volume
              Audits  the volume : all the global security data on volume are
              scanned and errors are displayed. If option -r is present,  all
              files  and  directories are also scanned and their relations to
              global security data are checked. This can  produce  a  lot  of
              data.

              This  option is not effective on volumes formatted for old NTFS
              versions (pre NTFS 3.0). Such volumes have no  global  security
              data.

              When errors are signalled, it is advisable to repair the volume
              with an appropriate tool (such as chkdsk on Windows.)

       [-v] volume file
              Displays the security parameters  of  file  :  its  interpreted
              Linux  mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its security
              key if any, and its security descriptor if verbose output.

       -r[v] volume directory
              displays the security parameters of all files  and  subdirecto‐
              ries  in directory : their interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags in
              octal) and Posix ACL[1], their security key if any,  and  their
              security descriptor if verbose output.

       -b[v] volume [directory]
              Recursively  extracts to standard output the NTFS ACLs of files
              in volume and directory.

       -s[ev] volume [backup-file]
              Sets the NTFS ACLS as  indicated  in  backup-file  or  standard
              input.  The  input  data  must have been created on Linux. With
              option  -e,  also  sets  extra  parameters  (currently  Windows
              attrib).

       volume perms file
              Sets  the  security  parameters  of file to perms. Perms is the
              Linux requested mode (rwx flags, expressed in octal form as  in
              chmod)  or  a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like in setfacl -m). This
              sets a new ACL which is effective for Linux and Windows.

       -r[v] volume perms directory
              Sets the security parameters of all files and subdirectories in
              directory  to  perms.  Perms  is  the Linux requested mode (rwx
              flags, expressed in octal form as in chmod), or a Posix  ACL[1]
              (expressed  like  in  setfacl -m.) This sets new ACLs which are
              effective for Linux and Windows.

       [-v] mounted-file
              Displays the security parameters of mounted-file :  its  inter‐
              preted  Linux  mode  (rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its
              security key if any, and its  security  descriptor  if  verbose
              output. This is a special case which acts on a mounted file (or
              directory) and does not  require  being  root.  The  Posix  ACL
              interpretation  can  only  be  displayed  if  the  full path to
              mounted-file from the root of the global file tree is provided.

       -u[v] mounted-file
              Displays a proposed contents for a user mapping file, based  on
              the ownership parameters set by Windows on mounted-file, assum‐
              ing this file was created on Windows by the user who should  be
              mapped to the current Linux user. The displayed information has
              to be copied to the file .NTFS-3G/UserMapping where .NTFS-3G is
              a  hidden  subdirectory  of the root of the partition for which
              the mapping is to be defined. This will cause the ownership  of
              files  created on that partition to be the same as the original
              mounted-file.

NOTE
       [1] provided the POSIX ACL option was  selected  at  compile  time.  A
       Posix ACL specification looks like "[d:]{ugmo}:[id]:[perms],..." where
       id is a numeric user or group id, and perms an octal digit  or  a  set
       from the letters r, w and x.
              Example : "u::7,g::5,o:0,u:510:rwx,g:500:5,d:u:510:7"

EXAMPLES
       Audit the global security data on /dev/sda1

              ntfssecaudit -ar /dev/sda1

       Display  the  ownership and permissions parameters for files in direc‐
       tory /audio/music on device /dev/sda5, excluding sub-directories :

              ntfssecaudit /dev/sda5 /audio/music

       Set all files in directory /audio/music on device /dev/sda5 as  write‐
       able by owner and read-only for everybody :

              ntfssecaudit -r /dev/sda5 644 /audio/music

EXIT CODES
       ntfssecaudit  exits  with a value of 0 when no error was detected, and
       with a value of 1 when an error was detected.
