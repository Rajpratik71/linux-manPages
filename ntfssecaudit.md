NAME
       ntfssecaudit - NTFS Security Data Auditing

SYNOPSIS
       ntfssecaudit [options] args

       Where options is a combination of :
              -a full auditing of security data (Linux only)
              -b backup ACLs
              -e setting extra backed-up parameters (in conjunction with -s)
              -h displaying hexadecimal security descriptors saved in a file
              -r recursing in a directory
              -s setting backed-up ACLs
              -u getting a user mapping proposal
              -v verbose (very verbose if set twice)

       and args define the parameters and the set of files acted upon.

       Typing secaudit with no args will display a summary of available options.

DESCRIPTION
       ntfssecaudit  displays  the ownership and permissions of a set of files on an NTFS file system,
       and checks their consistency. It can be started in terminal mode only (no graphical user inter‐
       face is available.)

       When  a  volume  is required, it has to be unmounted, and the command has to be issued as root.
       The volume can be either a block device (i.e. a disk partition) or an image file.

       When acting on a directory or volume, the command may produce  a  lot  of  information.  It  is
       therefore  advisable  to redirect the output to a file or pipe it to a text editor for examina‐
       tion.

OPTIONS
       Below are the valid combinations of options and arguments that ntfssecaudit  accepts.  All  the
       indicated  arguments are mandatory and must be unique (if wildcards are used, they must resolve
       to a single name.)

       -h file
              Displays in an human readable form the hexadecimal security descriptors saved  in  file.
              This can be used to turn a verbose output into a very verbose output.

       -a[rv] volume
              Audits  the  volume  : all the global security data on volume are scanned and errors are
              displayed. If option -r is present, all files and directories are also scanned and their
              relations to global security data are checked. This can produce a lot of data.

              This  option is not effective on volumes formatted for old NTFS versions (pre NTFS 3.0).
              Such volumes have no global security data.

              When errors are signalled, it is advisable to repair the volume with an appropriate tool
              (such as chkdsk on Windows.)

       [-v] volume file
              Displays  the security parameters of file : its interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags in oc‐
              tal) and Posix ACL[1], its security key if any, and its security descriptor  if  verbose
              output.

       -r[v] volume directory
              displays  the  security  parameters of all files and subdirectories in directory : their
              interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags in octal) and Posix ACL[1], their security key if any,
              and their security descriptor if verbose output.

       -b[v] volume [directory]
              Recursively extracts to standard output the NTFS ACLs of files in volume and directory.

       -s[ev] volume [backup-file]
              Sets  the  NTFS  ACLS as indicated in backup-file or standard input. The input data must
              have been created on Linux. With option -e, also sets extra parameters  (currently  Win‐
              dows attrib).

       volume perms file
              Sets  the  security  parameters of file to perms. Perms is the Linux requested mode (rwx
              flags, expressed in octal form as in chmod) or a Posix ACL[1] (expressed like in setfacl
              -m). This sets a new ACL which is effective for Linux and Windows.

       -r[v] volume perms directory
              Sets  the  security  parameters  of  all files and subdirectories in directory to perms.
              Perms is the Linux requested mode (rwx flags, expressed in octal form as in chmod), or a
              Posix  ACL[1] (expressed like in setfacl -m.) This sets new ACLs which are effective for
              Linux and Windows.

       [-v] mounted-file
              Displays the security parameters of mounted-file : its interpreted Linux mode (rwx flags
              in octal) and Posix ACL[1], its security key if any, and its security descriptor if ver‐
              bose output. This is a special case which acts on a mounted file (or directory) and does
              not  require  being root. The Posix ACL interpretation can only be displayed if the full
              path to mounted-file from the root of the global file tree is provided.

       -u[v] mounted-file
              Displays a proposed contents for a user mapping file, based on the ownership  parameters
              set  by  Windows  on mounted-file, assuming this file was created on Windows by the user
              who should be mapped to the current Linux user. The  displayed  information  has  to  be
              copied  to  the file .NTFS-3G/UserMapping where .NTFS-3G is a hidden subdirectory of the
              root of the partition for which the mapping is to be defined. This will cause the owner‐
              ship of files created on that partition to be the same as the original mounted-file.

NOTE
       [1] provided the POSIX ACL option was selected at compile time. A Posix ACL specification looks
       like "[d:]{ugmo}:[id]:[perms],..." where id is a numeric user or group id, and perms  an  octal
       digit or a set from the letters r, w and x.
              Example : "u::7,g::5,o:0,u:510:rwx,g:500:5,d:u:510:7"

EXAMPLES
       Audit the global security data on /dev/sda1

              ntfssecaudit -ar /dev/sda1

       Display  the ownership and permissions parameters for files in directory /audio/music on device
       /dev/sda5, excluding sub-directories :

              ntfssecaudit /dev/sda5 /audio/music

       Set all files in directory /audio/music on device /dev/sda5 as writeable by owner and read-only
       for everybody :

              ntfssecaudit -r /dev/sda5 644 /audio/music

EXIT CODES
       ntfssecaudit  exits with a value of 0 when no error was detected, and with a value of 1 when an
       error was detected.
