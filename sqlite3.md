SQLITE3(1)                                                    General Commands Manual                                                   SQLITE3(1)

NAME
       sqlite3 - A command line interface for SQLite version 3

SYNOPSIS
       sqlite3 [options] [databasefile] [SQL]

SUMMARY
       sqlite3  is  a  terminal-based  front-end to the SQLite library that can evaluate queries interactively and display the results in multiple
       formats.  sqlite3 can also be used within shell scripts and other applications to provide batch processing features.

DESCRIPTION
       To start a sqlite3 interactive session, invoke the sqlite3 command and optionally provide the name of a database  file.   If  the  database
       file does not exist, it will be created.  If the database file does exist, it will be opened.

       For example, to create a new database file named "mydata.db", create a table named "memos" and insert a couple of records into that table:

       $ sqlite3 mydata.db
       SQLite version 3.8.8
       Enter ".help" for instructions
       sqlite> create table memos(text, priority INTEGER);
       sqlite> insert into memos values('deliver project description', 10);
       sqlite> insert into memos values('lunch with Christine', 100);
       sqlite> select * from memos;
       deliver project description|10
       lunch with Christine|100
       sqlite>

       If no database name is supplied, the ATTACH sql command can be used to attach to existing or create new database files.  ATTACH can also be
       used to attach to multiple databases within the same interactive session.  This is useful for migrating data  between  databases,  possibly
       changing the schema along the way.

       Optionally,  a  SQL  statement  or  set of SQL statements can be supplied as a single argument.  Multiple statements should be separated by
       semi-colons.

       For example:

       $ sqlite3 -line mydata.db 'select * from memos where priority > 20;'
           text = lunch with Christine
       priority = 100

   SQLITE META-COMMANDS
       The interactive interpreter offers a set of meta-commands that can be used to control the output format,  examine  the  currently  attached
       database  files,  or perform administrative operations upon the attached databases (such as rebuilding indices).   Meta-commands are always
       prefixed with a dot (.).

       A list of available meta-commands can be viewed at any time by issuing the '.help' command.  For example:

       sqlite> .help
       .backup ?DB? FILE      Backup DB (default "main") to FILE
       .bail on|off           Stop after hitting an error.  Default OFF

OPTIONS
       sqlite3 has the following options:

       -bail  Stop after hitting an error.

       -batch Force batch I/O.

       -column
              Query results will be displayed in a table like form, using whitespace characters to separate the columns and align the output.

       -cmd command
              run command before reading stdin

       -csv   Set output mode to CSV (comma separated values).

       -echo  Print commands before execution.

       -init file
              Read and execute commands from file , which can contain a mix of SQL statements and meta-commands.

       -[no]header
              Turn headers on or off.

       -help  Show help on options and exit.

       -html  Query results will be output as simple HTML tables.

       -interactive
              Force interactive I/O.

       -line  Query results will be displayed with one value per line, rows separated by a blank line.  Designed to be easily parsed by scripts or
              other programs

       -list  Query results will be displayed with the separator (|, by default) character between each field value.  The default.

       -mmap N
              Set default mmap size to N

       -vfs name
              Use name as the default VFS.

INIT FILE
       sqlite3  reads  an  initialization file to set the configuration of the interactive environment.  Throughout initialization, any previously
       specified setting can be overridden.  The sequence of initialization is as follows:

       o The default configuration is established as follows:

       mode            = LIST
       separator       = "|"
       main prompt     = "sqlite> "
       continue prompt = "   ...> "

       o If the file ~/.sqliterc exists, it is processed first.  can be found in the user's home directory, it is read and processed.   It  should
       generally only contain meta-commands.

       o If the -init option is present, the specified file is processed.

       o All other command line options are processed.
