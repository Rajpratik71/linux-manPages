NAME
       mount.ecryptfs - eCryptfs mount helper.

SYNOPSIS
       mount -t ecryptfs [lower directory] [ecryptfs mount point]

DESCRIPTION
       mount.ecryptfs  is  eCryptfs mount helper. The mount utility will defer to the mount helper to perform various configuration tasks; use the
       -i option to bypass the mount helper if you would rather manually specify your mount options. To mount eCryptfs, specify the  lower  direc‚Äê
       tory (i.e., /root/crypt) for the encrypted files and the eCryptfs mountpoint (i.e., /mnt/crypt) for the decrypted view of the files:

       mount -t ecryptfs /root/crypt /mnt/crypt
