NAME
       wrmsr - tool for writing CPU machine specific registers (MSR)

SYNOPSIS
       wrmsr [options] regno value

DESCRIPTION
       wrmsr is a tool used for writing values to a CPU's machine specific registers (MSR).
       Note: if you're running a Debian kernel, be sure that the msr.ko kernel module is loaded. 'mod‚Äê
       probe msr' should do the trick. Otherwise, you'll get an error about wrmsr not  being  able  to
       open files in /dev/cpu/...
