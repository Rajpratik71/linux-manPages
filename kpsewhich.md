DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file or manual Kpathsea: A library for path search‚Äê
       ing.

       kpsewhich is used as a standalone front-end of the kpathsea library that can be used to examine variables and find files.  When the -format option is not given, the  search  path
