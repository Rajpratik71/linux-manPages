       mknod - make block or character special files

SYNOPSIS
       mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

DESCRIPTION
       Create the special file NAME of the given TYPE.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

       -Z     set the SELinux security context to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Both  MAJOR  and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b, c, or u, and they must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x or 0X, it is interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it
       begins with 0, as octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of mknod, which usually supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
