NAME
       pinentry-gnome3 - PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG

SYNOPSIS
       pinentry-gnome3 [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       pinentry-gnome3  is  a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
       pass phrases.  That means it tries  to  take  care  that  the  entered
       information  is  not  swapped  to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
       This functionality is particularly useful for  entering  pass  phrases
       when  using  encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
       the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to  par‐
       ticular software.

       pinentry-gnome3  implements a PIN entry dialog based on GNOME 3, which
       aims to follow the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines as closely as pos‐
       sible.  If the X Window System is not active then an alternative text-
       mode dialog will be used.  There are other flavors that implement  PIN
       entry dialogs using other tool kits.

       pinentry-gnome3  is  typically  used  internally  by gpg-agent.  Users
       don't normally have a reason to call it directly.

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the program version and licensing information.

       --help Print a usage message summarizing the most useful  command-line
              options.

       --debug, -d
              Turn  on  some  debugging.   Mostly useful for the maintainers.
              Note that  this  may  reveal  sensitive  information  like  the
              entered pass phrase.

       --enhanced, -e
              Ask  for  timeouts  and insurance, too.  Note that this is cur‐
              rently not fully supported.

       --no-global-grab, -g
              Grab the keyboard only when the window is  focused.   Use  this
              option  if  you  are  debugging software using pinentry-gnome3;
              otherwise you may not be able to to access your X session  any‐
              more  (unless you have other means to connect to the machine to
              kill pinentry-gnome3).

       --parent-wid N
              Use window ID N as the parent window for positioning  the  win‐
              dow.   Note, that this is not fully supported by all flavors of
              pinentry.

       --display  STRING,  --ttyname  STRING,  --ttytype  STRING,   --lc-type
       STRING, --lc-messages STRING
              These  options  are  used  to  pass localization information to
              pinentry-gnome3.  They are required because pinentry-gnome3  is
              usually  called  by some background process which does not have
              any information on the locale and terminal to use.  Assuan pro‐
              tocol options are an alternative way to pass these information.
