NAME
       agetty - alternative Linux getty

SYNOPSIS
       agetty [options] port [baud_rate...] [term]

DESCRIPTION
       agetty opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the /bin/login command.  It is normally invoked by init(8).

       agetty has several non-standard features that are useful for hardwired and for dial-in lines:

       ·      Adapts  the  tty  settings  to parity bits and to erase, kill, end-of-line and uppercase characters when it reads a login name.  The
              program can handle 7-bit characters with even, odd, none or space parity, and 8-bit characters with no parity.  The  following  spe‐
              cial  characters are recognized: Control-U (kill); DEL and backspace (erase); carriage return and line feed (end of line).  See also
              the --erase-chars and --kill-chars options.

       ·      Optionally deduces the baud rate from the CONNECT messages produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.

       ·      Optionally does not hang up when it is given an already opened line (useful for call-back applications).

       ·      Optionally does not display the contents of the /etc/issue file.

       ·      Optionally displays an alternative issue file instead of /etc/issue.

       ·      Optionally does not ask for a login name.

       ·      Optionally invokes a non-standard login program instead of /bin/login.

       ·      Optionally turns on hardware flow control.

       ·      Optionally forces the line to be local with no need for carrier detect.

       This program does not use the /etc/gettydefs (System V) or /etc/gettytab (SunOS 4) files.

ARGUMENTS
       port   A path name relative to the /dev directory.  If a "-" is specified, agetty assumes that its standard input is already connected to a
              tty port and that a connection to a remote user has already been established.

              Under System V, a "-" port argument should be preceded by a "--".

       baud_rate,...
              A  comma-separated  list of one or more baud rates.  Each time agetty receives a BREAK character it advances through the list, which
              is treated as if it were circular.

              Baud rates should be specified in descending order, so that the null character (Ctrl-@) can also be used for baud-rate switching.

              This argument is optional and unnecessary for virtual terminals.

              The default for serial terminals is keep the current baud rate (see --keep-baud) and if unsuccessful then default to '9600'.

       term   The value to be used for the TERM environment variable.  This overrides whatever init(8) may have set, and is inherited by login and
              the shell.

              The default is 'vt100', or 'linux' for Linux on a virtual terminal, or 'hurd' for GNU Hurd on a virtual terminal.

OPTIONS
       -8, --8bits
              Assume that the tty is 8-bit clean, hence disable parity detection.

       -a, --autologin username
              Automatically  log  in the specified user without asking for a username or password.  Using this option causes an -f username option
              and argument to be added to the /bin/login command line.  See --login-options, which can be used to modify this option's behavior.

       -c, --noreset
              Do not reset terminal cflags (control modes).  See termios(3) for more details.

       -E, --remote
              Typically the login(1) command is given a remote hostname when called by something such as telnetd(8).  This option allows agetty to
              pass what it is using for a hostname to login(1) for use in utmp(5).  See --host, login(1), and utmp(5).

              If the --host fakehost option is given, then an -h fakehost option and argument are added to the /bin/login command line.

              If the --nohostname option is given, then an -H option is added to the /bin/login command line.

              See --login-options.

       -f, --issue-file issue_file
              Display  the contents of issue_file instead of /etc/issue.  This allows custom messages to be displayed on different terminals.  The
              --noissue option will override this option.

       -h, --flow-control
              Enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.  It is left up to the application to disable software (XON/XOFF) flow protocol where  appro‐
              priate.

       -H, --host fakehost
              Write the specified fakehost into the utmp file.  Normally, no login host is given, since agetty is used for local hardwired connec‐
              tions and consoles.  However, this option can be useful for identifying terminal concentrators and the like.

       -i, --noissue
              Do not display the contents of /etc/issue (or other) before writing the login prompt.   Terminals  or  communications  hardware  may
              become  confused when receiving lots of text at the wrong baud rate; dial-up scripts may fail if the login prompt is preceded by too
              much text.

       -I, --init-string initstring
              Set an initial string to be sent to the tty or modem before sending anything else.  This may be used to initialize  a  modem.   Non-
              printable characters may be sent by writing their octal code preceded by a backslash (\).  For example, to send a linefeed character
              (ASCII 10, octal 012), write \012.

       -J, --noclear
              Do not clear the screen before prompting for the login name.  By default the screen is cleared.

       -l, --login-program login_program
              Invoke the specified login_program instead of /bin/login.  This allows the use of a non-standard  login  program.   Such  a  program
              could, for example, ask for a dial-up password or use a different password file. See --login-options.

       -L, --local-line[=mode]
              Control the CLOCAL line flag.  The optional mode argument is 'auto', 'always' or 'never'.  If the mode argument is omitted, then the
              default is 'always'.  If the --local-line option is not given at all, then the default is 'auto'.

              always Forces the line to be a local line with no need for carrier detect.  This can be useful when you have a locally attached ter‐
                     minal where the serial line does not set the carrier-detect signal.

              never  Explicitly clears the CLOCAL flag from the line setting and the carrier-detect signal is expected on the line.

              auto   The agetty default.  Does not modify the CLOCAL setting and follows the setting enabled by the kernel.

       -m, --extract-baud
              Try  to extract the baud rate from the CONNECT status message produced by Hayes(tm)-compatible modems.  These status messages are of
              the form: "<junk><speed><junk>".  agetty assumes that the modem emits its status message at the same speed as  specified  with  (the
              first) baud_rate value on the command line.

              Since  the  --extract-baud  feature  may fail on heavily-loaded systems, you still should enable BREAK processing by enumerating all
              expected baud rates on the command line.

       -n, --skip-login
              Do not prompt the user for a login name.  This can be used in connection with the --login-program option to  invoke  a  non-standard
              login  process  such  as  a  BBS system.  Note that with the --skip-login option, agetty gets no input from the user who logs in and
              therefore will not be able to figure out parity, character size, and newline processing of the connection.   It  defaults  to  space
              parity,  7 bit characters, and ASCII CR (13) end-of-line character.  Beware that the program that agetty starts (usually /bin/login)
              is run as root.

       -N, --nonewline
              Do not print a newline before writing out /etc/issue.

       -o, --login-options "login_options"
              Options  and arguments that  are passed to login(1). Where \u is replaced by the login name. For example:

                  --login-options '-h darkstar -- \u'

              See --autologin, --login-program and --remote.

              Please read the SECURITY NOTICE below before using this option.

       -p, --login-pause
              Wait for any key before dropping to the login prompt.  Can be combined with --autologin to save memory by lazily spawning shells.

       -r, --chroot directory
              Change root to the specified directory.

       -R, --hangup
              Call vhangup() to do a virtual hangup of the specified terminal.

       -s, --keep-baud
              Try to keep the existing baud rate.  The baud rates from the command line are used when agetty receives a BREAK character.

       -t, --timeout timeout
              Terminate if no user name could be read within timeout seconds.  Use of this option with hardwired  terminal  lines  is  not  recom‐
              mended.

       -U, --detect-case
              Turn  on  support for detecting an uppercase-only terminal.  This setting will detect a login name containing only capitals as indi‐
              cating an uppercase-only terminal and turn on some upper-to-lower case conversions.  Note that this has no support for  any  Unicode
              characters.

       -w, --wait-cr
              Wait  for the user or the modem to send a carriage-return or a linefeed character before sending the /etc/issue file (or others) and
              the login prompt.  This is useful with the --init-string option.

       --nohints
              Do not print hints about Num, Caps and Scroll Locks.

       --nohostname
              By default the hostname will be printed.  With this option enabled, no hostname at all will be shown.

       --long-hostname
              By default the hostname is only printed until the first dot.  With this option enabled, the fully  qualified  hostname  by  gethost‐
              name(3P) or (if not found) by getaddrinfo(3) is shown.

       --erase-chars string
              This  option  specifies  additional  characters that should be interpreted as a backspace ("ignore the previous character") when the
              user types the login name.  The default additional ´erase´ has been ´#´, but since util-linux 2.23 no  additional  erase  characters
              are enabled by default.

       --kill-chars string
              This  option  specifies  additional characters that should be interpreted as a kill ("ignore all previous characters") when the user
              types the login name.  The default additional ´kill´ has been ´@´, but since util-linux  2.23  no  additional  kill  characters  are
              enabled by default.

       --chdir directory
              Change directory before the login.

       --delay number
              Sleep seconds before open tty.

       --nice number
              Run login with this priority.

       --reload
              Ask  all running agetty instances to reload and update their displayed prompts, if the user has not yet commenced logging in.  After
              doing so the command will exit.  This feature might be unsupported on systems without Linux inotify(7).

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --help Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLES
       This section shows examples for the process field of an entry in the /etc/inittab file.  You'll have to prepend appropriate values for  the
       other fields.  See inittab(5) for more details.

       For a hardwired line or a console tty:

              /sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS1

       For a directly connected terminal without proper carrier-detect wiring (try this if your terminal just sleeps instead of giving you a pass‐
       word: prompt):

              /sbin/agetty --local-line 9600 ttyS1 vt100

       For an old-style dial-in line with a 9600/2400/1200 baud modem:

              /sbin/agetty --extract-baud --timeout 60 ttyS1 9600,2400,1200

       For a Hayes modem with a fixed 115200 bps interface to the machine (the example init string turns off modem echo and  result  codes,  makes
       modem/computer DCD track modem/modem DCD, makes a DTR drop cause a disconnection, and turns on auto-answer after 1 ring):

              /sbin/agetty --wait-cr --init-string 'ATE0Q1&D2&C1S0=1 15' 115200 ttyS1

SECURITY NOTICE
       If you use the --login-program and --login-options options, be aware that a malicious user may try to enter lognames with embedded options,
       which then get passed to the used login program.  Agetty does check for a leading "-" and makes sure the logname gets passed as one parame‐
       ter  (so  embedded  spaces will not create yet another parameter), but depending on how the login binary parses the command line that might
       not be sufficient.  Check that the used login program cannot be abused this way.

       Some  programs use "--" to indicate that the rest of the commandline should not be interpreted as options.  Use this feature  if  available
       by passing "--" before the username gets passed by \u.

ISSUE ESCAPES
       The  issue-file  (/etc/issue,  or  the  file set with the --issue-file option) may contain certain escape codes to display the system name,
       date, time etcetera.  All escape codes consist of a backslash (\) immediately followed by one of the characters listed below.

       4 or 4{interface}
              Insert the IPv4 address of the specified network interface (for example: \4{eth0}).  If the interface  argument  is  not  specified,
              then  select the first fully configured (UP, non-LOCALBACK, RUNNING) interface.  If not any configured interface is found, fall back
              to the IP address of the machine's hostname.

       6 or 6{interface}
              The same as \4 but for IPv6.

       b      Insert the baudrate of the current line.

       d      Insert the current date.

       e or e{name}
              Translate the human-readable name to an escape sequence and insert it (for example: \e{red}Alert text.\e{reset}).  If the name argu‐
              ment  is not specified, then insert \033.  The currently supported names are: black, blink, blue, bold, brown, cyan, darkgray, gray,
              green, halfbright, lightblue, lightcyan, lightgray, lightgreen, lightmagenta, lightred, magenta, red, reset,  reverse,  and  yellow.
              All unknown names are silently ignored.

       s      Insert the system name (the name of the operating system).  Same as 'uname -s'.  See also the \S escape code.

       S or S{VARIABLE}
              Insert  the VARIABLE data from /etc/os-release.  If this file does not exist then fall back to /usr/lib/os-release.  If the VARIABLE
              argument is not specified, then use PRETTY_NAME from the file or the system  name  (see  \s).   This  escape  code  allows  to  keep
              /etc/issue distribution and release independent.  Note that \S{ANSI_COLOR} is converted to the real terminal escape sequence.

       l      Insert the name of the current tty line.

       m      Insert the architecture identifier of the machine.  Same as 'uname -m'.

       n      Insert the nodename of the machine, also known as the hostname.  Same as 'uname -n'.

       o      Insert the NIS domainname of the machine.  Same as 'hostname -d'.

       O      Insert the DNS domainname of the machine.

       r      Insert the release number of the OS.  Same as 'uname -r'.

       t      Insert the current time.

       u      Insert the number of current users logged in.

       U      Insert the string "1 user" or "<n> users" where <n> is the number of current users logged in.

       v      Insert the version of the OS, that is, the build-date and such.

       An example.  On my system, the following /etc/issue file:

              This is \n.\o (\s \m \r) \t

       displays as:

              This is thingol.orcan.dk (Linux i386 1.1.9) 18:29:30

FILES
       /var/run/utmp
              the system status file.

       /etc/issue
              printed before the login prompt.

       /etc/os-release /usr/lib/os-release
              operating system identification data.

       /dev/console
              problem reports (if syslog(3) is not used).

       /etc/inittab
              init(8) configuration file for SysV-style init daemon.

BUGS
       The  baud-rate  detection  feature  (the --extract-baud option) requires that agetty be scheduled soon enough after completion of a dial-in
       call (within 30 ms with modems that talk at 2400 baud).  For robustness, always use the --extract-baud option in combination with a  multi‐
       ple baud rate command-line argument, so that BREAK processing is enabled.

       The text in the /etc/issue file (or other) and the login prompt are always output with 7-bit characters and space parity.

       The baud-rate detection feature (the --extract-baud option) requires that the modem emits its status message after raising the DCD line.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Depending  on  how  the  program  was configured, all diagnostics are written to the console device or reported via the syslog(3) facility.
       Error messages are produced if the port argument does not specify a terminal device; if there is no utmp  entry  for  the  current  process
       (System V only); and so on.
