BLKDISCARD(8)               System Administration               BLKDISCARD(8)

NAME
       blkdiscard - discard sectors on a device

SYNOPSIS
       blkdiscard [options] [-o offset] [-l length] device

DESCRIPTION
       blkdiscard  is  used  to  discard  device sectors.  This is useful for
       solid-state drivers (SSDs)  and  thinly-provisioned  storage.   Unlike
       fstrim(8), this command is used directly on the block device.

       By default, blkdiscard will discard all blocks on the device.  Options
       may be used to modify  this  behavior  based  on  range  or  size,  as
       explained below.

       The device argument is the pathname of the block device.

       WARNING: All data in the discarded region on the device will be lost!

OPTIONS
       The  offset and length arguments may be followed by the multiplicative
       suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB,  TiB,  PiB,
       EiB, ZiB and YiB (the "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning
       as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so  on  for
       GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       -o, --offset offset
              Byte  offset  into  the  device from which to start discarding.
              The provided value will be aligned to the device  sector  size.
              The default value is zero.

       -l, --length length
              The  number  of  bytes  to  discard (counting from the starting
              point).  The provided value will be aligned to the device  sec‐
              tor  size.   If the specified value extends past the end of the
              device, blkdiscard will stop at the device size boundary.   The
              default value extends to the end of the device.

       -p, --step length
              The  number  of  bytes  to  discard  within  one iteration. The
              default is to discard all by one ioctl call.

       -s, --secure
              Perform a secure discard.  A secure discard is the  same  as  a
              regular  discard except that all copies of the discarded blocks
              that were possibly created by garbage collection must  also  be
              erased.  This requires support from the device.

       -z, --zeroout
              Zero-fill rather than discard.

       -v, --verbose
              Display the aligned values of offset and length.  If the --step
              option is specified, it prints the discard progress every  sec‐
              ond.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.
