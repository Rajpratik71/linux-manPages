SYNOPSIS
       regexxer

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the regexxer command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original
       program does not have a manual page.

       regexxer is a program that allows you to select a group of files, and perform perl-style regular expression search and  replace  operations
       to the files, in an interactive graphical interface.

SEE ALSO
       perlre(1).
