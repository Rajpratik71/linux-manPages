NAME
       ureadahead - Read files in advance during boot

SYNOPSIS
       ureadahead [OPTIONS]...  [PACK]

DESCRIPTION
       ureadahead (über-readahead) is used during boot to read files in advance of when they are needed such that they are already in the page cache, improving boot performance.

       When  started  without any arguments, it checks for the existance and age of the default pack file /var/lib/ureadahead/pack, and if not present or older than a month, will discard it and retrace
       the boot sequence.  The pack will then contain information about the files opened during boot, and the blocks that were in memory at the completion of the boot.

       If the file exists and is newer than a month old, or an alternate PACK path is given on the command-line, the files listed in the pack are opened and the blocks read into the  page  cache  using
       the readahead(2) system call.

       Pack files are automatically optimised for Solid-State Disks or rotational Hard Drives, depending on which you have.

OPTIONS
       --verbose
              May  be  used to report on ureadahead's operation.  In particular, this causes information about the size of the pack file to be output when reading and a complete dump of the contents of
              the pack file after tracing.

       --daemon
              Places ureadahead into the background once the pack file has been read, or once tracing has been enabled.

              This is ignored when reading on rotational hard drives, since it's important for performance reasons not to contend with other processes for I/O.

       --force-trace
              Discards all pack files and forces re-tracing.

       --timeout=SECONDS
              Normally when tracing, ureadahead will wait for a TERM or INT signal before concluding and generating the pack file.  This option instead sets a timeout after which tracing is terminated.

       --dump Dump the contents of the pack file to standard output in a pretty format, does not trace or read the contents into memory.

       --sort=SORT
              Used with --dump to sort the output.

              The default is open, which is the order that the files will be opened.  path sorts by path name, disk sorts by on-disk location, and size sorts by the amount of data that will be read for
              that file.

OTHER MOUNT POINTS
       PACK need not be the filename of a pack, instead it may be the name of a mount point (or indeed any non-file within the filesystem), in which case the pack for that device is read instead.  This
       allows ureadahead to be called in the style ureadahead /usr for filesystems split across multiple devices.

       Pack files for these other devices are also stored under /var/lib/ureadahead and are named mountpoint.pack

       When tracing, these will be automatically generated.

FILES
       /var/lib/ureadahead/pack
