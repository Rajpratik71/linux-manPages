IWPRIV(8)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                 IWPRIV(8)

NAME
       iwpriv  -  configure optionals (private) parameters of a wireless net‐
       work interface

SYNOPSIS
       iwpriv [interface]
       iwpriv interface private-command [private-parameters]
       iwpriv interface private-command [I] [private-parameters]
       iwpriv interface --all

DESCRIPTION
       Iwpriv is the companion tool to iwconfig(8).  Iwpriv deals with param‐
       eters  and  setting  specific  to  each driver (as opposed to iwconfig
       which deals with generic ones).

       Without any argument,  iwpriv  list  the  available  private  commands
       available  on  each  interface,  and the parameters that they require.
       Using this information, the user may apply  those  interface  specific
       commands on the specified interface.

       In theory, the documentation of each device driver should indicate how
       to use those interface specific commands and their effect.

PARAMETERS
       private-command [private-parameters]
              Execute the specified private-command on the interface.
              The command may optionally take or require arguments,  and  may
              display information. Therefore, the command line parameters may
              or may not be needed and should match the command expectations.
              The  list of commands that iwpriv displays (when called without
              argument) should give you some hints about those parameters.
              However you should refer to the device driver documentation for
              information on how to properly use the command and the effect.

       private-command [I] [private-parameters]
              Idem,  except that I (an integer) is passed to the command as a
              Token Index.  Only some command will use the Token Index  (most
              will  ignore  it), and the driver documentation should tell you
              when it's needed.

       -a/--all
              Execute and display all the private commands  that  don't  take
              any arguments (i.e.  read only).

DISPLAY
       For  each  device  which support private commands, iwpriv will display
       the list of private commands available.

       This include the name of the private command, the number or  arguments
       that  may  be set and their type, and the number or arguments that may
       be display and their type.

       For example, you may have the following display :
       eth0      Available private ioctl :
                 setqualthr (89F0) : set   1 byte & get   0
                 gethisto (89F7) : set   0      & get  16 int

       This indicate that you may set the quality threshold  and  display  an
       histogram of up to 16 values with the following commands :
         iwpriv eth0 setqualthr 20
         iwpriv eth0 gethisto
