DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the graphmonkey command.

       graphmonkey is a Mono based graph drawing application.

       The following symbols are available:
            + , -, *, /
            square roots : sqrt()
            powers square : ^
            brackets
            sine : sin()
            cosine : cos()
            tangent : tan()
            arcsine : asin()
            arccosine : acos()
            arctangent : atan()
            hyperbolic sine : sinh()
            hyperbolic cosine : cosh()
            hyperbolic tangent : tan()
            natural logarithm : ln()
            base 10 logarithm : log()
            exponential : exp()
            absolute value : abs()
            greatest integer : int()

       It is also possible to modify the range.

       For example, you can try:
       sin(x)*x
       (sqrt(x)+5)*3
       2.3233^5*(x/cos(x))
       NOTE: replace "."  by "," if you use "," for decimal values in your country
