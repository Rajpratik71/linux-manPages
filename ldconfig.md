LDCONFIG(8)               Linux Programmer's Manual               LDCONFIG(8)

NAME
       ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run-time bindings

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/ldconfig [-nNvXV] [-f conf] [-C cache] [-r root] directory...
       /sbin/ldconfig -l [-v] library...
       /sbin/ldconfig -p

DESCRIPTION
       ldconfig  creates  the  necessary  links  and cache to the most recent
       shared libraries found in the directories  specified  on  the  command
       line,  in  the  file  /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories,
       /lib and /usr/lib (on some 64-bit architectures such  as  x86-64,  lib
       and  /usr/lib  are the trusted directories for 32-bit libraries, while
       /lib64 and /usr/lib64 are used for 64-bit libraries).

       The cache is used  by  the  run-time  linker,  ld.so  or  ld-linux.so.
       ldconfig  checks  the header and filenames of the libraries it encoun‐
       ters when determining which versions should have their links updated.

       ldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libraries (i.e., libc5
       or  libc6/glibc)  based  on  what C libraries, if any, the library was
       linked against.

       Some existing libraries do not contain enough information to allow the
       deduction  of  their type.  Therefore, the /etc/ld.so.conf file format
       allows the specification of an expected type.  This is used  only  for
       those  ELF  libraries  which  we  can  not  work  out.   The format is
       "dirname=TYPE", where TYPE can be libc4, libc5, or libc6.  (This  syn‐
       tax  also  works  on the command line.)  Spaces are not allowed.  Also
       see the -p option.  ldconfig should normally be run by  the  superuser
       as  it may require write permission on some root owned directories and
       files.

OPTIONS
       -c fmt, --format=fmt
              (Since glibc 2.2) Cache format to  use:  old,  new,  or  compat
              (default).

       -C cache
              Use cache instead of /etc/ld.so.cache.

       -f conf
              Use conf instead of /etc/ld.so.conf.

       -i, --ignore-aux-cache
              (Since glibc 2.7) Ignore auxiliary cache file.

       -l     (Since  glibc  2.2)  Library  mode.   Manually  link individual
              libraries.  Intended for use by experts only.

       -n     Process only the directories specified  on  the  command  line.
              Don't  process  the trusted directories, nor those specified in
              /etc/ld.so.conf.  Implies -N.

       -N     Don't rebuild the cache.  Unless -X is  also  specified,  links
              are still updated.

       -p, --print-cache
              Print  the  lists of directories and candidate libraries stored
              in the current cache.

       -r root
              Change to and use root as the root directory.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.  Print current version number, the name  of  each
              directory  as  it  is  scanned, and any links that are created.
              Overrides quiet mode.

       -V, --version
              Print program version.

       -X     Don't update links.  Unless -N is also specified, the cache  is
              still rebuilt.

FILES
       /lib/ld.so
              Run-time linker/loader.
       /etc/ld.so.conf
              File  containing  a list of directories, one per line, in which
              to search for libraries.
       /etc/ld.so.cache
              File containing an ordered  list  of  libraries  found  in  the
              directories  specified  in  /etc/ld.so.conf,  as  well as those
              found in the trusted directories.
