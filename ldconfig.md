NAME
       ldconfig - configure dynamic linker run-time bindings

SYNOPSIS
       /sbin/ldconfig [ -nNvXV ] [ -f conf ] [ -C cache ] [ -r root ] directory ...
       /sbin/ldconfig -l [ -v ] library ...
       /sbin/ldconfig -p

DESCRIPTION
       ldconfig  creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted direc‚Äê
       tories, /lib and /usr/lib (on some 64-bit architectures such as x86-64, lib and /usr/lib are the trusted directories for 32-bit libraries,  while  /lib64  and  /usr/lib64  are  used  for  64-bit
       libraries).

       The  cache  is used by the run-time linker, ld.so or ld-linux.so.  ldconfig checks the header and filenames of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should have their links
       updated.

       ldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libs (i.e., libc5 or libc6/glibc) based on what C libs, if any, the library was linked against.

       Some existing libs do not contain enough information to allow the deduction of their type.  Therefore, the /etc/ld.so.conf file format allows the specification of an expected type.  This is used
       only  for  those  ELF  libs  which  we  can  not work out.  The format is "dirname=TYPE", where TYPE can be libc4, libc5, or libc6.  (This syntax also works on the command line.)  Spaces are not
       allowed.  Also see the -p option.  ldconfig should normally be run by the superuser as it may require write permission on some root owned directories and files.

OPTIONS
       -c fmt, --format=fmt
              (Since glibc 2.2) Cache format to use: old, new, or compat (default).

       -C cache
              Use cache instead of /etc/ld.so.cache.

       -f conf
              Use conf instead of /etc/ld.so.conf.

       -i, --ignore-aux-cache
              (Since glibc 2.7) Ignore auxiliary cache file.

       -l     (Since glibc 2.2) Library mode.  Manually link individual libraries.  Intended for use by experts only.

       -n     Only process directories specified on the command line.  Don't process the trusted directories, nor those specified in /etc/ld.so.conf.  Implies -N.

       -N     Don't rebuild the cache.  Unless -X is also specified, links are still updated.

       -p, --print-cache
              Print the lists of directories and candidate libraries stored in the current cache.

       -r  root
              Change to and use root as the root directory.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.  Print current version number, the name of each directory as it is scanned, and any links that are created.  Overrides quiet mode.

       -V, --version
              Print program version.

       -X     Don't update links.  Unless -N is also specified, the cache is still rebuilt.

FILES
       /lib/ld.so          Run-time linker/loader.
       /etc/ld.so.conf     File containing a list of directories, one per line, in which to search for libraries.
       /etc/ld.so.cache    File containing an ordered list of libraries found in the directories specified in /etc/ld.so.conf, as well as those found in the trusted directories.
