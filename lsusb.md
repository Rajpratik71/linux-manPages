lsusb(8)                     Linux USB Utilities                     lsusb(8)

NAME
       lsusb - list USB devices

SYNOPSIS
       lsusb [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       lsusb  is  a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the
       system and the devices connected to them.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Tells lsusb to be  verbose  and  display  detailed  information
              about  the devices shown.  This includes configuration descrip‐
              tors for the device's current speed.  Class descriptors will be
              shown,  when  available,  for USB device classes including hub,
              audio, HID, communications, and chipcard.

       -s [[bus]:][devnum]
              Show only devices in specified bus and/or  devnum.   Both  ID's
              are given in decimal and may be omitted.

       -d [vendor]:[product]
              Show  only  devices  with  the specified vendor and product ID.
              Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.

       -D device
              Do not scan the /dev/bus/usb directory,  instead  display  only
              information  about  the device whose device file is given.  The
              device file  should  be  something  like  /dev/bus/usb/001/001.
              This  option  displays  detailed information like the v option;
              you must be root to do this.

       -t     Tells lsusb to dump the physical  USB  device  hierarchy  as  a
              tree. This overrides the v option.

       -V, --version
              Print   version  information on standard output, then exit suc‐
              cessfully.

RETURN VALUE
       If the specified  device  is  not  found,  a  non-zero  exit  code  is
       returned.

FILES
       /var/lib/usbutils/usb.ids
              A  list of all known USB ID's (vendors, products, classes, sub‐
              classes and protocols).
