NAME
       pacmd - Reconfigure a PulseAudio sound server during runtime

SYNOPSIS
       pacmd

       pacmd --help

       pacmd --version

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool can be used to introspect or reconfigure a running PulseAu‐
       dio sound server during runtime. It connects to the sound  server  and
       offers a simple live shell that can be used to enter the commands also
       understood in the default.pa configuration scripts.

       To exit the live shell, use  ctrl+d.  Note  that  the  'exit'  command
       inside the shell will tell the PulseAudio daemon itself to shutdown!

       If  any  arguments are passed on the command line, they will be passed
       into the live shell which will process the command and exit.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
