NAME
       mesg - display (or do not display) messages from other users

SYNOPSIS
       mesg [option] [n|y]

DESCRIPTION
       The mesg utility is invoked by a user to control write access others have to the terminal device associated with standard error output.  If write access is allowed, then programs such as talk(1)
       and write(1) may display messages on the terminal.

       Traditionally, write access is allowed by default.  However, as users become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to remove write access by default, at least for  the  pri‐
       mary login shell.  To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them to be set, mesg should be executed in your login scripts.

ARGUMENTS
       n      Disallow messages.

       y      Allow messages to be displayed.

       If no arguments are given, mesg shows the current message status on standard error output.
