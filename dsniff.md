NAME
       dsniff - password sniffer

SYNOPSIS
       dsniff [-c] [-d] [-m] [-n] [-i interface | -p pcapfile] [-s snaplen] [-f services] [-t trigger[,...]]]  [-r|-w savefile] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       dsniff  is a password sniffer which handles FTP, Telnet, SMTP, HTTP, POP, poppass, NNTP, IMAP, SNMP, LDAP, Rlogin, RIP, OSPF, PPTP MS-CHAP,
       NFS, VRRP, YP/NIS, SOCKS, X11, CVS, IRC, AIM, ICQ, Napster, PostgreSQL, Meeting Maker, Citrix ICA, Symantec pcAnywhere, NAI Sniffer, Micro‚Äê
       soft SMB, Oracle SQL*Net, Sybase and Microsoft SQL protocols.

       dsniff  automatically detects and minimally parses each application protocol, only saving the interesting bits, and uses Berkeley DB as its
       output file format, only logging unique authentication attempts. Full TCP/IP reassembly is provided by libnids(3).

       I wrote dsniff with honest intentions - to audit my own network, and to demonstrate the insecurity of cleartext network protocols.   Please
       do not abuse this software.

OPTIONS
       -c     Perform  half-duplex  TCP  stream  reassembly,  to handle asymmetrically routed traffic (such as when using arpspoof(8) to intercept
              client traffic bound for the local gateway).

       -d     Enable debugging mode.

       -m     Enable automatic protocol detection.

       -n     Do not resolve IP addresses to hostnames.

       -i interface
              Specify the interface to listen on.

       -p pcapfile
              Rather than processing the contents of packets observed upon the network process the given PCAP capture file.

       -s snaplen
              Analyze at most the first snaplen bytes of each TCP connection, rather than the default of 1024.

       -f services
              Load triggers from a services file.

        -t trigger[,...]
              Load triggers from a comma-separated list, specified as port/proto=service (e.g. 80/tcp=http).

       -r savefile
              Read sniffed sessions from a savefile created with the -w option.

       -w file
              Write sniffed sessions to savefile rather than parsing and printing them out.

       expression
              Specify a tcpdump(8) filter expression to select traffic to sniff.

       On a hangup signal dsniff will dump its current trigger table to dsniff.services.

FILES

BUGS
       dsniff's automatic protocol detection feature is based on the classic file(1) command by Ian Darwin, and shares its historical limitations
       and bugs.
