NAME
       ntfswipe - overwrite unused space on an NTFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       ntfswipe [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfswipe clears all or part of unused space on an NTFS volume by over‐
       writing with zeroes or random bytes.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfswipe  accepts.   Nearly
       all  options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
       - and the long name is preceded by --.   Any  single  letter  options,
       that  don't  take  an argument, can be combined into a single command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be  abbrevi‐
       ated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -a, --all
              Wipe  all  unused space. This may take significant time. If the
              option --unused-fast (or -U) is also present, the faster wiping
              method is used.

       -b, --bytes BYTE-LIST
              Define  the  allowed replacement bytes which are drawn randomly
              to overwrite the unused space. BYTE-LIST is  a  comma-separated
              list  of  values  in range 0-255 expressed in octal, decimal or
              hexadecimal base.

       -c, --count NUM
              Define the number of times the unused space is to be  overwrit‐
              ten.  If both options --bytes and --count are set, the space is
              repeatedly overwritten this number of times by each of the val‐
              ues in the list.

       -d, --directory
              Wipe  all  the  directory  indexes,  which may contain names of
              deleted files.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using  a
              mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -i, --info
              Display details about unused space, without wiping anything.

       -l, --logfile
              Overwrite the logfile (update journal).

       -m, --mft
              Overwrite  the  unused space in the MFT (main file table, which
              contains the file names, and the contents of short files).

       -n, --no-action
              Executes the wiping process without writing to device.

       -p, --pagefile
              Overwrite the Windows swap space.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -s, --undel
              Overwrite the space which had been allocated to  a  file  which
              has been deleted recently and is still undeletable. This option
              is not compatible with --bytes and the  replacement  bytes  are
              random ones or taken from a standard list.

       -t, --tails
              Overwrite  the  space  at the end of files which is unused, but
              allocated because the allocations are always done by full clus‐
              ters.

       -u, --unused
              Overwrite  the  space  which  is currently not allocated to any
              file (but may have been used in the past).

       -U, --unused-fast
              Overwrite the space which is currently  not  allocated  to  any
              file,  trying  not  to overwrite the space not written to since
              the previous wiping.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages. This option  may  be
              used twice to display even more messages.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license of ntfswipe.
