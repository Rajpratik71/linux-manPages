DNSSEC-IMPORTKEY(8)                                                                                 BIND9                                                                                 DNSSEC-IMPORTKEY(8)



NAME
       dnssec-importkey - import DNSKEY records from external systems so they can be managed

SYNOPSIS
       dnssec-importkey [-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset] [-P sync date/offset] [-D date/offset] [-D sync date/offset] [-h] [-v level] [-V] {keyfile}

       dnssec-importkey {-f filename} [-K directory] [-L ttl] [-P date/offset] [-P sync date/offset] [-D date/offset] [-D sync date/offset] [-h] [-v level] [-V] [dnsname]

DESCRIPTION
       dnssec-importkey reads a public DNSKEY record and generates a pair of .key/.private files. The DNSKEY record may be read from an existing .key file, in which case a corresponding .private file will
       be generated, or it may be read from any other file or from the standard input, in which case both .key and .private files will be generated.

       The newly-created .private file does not contain private key data, and cannot be used for signing. However, having a .private file makes it possible to set publication (-P) and deletion (-D) times
       for the key, which means the public key can be added to and removed from the DNSKEY RRset on schedule even if the true private key is stored offline.

OPTIONS
       -f filename
           Zone file mode: instead of a public keyfile name, the argument is the DNS domain name of a zone master file, which can be read from file. If the domain name is the same as file, then it may be
           omitted.

           If file is set to "-", then the zone data is read from the standard input.

       -K directory
           Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.

       -L ttl
           Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY
           RRset in place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting the default TTL to 0 or none removes it.

       -h
           Emit usage message and exit.

       -v level
           Sets the debugging level.

       -V
           Prints version information.

TIMING OPTIONS
       Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the argument begins with a '+' or '-', it is interpreted as an offset from the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is
       followed by one of the suffixes 'y', 'mo', 'w', 'd', 'h', or 'mi', then the offset is computed in years (defined as 365 24-hour days, ignoring leap years), months (defined as 30 24-hour days),
       weeks, days, hours, or minutes, respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To explicitly prevent a date from being set, use 'none' or 'never'.

       -P date/offset
           Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used to sign it.

       -P sync date/offset
           Sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be published to the zone.

       -D date/offset
           Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key repository, however.)

       -D sync date/offset
           Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key are to be deleted.

FILES
       A keyfile can be designed by the key identification Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii or the full file name Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key as generated by dnssec-keygen(8).
