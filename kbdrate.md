KBDRATE(8)                                                   Linux Programmer's Manual                                                  KBDRATE(8)

NAME
       kbdrate - reset the keyboard repeat rate and delay time

SYNOPSIS
       kbdrate [ -s ] [ -r rate ] [ -d delay ]

DESCRIPTION
       kbdrate  is used to change the keyboard repeat rate and delay time.  The delay is the amount of time that a key must be depressed before it
       will start to repeat.

       Using kbdrate without any options will reset the repeat rate to 10.9 characters per second (cps) and the delay to 250 milliseconds (ms) for
       Intel-  and M68K-based systems.  These are the IBM defaults. On SPARC-based systems it will reset the repeat rate to 5 cps and the delay to
       200 ms.

OPTIONS
       -s     Silent.  No messages are printed.

       -r rate
              Change the keyboard repeat rate to rate cps.   For Intel-based systems, the allowable range is from 2.0 to 30.0 cps.  Only  certain,
              specific  values are possible, and the program will select the nearest possible value to the one specified.  The possible values are
              given, in characters per second, as follows: 2.0, 2.1, 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, 3.0, 3.3, 3.7, 4.0, 4.3, 4.6, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0,  6.7,  7.5,  8.0,
              8.6,  9.2,  10.0,  10.9,  12.0,  13.3, 15.0, 16.0, 17.1, 18.5, 20.0, 21.8, 24.0, 26.7, 30.0.  For SPARC-based systems, the allowable
              range is from 0 (no repeat) to 50 cps.

       -d delay
              Change the delay to delay milliseconds.  For Intel-based systems, the allowable range is from 250 to 1000 ms, in 250 ms  steps.  For
              SPARC systems, possible values are between 10 ms and 1440 ms, in 10 ms steps.

       -V     Display a version number and exit.

BUGS
       Not all keyboards support all rates.

       Not all keyboards have the rates mapped in the same way.

       Setting  the  repeat rate on the Gateway AnyKey keyboard does not work.  If someone with a Gateway figures out how to program the keyboard,
       please send mail to util-linux@math.uio.no.

       All this is very architecture dependent.  Nowadays kbdrate first tries the KDKBDREP and KIOCSRATE ioctls.  (The former usually works on  an
       m68k machine, the latter for SPARC.)  When these ioctls fail an ioport interface as on i386 is assumed.
