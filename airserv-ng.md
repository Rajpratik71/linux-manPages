NAME
       airserv-ng - a wireless card server

SYNOPSIS
       airserv-ng <options>

DESCRIPTION
       airserv-ng is a wireless card server which allows multiple wireless application programs to independently use a wireless card via a client-
       server TCP network connection. All operating system and wireless card driver specific code is incorporated into the server. This eliminates
       the  need  for each wireless application to contain the complex wireless card and driver logic. It is also supports multiple operating sys‚Äê
       tems.

              channel  change requests and invalid client command requests in addition to the debug level 1 messages.  Debug level of 3 displays a
              message each time a packet (and its length) is sent to the client. It also include messages from level 2 (and 1).
