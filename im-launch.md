       SION-PROGRAM such as x-session-manager.

       If you have any problem, see the first part of ~/.xsession-errors and look for the cause.  If you are running im-config while Debian (sid) system is undergoing a major library transition, you
       may need to manually set up ~/.xinputrc with adjusted library version number etc.  Please file a bug report to the im-config package using reportbug(1) describing your resolution experience.
