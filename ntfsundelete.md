NAME
       ntfsundelete - recover a deleted file from an NTFS volume.

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsundelete [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsundelete has three modes of operation: scan, undelete and copy.

   Scan
       The  default mode, scan simply reads an NTFS Volume and looks for files that have been deleted.  Then it will print a list giving the inode
       number, name and size.

   Undelete
       The undelete mode takes the files either matching the regular expression (option -m) or  specified by the inode-expressions and recovers as
       much  of  the  data as possible.   It saves the result to another location.  Partly for safety, but mostly because NTFS write support isn't
       finished.

   Copy
       This is a wizard's option.  It will save a portion of the MFT to a file.  This probably only be useful when debugging ntfsundelete

   Notes
       ntfsundelete only ever reads from the NTFS Volume.  ntfsundelete will never change the volume.

CAVEATS
   Miracles
       ntfsundelete cannot perform the impossible.

       When a file is deleted the MFT Record is marked as not in use and the bitmap representing the disk usage is updated.  If  the  power  isn't
       turned  off  immediately,  the  free  space,  where the file used to live, may become overwritten.  Worse, the MFT Record may be reused for
       another file.  If this happens it is impossible to tell where the file was on disk.

       Even if all the clusters of a file are not in use, there is no guarantee that they haven't been overwritten by some short-lived file.

   Locale
       In NTFS all the filenames are stored as Unicode.  They will be converted into the current locale for display by ntfsundelete.  The  utility
       has successfully displayed some Chinese pictogram filenames and then correctly recovered them.

   Extended MFT Records
       In rare circumstances, a single MFT Record will not be large enough to hold the metadata describing a file (a file would have to be in hun‐
       dreds of fragments for this to happen).  In these cases one MFT record may hold the filename, but another will hold the  information  about
       the data.  ntfsundelete will not try and piece together such records.  It will simply show unnamed files with data.

   Compressed and Encrypted Files
       ntfsundelete cannot recover compressed or encrypted files.  When scanning for them, it will display as being 0% recoverable.

   The Recovered File's Size and Date
       To  recover  a  file  ntfsundelete  has to read the file's metadata.  Unfortunately, this isn't always intact.  When a file is deleted, the
       metadata can be left in an inconsistent state. e.g.  the file size may be zero; the dates of the file  may  be  set  to  the  time  it  was
       deleted, or random.
       To  be  safe ntfsundelete will pick the largest file size it finds and write that to disk.  It will also try and set the file's date to the
       last modified date.  This date may be the correct last modified date, or something unexpected.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsundelete accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded
       by  -  and the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -b, --byte NUM
              If any clusters of the file cannot be recovered, the missing parts will be filled with this byte.  The default is zeros.

       -C, --case
              When scanning an NTFS volume, any filename matching (using the --match option) is case-insensitive.  This option makes the  matching
              case-sensitive.

       -c, --copy RANGE
              This wizard's option will write a block of MFT FILE records to a file.  The default file is mft which will be created in the current
              directory.  This option can be combined with the --output and --destination options.

       -d, --destination DIR
              This option controls where to put the output file of the --undelete and --copy options.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not overwriting an existing file.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -i, --inodes RANGE
              Recover the files with these inode numbers.  RANGE can be a single inode number, several numbers separated by commas "," or a  range
              separated by a dash "-".

       -m, --match PATTERN
              Filter the output by only looking for matching filenames.  The pattern can include the wildcards '?', match exactly one character or
              '*', match zero or more characters.  By default the matching is case-insensitive.  To make the search case sensitive, use the --case
              option.

       -O, --optimistic
              Recover parts of the file even if they are currently marked as in use.

       -o, --output FILE
              Use this option to set name of output file that --undelete or --copy will create.

       -P, --parent
              Display the parent directory of a deleted file.

       -p, --percentage NUM
              Filter  the  output  of  the  --scan  option,  by only matching files with a certain amount of recoverable content.  Please read the
              caveats section for more details.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount of output to a minimum.  Naturally, it doesn't make sense to combine this option with --scan.

       -s, --scan
              Search through an NTFS volume and print a list of files that could be recovered.  This is the default action of ntfsundelete.   This
              list  can  be filtered by filename, size, percentage recoverable or last modification time, using the --match, --size, --percent and
              --time options, respectively.

              The output of scan will be:

              Inode  Flags  %age     Date    Time    Size  Filename
               6038  FN..    93%  2002-07-17 13:42  26629  thesis.doc

              ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Flag   Description                      │

              │!      Missing attributes               │
              └────────────────────────────────────────┘

              The percentage field shows how much of the file can potentially be recovered.

       -S, --size RANGE
              Filter the output of the --scan option, by looking for a particular range of file sizes.  The range may be specified as two  numbers
              separated  by  a '-'.  The sizes may be abbreviated using the suffixes k, m, g, t, for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes and terabytes
              respectively.

       -t, --time SINCE
              Filter the output of the --scan option.  Only match files that have been altered since this time.  The time must be given as  number
              using a suffix of d, w, m, y for days, weeks, months or years ago.

       -T, --truncate
              If  ntfsundelete is confident about the size of a deleted file, then it will restore the file to exactly that size.  The default be‐
              haviour is to round up the size to the nearest cluster (which will be a multiple of 512 bytes).

       -u, --undelete
              Select undelete mode.  You can specify the files to be recovered using by using --match or --inodes options.   This  option  can  be
              combined with --output, --destination, and --byte.

              When the file is recovered it will be given its original name, unless the --output option is used.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfsundelete prints.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license for ntfsundelete.

EXAMPLES
       Look for deleted files on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1

       Look for deleted documents on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -s -m '*.doc'

       Look for deleted files between 5000 and 6000000 bytes, with at least 90% of the data recoverable, on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -S 5k-6m -p 90

       Look for deleted files altered in the last two days

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -t 2d

       Undelete inodes 2, 5 and 100 to 131 of device /dev/sda1

              ntfsundelete /dev/sda1 -u -i 2,5,100-131

       Undelete inode number 3689, call the file 'work.doc', set it to recovered size and put it in the user's home directory.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -u -T -i 3689 -o work.doc -d ~

       Save MFT Records 3689 to 3690 to a file 'debug'

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -c 3689-3690 -o debug
