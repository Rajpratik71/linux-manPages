NAME
       ntfsundelete - recover a deleted file from an NTFS volume.

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsundelete [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsundelete has three modes of operation: scan, undelete and copy.

   Scan
       The default mode, scan simply reads an NTFS Volume and looks for files
       that have been deleted.  Then it will print a list  giving  the  inode
       number, name and size.

   Undelete
       The  undelete mode takes the files either matching the regular expres‐
       sion (option -m) or  specified by the inode-expressions  and  recovers
       as  much  of  the  data  as possible.   It saves the result to another
       location.  Partly for safety, but mostly because  NTFS  write  support
       isn't finished.

   Copy
       This  is  a  wizard's  option.  It will save a portion of the MFT to a
       file.  This probably only be useful when debugging ntfsundelete

   Notes
       ntfsundelete only ever reads from the NTFS Volume.  ntfsundelete  will
       never change the volume.

CAVEATS
   Miracles
       ntfsundelete cannot perform the impossible.

       When  a file is deleted the MFT Record is marked as not in use and the
       bitmap representing the disk usage is updated.   If  the  power  isn't
       turned  off  immediately, the free space, where the file used to live,
       may become overwritten.  Worse, the  MFT  Record  may  be  reused  for
       another file.  If this happens it is impossible to tell where the file
       was on disk.

       Even if all the clusters of a file are not in use, there is no guaran‐
       tee that they haven't been overwritten by some short-lived file.

   Locale
       In  NTFS  all  the filenames are stored as Unicode.  They will be con‐
       verted into the current locale for display by ntfsundelete.  The util‐
       ity  has  successfully  displayed some Chinese pictogram filenames and
       then correctly recovered them.

   Extended MFT Records
       In rare circumstances, a single MFT Record will not be large enough to
       hold  the  metadata describing a file (a file would have to be in hun‐
       dreds of fragments for this to happen).  In these cases one MFT record
       may hold the filename, but another will hold the information about the
       data.  ntfsundelete will not try and piece together such records.   It
       will simply show unnamed files with data.

   Compressed and Encrypted Files
       ntfsundelete cannot recover compressed or encrypted files.  When scan‐
       ning for them, it will display as being 0% recoverable.

   The Recovered File's Size and Date
       To recover a file  ntfsundelete  has  to  read  the  file's  metadata.
       Unfortunately,  this isn't always intact.  When a file is deleted, the
       metadata can be left in an inconsistent state. e.g.  the file size may
       be  zero; the dates of the file may be set to the time it was deleted,
       or random.
       To be safe ntfsundelete will pick the largest file size it  finds  and
       write  that  to disk.  It will also try and set the file's date to the
       last modified date.  This date may be the correct last modified  date,
       or something unexpected.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary  of  all  the options that ntfsundelete accepts.
       Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  pre‐
       ceded  by  -  and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter
       options, that don't take an argument, can be combined  into  a  single
       command,  e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be
       abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -b, --byte NUM
              If any clusters of the file cannot be  recovered,  the  missing
              parts will be filled with this byte.  The default is zeros.

       -C, --case
              When  scanning an NTFS volume, any filename matching (using the
              --match option) is case-insensitive.   This  option  makes  the
              matching case-sensitive.

       -c, --copy RANGE
              This  wizard's option will write a block of MFT FILE records to
              a file.  The default file is mft which will be created  in  the
              current directory.  This option can be combined with the --out‐
              put and --destination options.

       -d, --destination DIR
              This option controls where  to  put  the  output  file  of  the
              --undelete and --copy options.

       -f, --force
              This  will  override  some sensible defaults, such as not over‐
              writing an existing file.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -i, --inodes RANGE
              Recover the files with these inode numbers.   RANGE  can  be  a
              single inode number, several numbers separated by commas "," or
              a range separated by a dash "-".

       -m, --match PATTERN
              Filter the output by only looking for matching filenames.   The
              pattern  can include the wildcards '?', match exactly one char‐
              acter or '*', match zero or more characters.   By  default  the
              matching  is  case-insensitive.  To make the search case sensi‐
              tive, use the --case option.

       -O, --optimistic
              Recover parts of the file even if they are currently marked  as
              in use.

       -o, --output FILE
              Use  this  option to set name of output file that --undelete or
              --copy will create.

       -P, --parent
              Display the parent directory of a deleted file.

       -p, --percentage NUM
              Filter the output of the --scan option, by only matching  files
              with  a certain amount of recoverable content.  Please read the
              caveats section for more details.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount  of  output  to  a  minimum.   Naturally,  it
              doesn't make sense to combine this option with --scan.

       -s, --scan
              Search  through  an  NTFS volume and print a list of files that
              could be recovered.  This is  the  default  action  of  ntfsun‐
              delete.   This list can be filtered by filename, size, percent‐
              age recoverable or last modification time, using  the  --match,
              --size, --percent and --time options, respectively.

              The output of scan will be:

              Inode  Flags  %age     Date    Time    Size  Filename
               6038  FN..    93%  2002-07-17 13:42  26629  thesis.doc

              ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Flag   Description                      │
              │F/D    File/Directory                   │
              │N/R    (Non-)Resident data stream       │
              │C/E    Compressed/Encrypted data stream │
              │!      Missing attributes               │
              └────────────────────────────────────────┘

              The percentage field shows how much of the file can potentially
              be recovered.

       -S, --size RANGE
              Filter the output of the --scan option, by looking for  a  par‐
              ticular range of file sizes.  The range may be specified as two
              numbers separated by a '-'.  The sizes may be abbreviated using
              the  suffixes  k,  m, g, t, for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes
              and terabytes respectively.

       -t, --time SINCE
              Filter the output of the --scan option.  Only match files  that
              have  been  altered since this time.  The time must be given as
              number using a suffix of d, w, m, y for days, weeks, months  or
              years ago.

       -T, --truncate
              If  ntfsundelete is confident about the size of a deleted file,
              then it will restore  the  file  to  exactly  that  size.   The
              default  behaviour is to round up the size to the nearest clus‐
              ter (which will be a multiple of 512 bytes).

       -u, --undelete
              Select undelete mode.  You can specify the files to  be  recov‐
              ered  using  by using --match or --inodes options.  This option
              can be combined with --output, --destination, and --byte.

              When the file is recovered it will be given its original  name,
              unless the --output option is used.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfsundelete prints.

       -V, --version
              Show  the  version  number,  copyright  and license for ntfsun‐
              delete.

EXAMPLES
       Look for deleted files on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1

       Look for deleted documents on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -s -m '*.doc'

       Look for deleted files between 5000 and 6000000 bytes, with  at  least
       90% of the data recoverable, on /dev/hda1.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -S 5k-6m -p 90

       Look for deleted files altered in the last two days

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -t 2d

       Undelete inodes 2, 5 and 100 to 131 of device /dev/sda1

              ntfsundelete /dev/sda1 -u -i 2,5,100-131

       Undelete inode number 3689, call the file 'work.doc', set it to recov‐
       ered size and put it in the user's home directory.

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -u -T -i 3689 -o work.doc -d ~

       Save MFT Records 3689 to 3690 to a file 'debug'

              ntfsundelete /dev/hda1 -c 3689-3690 -o debug
