NAME
       update-leap - leap-seconds file manager/updater

SYNOPSIS
       update-leap [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       update-leap will validate the file currently on the local system and if necessary, updates leap-second definition file.

       Ordinarily,  the  file is found using the "leapfile" directive in ntp.conf(5).  However, an alternate location can be specified on the com‚Äê
       mand line.

       If the file does not exist, is not valid, has expired, or is expiring soon, a new copy will be downloaded.  If the new copy  validates,  it
       is installed and NTP is (optionally) restarted.

       If the current file is acceptable, no download or restart occurs.

       -c can also be used to invoke another script to perform administrative functions, e.g. to copy the file to other local systems.

       This  can  be  run  as  a  cron  job.  As the file is rarely updated, and leap seconds are announced at least one month in advance (usually
       longer), it need not be run more frequently than about once every three weeks.

       For cron-friendly behavior, define CRONJOB=1 in the crontab.

       This script depends on$REQUIREDCMDS

OPTIONS
       -s string, --source-url=string
              The URL of the master copy of the leapseconds file.

              Specify the URL of the master copy to download $LEAPSRC

       -4, --ipv4

                      to the IPv4 namespace.
                      _EndOfDoc_; };

              flag = {
                  name      = ipv6;
                  flags-cant = ipv4, prefer;
                  value     = 6;

                      to the IPv6 namespace.
                      _EndOfDoc_; };

              flag = {
                  name        = prefer;
                  flags-cant = ipv4, ipv6;
                  value = p;
                  arg-type    = keyword;
                  keyword    = 4, 6;
                  descrip     = 'Prefer IPv4 or IPv6 (as specified) addresses, but use either';
                  doc         = <<-  _EndOfDoc_ Prefer IPv4 or IPv6 (as specified) addresses, but use either.

       -d float, --destination=float

              Specify  how long before expiration the file is to be refreshed Units are required, e.g. "-e 60 days"  Note that larger values imply

              Location of the ntp.conf file.
