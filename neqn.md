NEQN(1)                    General Commands Manual                    NEQN(1)

NAME
       neqn - format equations for ascii output

SYNOPSIS
       neqn [eqn options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  neqn  program  is  actually just a shell script which invokes the
       eqn(1) command with the ascii output device.

       Note that eqn does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices
       (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

SEE ALSO
       eqn(1)
