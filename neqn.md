NAME
       neqn - format equations for ascii output

SYNOPSIS
       neqn [eqn options]

DESCRIPTION
       The neqn program is actually just a shell script which invokes the eqn(1) command with the ascii output device.

       Note that eqn does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

SEE ALSO
