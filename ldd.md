NAME
       ldd - print shared object dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       ldd [option]... file...

DESCRIPTION
       ldd prints the shared objects (shared libraries) required by each program or shared object specified on the command line.

   Security
       In the usual case, ldd invokes the standard dynamic linker (see ld.so(8)) with the LD_TRACE_LOADED_OBJECTS environment variable set to 1, which causes the linker to display the library dependen‚Äê
       cies.  Be aware, however, that in some circumstances, some versions of ldd may attempt to obtain the dependency information by directly executing the program.  Thus, you should never employ  ldd
       on an untrusted executable, since this may result in the execution of arbitrary code.  A safer alternative when dealing with untrusted executables is:

           $ objdump -p /path/to/program | grep NEEDED

OPTIONS
       --version
              Print the version number of ldd.

       -v, --verbose
              Print all information, including, for example, symbol versioning information.

       -u, --unused
              Print unused direct dependencies.  (Since glibc 2.3.4.)

       -d, --data-relocs
              Perform relocations and report any missing objects (ELF only).

       -r, --function-relocs
              Perform relocations for both data objects and functions, and report any missing objects or functions (ELF only).

       --help Usage information.

BUGS
       ldd does not work on a.out shared libraries.

       ldd  does  not  work  with  some  extremely  old a.out programs which were built before ldd support was added to the compiler releases.  If you use ldd on one of these programs, the program will
       attempt to run with argc = 0 and the results will be unpredictable.
