NTFSCP(8)                  System Manager's Manual                  NTFSCP(8)

NAME
       ntfscp - copy file to an NTFS volume.

SYNOPSIS
       ntfscp [options] device source_file destination

DESCRIPTION
       ntfscp  will  copy  file  to an NTFS volume. destination can be either
       file or directory. In case if destination is  directory  specified  by
       name then source_file is copied into this directory, in case if desti‐
       nation is directory and specified by inode number  then  unnamed  data
       attribute  is created for this inode and source_file is copied into it
       (WARNING: it's unusual to have unnamed data streams  in  the  directo‐
       ries, think twice before specifying directory by inode number).

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfscp accepts.  Nearly all
       options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  preceded  by  -
       and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter options, that
       don't take an argument, can be combined into a  single  command,  e.g.
       -fv  is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to
       any unique prefix of their name.

       -a, --attribute NUM
              Write to this attribute.

       -i, --inode
              Treat destination as inode number.

       -m, --min-fragments
              Minimize fragmentation when allocating space to the  attribute.
              This is mostly useful when creating big files.

       -N, --attr-name NAME
              Write to attribute with this name.

       -n, --no-action
              Use  this  option to make a test run before doing the real copy
              operation.  Volume will be opened read-only and no  write  will
              be done.

       -f, --force
              This  will override some sensible defaults, such as not working
              with a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license ntfscp.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

DATA STREAMS
       All data on NTFS is stored in streams, which can have  names.  A  file
       can  have  more  than  one  data streams, but exactly one must have no
       name. The size of a file is the size of its unnamed data stream.  Usu‐
       ally when you don't specify stream name you are access to unnamed data
       stream. If you want access to  named  data  stream  you  need  to  add
       ":stream_name"    to   the   filename.   For   example:   by   opening
       "some.mp3:artist" you will open stream  "artist"  in  "some.mp3".  But
       windows  usually  prevent you from accessing to named data streams, so
       you need to use some program like FAR or utils from cygwin  to  access
       named data streams.

EXAMPLES
       Copy  new_boot.ini  from  /home/user  as  boot.ini  to  the root of an
       /dev/hda1 NTFS volume:

              ntfscp /dev/hda1 /home/user/new_boot.ini boot.ini

       Copy myfile to C:\some\path\myfile:stream (assume that /dev/hda1  let‐
       ter in windows is C):

              ntfscp -N stream /dev/hda1 myfile /some/path
