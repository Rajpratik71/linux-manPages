DRIFTNET(1)                                                   General Commands Manual                                                  DRIFTNET(1)

NAME
       driftnet - capture images from network traffic and display them in an X window; optionally, capture audio streams and play them.

SYNOPSIS
       driftnet [options] [filter code]

DESCRIPTION
       Driftnet  watches  network  traffic,  and picks out and displays JPEG and GIF images for display. It is an horrific invasion of privacy and
       shouldn't be used by anyone anywhere. It has been described as `a graphical tcpdump(8)', `EtherPeg for Unix', and called all sorts of nasty
       names  by people on Freshmeat. It is also possible to use driftnet to capture MPEG audio data from the network and play it through a player
       such as mpg123(1).

       Images may be saved by clicking on them.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print a summary of usage.

       -v     Print additional details of packets captured to the terminal.

       -b     Beep when a new image is displayed.

       -i interface
              Listen to packets on interface. By default, driftnet will try to pick up traffic on all interfaces, but this does not work with  all
              versions  of pcap(3); on such systems, an interface must be specified. On some systems, driftnet can only use promiscuous mode if an
              interface is specified.

       -f file
              Instead of listening on an interface, read captured packets from a pcap(3); dump file; file can be a named pipe for use with  Kismet
              or similar.

       -p     Do not put the interface into promiscuous mode.

       -a     Operate  in  `adjunct  mode', where driftnet gathers images for use by another program, such as Jamie Zawinski's webcollage. In this
              mode, no window is displayed; images are captured and saved in a temporary directory, and their names written on standard output.

       -m number
              In adjunct mode, silently drop images if there are more than number in the temporary directory. It is assumed that  another  process
              will delete images which it has processed.

       -x prefix
              The filename prefix to use when saving images, by default `driftnet-'.

       -d directory
              Use  directory  to store temporary files. Driftnet will clear this directory of its own temporary files on exit, but will not delete
              the directory or any other files.

       -s     Attempt to capture streamed audio data from the network, and either play it or, in adjunct mode, save it in files. At  present  this
              only works with MPEG data.

       -S     Capture streamed audio data only, ignoring images.

       -M command
              Use the named command to play MPEG audio data. The command, which is executed using the shell, should accept MPEG frames on standard
              input.  The default is `mpg123 -'.

       filter code
              Additional filter code to restrict the packets captured, in the libpcap syntax. User filter code is evaluated as  `tcp  and  (filter
              code)'.
