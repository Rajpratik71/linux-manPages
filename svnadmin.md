NAME
       svnadmin - Subversion repository administration tool

SYNOPSIS
       svnadmin command /path/to/repos [options] [args]

OVERVIEW
       Subversion is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually source code), keep a log of
       who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like CVS, RCS or SCCS.  Subversion keeps a single copy of the  master  sources.   This  copy  is
       called the source ``repository''; it contains all the information to permit extracting previous versions of those files at any time.

       For more information about the Subversion project, visit http://subversion.apache.org.
