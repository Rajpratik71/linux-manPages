NAME
       sha224sum - compute and check SHA224 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha224sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check SHA224 (224-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA224 sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

              Note: There is no difference between binary and text mode option on GNU system.

   The following four options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       --strict
              exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums are computed as described in RFC 3874.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating input
       mode ('*' for binary, space for text), and name for each FILE.
