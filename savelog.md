NAME
       savelog - save a log file

SYNOPSIS
       savelog  [-m mode] [-u user] [-g group] [-t] [-p] [-c cycle] [-l] [-j]
       [-J] [-1 .. -9] [-C] [-d] [-l] [-r rolldir] [-n] [-q] [-D  dateformat]
       file ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  savelog  command  saves  and  optionally compresses old copies of
       files.  Older versions of file are named:

              file.<number><compress_suffix>

       where <number> is the version number, 0  being  the  newest.   Version
       numbers > 0 are compressed unless -l prevents it.  Version number 0 is
       not compressed because a process might still have file opened for I/O.
       Only cycle versions of the file are kept.

       If the file does not exist and -t was given, it will be created.

       For  files  that do exist and have lengths greater than zero, the fol‐
       lowing actions are performed:

       1)     Version numbered files are cycled.  Version file.2 is moved  to
              version  file.3, version file.1 is moved to version file.2, and
              so on.  Finally version file.0 is moved to version file.1,  and
              version  file  is  deleted.   Both  compressed names and uncom‐
              pressed names are cycled, regardless of  -l.   Missing  version
              files are ignored.

       2)     The  new file.1 is compressed unless the -l flag was given.  It
              is changed subject to the -m, -u, and -g flags.

       3)     The main file is moved to file.0.

       4)     If the -m, -u, -g,  -t, or -p flags are given,  then  an  empty
              file  is created subject to the given flags.  With the -p flag,
              the file is created with the same owner, group, and permissions
              as before.

       5)     The new file.0 is changed subject to the -m, -u, and -g flags.

OPTIONS
       -m mode
              chmod the log files to mode, implies -t

       -u user
              chown log files to user, implies -t

       -g group
              chgrp log files to group, implies -t

       -c cycle
              Save  cycle  versions  of  the  logfile (default: 7). The cycle
              count must be at least 2.

       -t     touch new logfile into existence

       -l     don't compress any log files (default: do compress)

       -p     preserve owner, group, and permissions of logfile

       -j     compress with bzip2 instead of gzip

       -J     compress with xz instead of gzip

              For xz no strength option is set, and xz decides on the default
              based on the total amount of physical RAM. Note that xz can use
              a very large amount of memory for the higher  compression  lev‐
              els.

       -1 .. -9
              compression  strength  or  memory usage (default: 9, except for
              xz)

       -C     force cleanup of cycled logfiles

       -d     use standard date for rolling

       -D dateformat
              override date format, in the syntax understood by  the  date(1)
              command

       -r     use rolldir instead of . to roll files

       -n     do not rotate empty files

       -q     be quiet

BUGS
       If  a  process  is  still  writing  to file.0, and savelog moves it to
       file.1 and compresses it, data could be lost.
