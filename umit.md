NAME
       umit - network tool and port scanner

SYNOPSIS
       umit

DESCRIPTION
       umit scans the hosts in your network discovering open ports and the services and operating systems that they are running.

       With  umit, you have all the power provided by nmap through its regular command line interface, and a lot more, in a highly usable and por‐
       table graphical interface. A regular user will be able to construct powerful scans with umit's command creatiop wizards.
