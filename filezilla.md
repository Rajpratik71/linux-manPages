DESCRIPTION
       FileZilla is a powerful client for plain FTP, FTP over SSL/TLS (FTPS) and the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP).

OPTIONS
       -c <site>, --site <site>
              Connect  to  the given site from the Site Manager.  Site has to be given as complete path, with a slash as separation character. Any
              slash or backslash that is part of a segment has to be escaped with a backslash. Path has to be prefixed with  0  for  user  defined
              entries or 1 for default entries. Site path may not contain double quotation marks.

              Example: filezilla -c 0/foo/bar/sl\/ash connects to the user site sl/ash in the site directory foo/bar

              May not be used together with -s nor with URL parameter.

       -a <path>, --local <path>
              Sets the local site to the given path.

       -l <logontype>, --logontype <logontype>
              Set a special logontype, can only be used in combination with a FTP URL as argument.
