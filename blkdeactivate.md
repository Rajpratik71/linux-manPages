NAME
       blkdeactivate — utility to deactivate block devices

SYNOPSIS
       blkdeactivate [-d dm_options] [-e] [-h] [-l lvm_options] [-m mpath_options] [-r mdraid_options]
       [-u] [-v] [device]

DESCRIPTION
       The blkdeactivate utility deactivates block devices. For mounted block devices, it attempts  to
       unmount  it  automatically  before trying to deactivate. The utility currently supports device-
       mapper devices (DM), including LVM volumes and software RAID MD devices. LVM volumes  are  han‐
       dled directly using the lvm(8) command, the rest of device-mapper based devices are handled us‐
       ing the dmsetup(8) command.  MD devices are handled using the mdadm(8) command.

OPTIONS
       -d, --dmoptions dm_options
              Comma separated list of device-mapper specific  options.   Accepted  dmsetup(8)  options
              are:

              retry  Retry removal several times in case of failure.

              force  Force device removal.

       -e, --errors
              Show  errors reported from tools called by blkdeactivate. Without this option, any error
              messages from these external tools are suppressed and the blkdeactivate itself  provides
              only a summary message to indicate the device was skipped.

       -h, --help
              Display the help text.

       -l, --lvmoptions lvm_options
              Comma-separated list of LVM specific options:

              retry  Retry removal several times in case of failure.

              wholevg
                     Deactivate  the whole LVM Volume Group when processing a Logical Volume.  Deacti‐
                     vating the Volume Group as a whole is quicker than deactivating each Logical Vol‐
                     ume separately.

       -m, --mpathoptions mpath_options
              Comma-separated list of device-mapper multipath specific options:

              disablequeueing
                     Disable  queueing  on  all  multipath devices before deactivation.  This avoids a
                     situation where blkdeactivate may end up waiting if all the paths are unavailable
                     for any underlying device-mapper multipath device.

       -r, --mdraidoptions mdraid_options
              Comma-separated list of MD RAID specific options:

              wait   Wait  MD device's resync, recovery or reshape action to complete before deactiva‐
                     tion.

       -u, --umount
              Unmount a mounted device before trying to deactivate it.  Without this  option  used,  a
              device that is mounted is not deactivated.

       -v, --verbose
              Run in verbose mode. Use --vv for even more verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
       Deactivate  all  supported  block  devices  found  in the system, skipping mounted devices.   #
       blkdeactivate

       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the  system,  unmounting  any  mounted  devices
       first, if possible.   # blkdeactivate -u

       Deactivate  the  device /dev/vg/lvol0 together with all its holders, unmounting any mounted de‐
       vices first, if possible.   # blkdeactivate -u /dev/vg/lvol0

       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the system. If the deactivation  of  a  device-
       mapper device fails, retry it. Deactivate the whole Volume Group at once when processing an LVM
       Logical Volume.   # blkdeactivate -u -d retry -l wholevg

       Deactivate all supported block devices found in the system. If the deactivation  of  a  device-
       mapper device fails, retry it and force removal.   # blkdeactivate -d force,retry
