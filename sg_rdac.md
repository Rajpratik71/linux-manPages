NAME
       sg_rdac - display or modify SCSI RDAC Redundant Controller mode page

SYNOPSIS
       sg_rdac [-6] [-a] [-f=LUN] [-v] [-V] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       sg_rdac  displays  or modifies the RDAC controller settings via the Redundant Controller mode page (0x2C). When modifying the settings it allows to transfer the ownership of individual drives to the
       controller the command was received on.

OPTIONS
       -6     Use the 6 byte cdb variants of the SCSI MODE SENSE and MODE SELECT commands.  The default action (in the absence of this option) is to use the 10 byte cdb variants.

       -a     Transfer all (visible) devices

       -f=LUN Transfer the device identified by LUN. This command will only work if the controller supports 'Dual Active Mode' (aka active/active mode).

       -v     be verbose

       -V     print version string then exit

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_rdac is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
