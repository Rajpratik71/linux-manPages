NAME
       ss - another utility to investigate sockets

SYNOPSIS
       ss [options] [ FILTER ]

DESCRIPTION
       ss  is  used  to  dump socket statistics. It allows showing information similar to netstat.  It can display more TCP and state informations
       than other tools.

OPTIONS
       When no option is used ss displays a list of open non-listening sockets (e.g. TCP/UNIX/UDP) that have established connection.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Output version information.

       -H, --no-header
              Suppress header line.

       -n, --numeric
              Do not try to resolve service names.

       -r, --resolve
              Try to resolve numeric address/ports.

       -a, --all
              Display both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means established connections) sockets.

       -l, --listening
              Display only listening sockets (these are omitted by default).

       -o, --options
              Show timer information. For tcp protocol, the output format is:

              timer:(<timer_name>,<expire_time>,<retrans>)

              <timer_name>
                     the name of the timer, there are five kind of timer names:

                     on: means one of these timers: tcp retrans timer, tcp early retrans timer and tail loss probe timer

                     keepalive: tcp keep alive timer

                     timewait: timewait stage timer

                     persist: zero window probe timer

                     unknown: none of the above timers

              <expire_time>
                     how long time the timer will expire

              <retrans>
                     how many times the retran occurs

       -e, --extended
              Show detailed socket information. The output format is:

              uid:<uid_number> ino:<inode_number> sk:<cookie>

              <uid_number>
                     the user id the socket belongs to

              <inode_number>
                     the socket's inode number in VFS

              <cookie>
                     an uuid of the socket

       -m, --memory
              Show socket memory usage. The output format is:

              skmem:(r<rmem_alloc>,rb<rcv_buf>,t<wmem_alloc>,tb<snd_buf>,f<fwd_alloc>,w<wmem_queued>,o<opt_mem>,bl<back_log>)

              <rmem_alloc>
                     the memory allocated for receiving packet

              <rcv_buf>
                     the total memory can be allocated for receiving packet

              <wmem_alloc>
                     the memory used for sending packet (which has been sent to layer 3)

              <snd_buf>
                     the total memory can be allocated for sending packet

              <fwd_alloc>
                     the memory allocated by the socket as cache, but not used for receiving/sending packet yet. If need  memory  to  send/receive
                     packet, the memory in this cache will be used before allocate additional memory.

              <wmem_queued>
                     The memory allocated for sending packet (which has not been sent to layer 3)

              <opt_mem>
                     The memory used for storing socket option, e.g., the key for TCP MD5 signature

              <back_log>
                     The  memory  used  for  the  sk  backlog queue. On a process context, if the process is receiving packet, and a new packet is
                     received, it will be put into the sk backlog queue, so it can be received by the process immediately

       -p, --processes

       -K, --kill
              Attempts to forcibly close sockets. This option displays sockets that are successfully closed and silently skips  sockets  that  the
              kernel does not support closing. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 sockets only.

       -s, --summary
              Print  summary  statistics. This option does not parse socket lists obtaining summary from various sources. It is useful when amount
              of sockets is so huge that parsing /proc/net/tcp is painful.

       -Z, --context
              As the -p option but also shows process security context.

              For netlink(7) sockets the initiating process context is displayed as follows:

                     1.  If valid pid show the process context.

                     2.  If destination is kernel (pid = 0) show kernel initial context.

                     3.  If a unique identifier has been allocated by the kernel or netlink user, show context as "unavailable". This will  gener‚Äê
                         ally indicate that a process has more than one netlink socket active.

       -z, --contexts
              As  the  -Z  option  but  also shows the socket context. The socket context is taken from the associated inode and is not the actual
              socket context held by the kernel. Sockets are typically labeled with the context of the creating process, however the context shown
              will reflect any policy role, type and/or range transition rules applied, and is therefore a useful reference.

       -N NSNAME, --net=NSNAME
              Switch to the specified network namespace name.

       -b, --bpf
              Show socket BPF filters (only administrators are allowed to get these information).

       -4, --ipv4
              Display only IP version 4 sockets (alias for -f inet).

       -6, --ipv6
              Display only IP version 6 sockets (alias for -f inet6).

       -0, --packet
              Display PACKET sockets (alias for -f link).

       -t, --tcp
              Display TCP sockets.

       -u, --udp
              Display UDP sockets.

       -d, --dccp
              Display DCCP sockets.

       -w, --raw
              Display RAW sockets.

       -x, --unix
              Display Unix domain sockets (alias for -f unix).

       -S, --sctp
              Display SCTP sockets.

       --vsock
              Display vsock sockets (alias for -f vsock).

       -f FAMILY, --family=FAMILY
              Display sockets of type FAMILY.  Currently the following families are supported: unix, inet, inet6, link, netlink, vsock.

       -A QUERY, --query=QUERY, --socket=QUERY
              List  of  socket  tables  to  dump,  separated  by commas. The following identifiers are understood: all, inet, tcp, udp, raw, unix,
              packet, netlink, unix_dgram, unix_stream, unix_seqpacket, packet_raw, packet_dgram, dccp, sctp, vsock_stream, vsock_dgram.

       -D FILE, --diag=FILE
              Do not display anything, just dump raw information about TCP sockets to FILE after applying filters. If FILE is - stdout is used.

       -F FILE, --filter=FILE
              Read filter information from FILE.  Each line of FILE is interpreted like single command line option. If FILE is - stdin is used.

       FILTER := [ state STATE-FILTER ] [ EXPRESSION ]
              Please take a look at the official documentation for details regarding filters.

STATE-FILTER
       STATE-FILTER allows to construct arbitrary set of states to match. Its syntax is sequence of keywords state and exclude followed by identi‚Äê
       fier of state.

       Available identifiers are:

              All standard TCP states: established, syn-sent, syn-recv, fin-wait-1, fin-wait-2, time-wait, closed, close-wait, last-ack, listening
              and closing.

              all - for all the states

              connected - all the states except for listening and closed

              synchronized - all the connected states except for syn-sent

              bucket - states, which are maintained as minisockets, i.e.  time-wait and syn-recv

              big - opposite to bucket

              Display all TCP sockets.

       ss -o state fin-wait-1 '( sport = :http or sport = :https )' dst 193.233.7/24
              List all the tcp sockets in state FIN-WAIT-1 for our apache to network 193.233.7/24 and look at their timers.
