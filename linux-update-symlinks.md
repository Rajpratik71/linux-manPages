NAME
       linux-update-symlinks  -  maintain  symlinks  to  default  kernel  and
       initramfs

SYNOPSIS
       linux-update-symlinks {install|upgrade|remove} VERSION IMAGE-PATH

DESCRIPTION
       linux-update-symlinks is intended to be called from the  postinst  and
       postrm  maintainer  scripts  of  Linux  kernel packages.  The postinst
       script must pass the first argument install or  upgrade  depending  on
       whether a fresh installation or an upgrade has taken place.

       The  VERSION  argument  must  be the kernel version string as shown by
       uname -r and used in filenames.

       The IMAGE-PATH argument must be the absolute filename  of  the  kernel
       image.

       By  default,  this  command  maintains symlinks in the root directory.
       This behaviour can be modified by settings in /etc/kernel-img.conf:

       image_dest
              Specifies the directory in which to maintain symlinks
       link_in_boot
              If set to a true value, specifies that the directory is /boot
       no_symlinks
              If set to a false value, disables maintenance of symlinks

       The symlinks for the primary default kernel version are named  vmlinuz
       or  vmlinux  (depending on whether the architecture normally uses com‐
       pressed kernel images) and initrd.img (if it uses an initramfs).   The
       symlinks for the secondary default have the same names with the suffix
       .old.

       If symlink maintenance is disabled, linux-update-symlinks  does  noth‐
       ing,  successfully.   Otherwise  it makes a list of kernel versions in
       decreasing order of priority:

       · The given VERSION, if the first argument is install

       · The current primary default version, if it exists and is not already
         listed

       · The  current  secondary  default  version,  if  it exists and is not
         already listed

       · All other versions whose files are installed, excluding  the  speci‐
         fied  VERSION if the first argument is remove, in decreasing version
         order

       The top two entries on the list are  the  new  primary  and  secondary
       default  versions,  and  it updates the symlinks accordingly.  In case
       there is only one entry,  this  is  both  the  primary  and  secondary
       default  version.   If there are no entries, there are no default ver‐
       sions and it removes the default symlinks.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       INITRD When   the   first   argument   is    install    or    upgrade,
              linux-update-symlinks  assumes  that the given VERSION will use
              an initramfs unless this variable is set to No.

FILES

              Installed initramfs images
       /boot/vmlinuz-* | /boot/vmlinux-*

       /etc/kernel-img.conf
              Configuration file specifying whether and where to create  sym‐
              links
       /initrd.img
              Symlink to the initramfs image for the primary default version
       /initrd.img.old
              Symlink  to  the initramfs image for the secondary default ver‐
              sion
       /vmlinuz | /vmlinux
              Symlink to the kernel image for the primary default version
       /vmlinuz.old | /vmlinux.old
