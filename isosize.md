NAME
       isosize - output the length of an iso9660 filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       isosize [options] iso9660_image_file

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  outputs  the  length  of an iso9660 filesystem that is contained in the specified file.  This file may be a normal file or a
       block device (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0).  In the absence of any options (and errors), it will output the size of the iso9660 filesystem in
       bytes.  This can now be a large number (>> 4 GB).

OPTIONS
       -x, --sectors
              Show the block count and block size in human-readable form.  The output uses the term "sectors" for "blocks".

       -d, --divisor number
              Only has an effect when -x is not given.  The value shown (if no errors) is the iso9660 file size in bytes divided by number.  So if
              number is the block size then the shown value will be the block count.

       The size of the file (or block device) holding an iso9660 filesystem can be marginally larger than the actual size of the iso9660  filesys‐
       tem.  One reason for this is that cd writers are allowed to add "run out" sectors at the end of an iso9660 image.

AVAILABILITY
       The  isosize  command  is part of the util-linux package and is available from Linux Kernel Archive ⟨https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils
       /util-linux/⟩.
