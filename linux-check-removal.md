LINUX-CHECK-REMOVAL(1)     General Commands Manual     LINUX-CHECK-REMOVAL(1)

NAME
       linux-check-removal - check whether removal of a kernel is safe

SYNOPSIS
       linux-check-removal VERSION

DESCRIPTION
       linux-check-removal is intended to be called from the prerm maintainer
       scripts of Linux kernel packages.

       The VERSION argument must be the kernel version  string  as  shown  by
       uname -r and used in filenames.

       If  the  currently running kernel matches VERSION, linux-check-removal
       normally prompts the user to confirm this potentially dangerous action
       and  fails  if the user chooses to abort.  There are two exceptions to
       this behaviour:

       · If the current environment is a chroot or container, it  is  assumed
         that the running kernel is independent of any installed kernel pack‐
         age and the command always quietly succeeds

       · If debconf prompts are disabled, the command warns if  removing  the
         running kernel but always succeeds

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DEBIAN_FRONTEND
              Name of the preferred debconf front-end.  If set to noninterac‐
              tive, debconf  prompts  are  disabled  and  linux-check-removal
              always quietly succeeds.
       DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_PACKAGE
              Name of the package to be removed, automatically set by dpkg.
