NAME
       runcon - run command with specified SELinux security context

SYNOPSIS
       runcon CONTEXT COMMAND [args]
       runcon [ -c ] [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-t TYPE] [-l RANGE] COMMAND [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run COMMAND with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current or transitioned security context modified by one or more of LEVEL, ROLE, TYPE, and USER.

       If none of -c, -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first argument is used as the complete context.  Any additional arguments after COMMAND are interpreted as arguments to the command.

       Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are likely to successfully run.

       Run a program in a different SELinux security context.  With neither CONTEXT nor COMMAND, print the current security context.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
