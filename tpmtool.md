NAME
       tpmtool - GnuTLS TPM tool

SYNOPSIS
       tpmtool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       All arguments must be options.


DESCRIPTION
       Program that allows handling cryptographic data from the TPM chip.

OPTIONS
       -d number, --debug=number
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       --infile=file
              Input file.


       --outfile=string
              Output file.


       --generate-rsa
              Generate an RSA private-public key pair.

              Generates an RSA private-public key pair in the TPM chip.  The key may be stored in filesystem and protected by a PIN, or stored (registered) in the TPM chip flash.

       --register
              Any generated key will be registered in the TPM.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: generate-rsa.


       --signing
              Any generated key will be a signing key.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: generate-rsa.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the follow‚Äê
              ing options: legacy.


       --legacy
              Any generated key will be a legacy key.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: generate-rsa.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: signing.


       --user Any registered key will be a user key.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: register.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: system.

              The generated key will be stored in a user specific persistent storage.

       --system
              Any registred key will be a system key.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: register.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: user.

              The generated key will be stored in system persistent storage.

       --pubkey=url
              Prints the public key of the provided key.


       --list Lists all stored keys in the TPM.


       --delete=url
              Delete the key identified by the given URL (UUID)..


       --test-sign=url
              Tests the signature operation of the provided object.

              It can be used to test the correct operation of the signature operation.  This operation will sign and verify the signed data.

       --sec-param=security parameter
              Specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high, ultra]..

              This is alternative to the bits option. Note however that the values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be rounded up.

       --bits=number
              Specify the number of bits for key generate.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.


       --inder, --no-inder
              Use the DER format for keys..  The no-inder form will disable the option.

              The input files will be assumed to be in the portable DER format of TPM. The default format is a custom format used by various TPM tools

       --outder, --no-outder
              Use DER format for output keys.  The no-outder form will disable the option.

              The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       -v [{v|c|n --version [{v|c|n}]}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

EXAMPLES
       To generate a key that is to be stored in filesystem use:
           $ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --outfile tpmkey.pem

       To generate a key that is to be stored in TPM's flash use:
           $ tpmtool --generate-rsa --bits 2048 --register --user

       To get the public key of a TPM key use:
           $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:uuid=58ad734b-bde6-45c7-89d8-756a55ad1891;storage=user           --outfile pubkey.pem

       or if the key is stored in the filesystem:
           $ tpmtool --pubkey tpmkey:file=tmpkey.pem --outfile pubkey.pem

       To list all keys stored in TPM use:
           $ tpmtool --list

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
              Successful program execution.

       1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
              The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

       70  (EX_SOFTWARE)
              libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
