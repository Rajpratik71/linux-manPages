NAME
       bstyleconvert - a Blackbox style conversion utility

SYNOPSIS
       bstyleconvert files...

DESCRIPTION
       Blackbox 0.70+ is committed to fully support the style syntax of previous versions, thus allowing older styles to be loaded and used.  How‐
       ever, if one of your favorite styles seems 'broken', you can try this utility.

       bstyleconvert reads given old Blackbox style file(s) (<= 0.65) and produces according new style file(s), appending '-new' to original file‐
       name(s).

OPTIONS
       This program does not support (nor need) any options.

SEE ALSO
