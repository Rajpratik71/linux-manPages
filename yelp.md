NAME
       yelp — browse system documentation

USAGE
       yelp [file]

       The GNOME Help Browser includes detailed documentation for the majority of applications, utili‐
       ties and other components, such as the panel or the Nautilus file manager.

       Yelp can display some HTML and XML files when passed on the command-line,  but  it's  primarily
       called from applications.

       You  can  also  start Yelp by choosing Desktop->Help.  This will show the top-level help system
       page, listing all GNOME documents conveniently organized by topic.

OPTIONS
       This program accepts all the standard GNOME and GTK+ options, which follow the usual  GNU  com‐
       mand  line  syntax,  with  long options starting with two dashes (`-'). To get more information
       about these options launch Yelp with the `--help' argument.
