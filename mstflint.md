              tion is currently using the flash.  Exercise caution.

       --qq   :  Run  a  quick query. When specified, flint will not perform full image integrity checks during the query operation. This may shorten execution time when running over slow interfaces (e.g.,
              I2C, MTUSB-1).  Commands affected: query

              the firmware to hang.

       --no_flash_verify
              : Do not verify each write on the flash.

       --use_fw
