NAME
       update-motd - immediately update the dynamic MOTD and print it to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       update-motd

DESCRIPTION
       The PAM MOTD module updates the Message-of-the-Day automatically on user logins.

       But sometimes, the system administrator may want to update the MOTD immediately or on demand.

       This simple program performs the same actions handled by PAM on login, and prints the new MOTD to stdout.

       Note that only the system administrator can typically write to the MOTD, and thus this utility should be executed as the root user.

       For best practices and additional information, please see update-motd(5).

FILES
