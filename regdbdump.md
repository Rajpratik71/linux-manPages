NAME
       regdbdump - parse and print out regulatory rules file

SYNOPSIS
       regdbdump <path-to-regulatory.bin>

Description
       regdbdump can be used to parse the regulatory.bin file, the Linux wireless regulatory database
       used by crda, and print out its contents in human readable format.  regdbdump will return non
       zero if the digital signature regdbdump was built with cannot verify the signature of the regu‚Äê
       latory database.  Should this happen unintentionally chances are your regulatory.bin file is
       corrupted or has been tampered with.
