       hd - MFM/IDE hard disk devices

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The hhdd** devices are block devices to access MFM/IDE hard disk drives in
       raw mode.  The master drive on the primary IDE controller (major device
       number 3) is hhddaa; the slave drive is hhddbb.  The master drive of the
       second controller (major device number 22) is hhddcc and the slave is hhdddd.

       General IDE block device names have the form hhdd_X, or hhdd_X_P, where _X is a
       letter denoting the physical drive, and _P is a number denoting the
       partition on that physical drive.  The first form, hhdd_X, is used to
       address the whole drive.  Partition numbers are assigned in the order
       the partitions are discovered, and only nonempty, nonextended
       partitions get a number.  However, partition numbers 1â€“4 are given to
       the four partitions described in the MBR (the "primary" partitions),
       regardless of whether they are unused or extended.  Thus, the first
       logical partition will be hhdd_X55.  Both DOS-type partitioning and BSD-
       disklabel partitioning are supported.  You can have at most 63
       partitions on an IDE disk.

       For example, _/_d_e_v_/_h_d_a refers to all of the first IDE drive in the
       system; and _/_d_e_v_/_h_d_b_3 refers to the third DOS "primary" partition on
       the second one.

       They are typically created by:

           mknod -m 660 /dev/hda b 3 0
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hda1 b 3 1
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hda2 b 3 2
           ...
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hda8 b 3 8
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb b 3 64
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb1 b 3 65
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb2 b 3 66
           ...
           mknod -m 660 /dev/hdb8 b 3 72
           chown root:disk /dev/hd*
