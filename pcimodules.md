NAME
       pcimodules - List kernel driver modules available for all currently plugged in PCI devices

SYNOPSIS
       pcimodules [--classclass_id] [--classmaskmask] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       pcimodules  lists all driver modules for all currently plugged in PCI devices.  pcimodules should be run at boot time, and whenever a PCI device is "hot plugged" into the system.  This can be
       done by the following Bourne shell syntax:

                   for module in $(pcimodules) ; do

                        modprobe -s "$module"

                   done

       When a PCI device is removed from the system, the Linux kernel will decrement a usage count on PCI driver module.  If this count drops to zero (i.e., there are no PCI drivers), then the  mod‐
       probe -r process that is normally configured to run from cron every few minutes will eventually remove the unneeded module.

       The --class and --classmask arguments can be used to limit the search to certain classes of PCI devices.  This is useful, for example, to generate a list of ethernet card drivers to be loaded
       when the kernel has indicated that it is trying to resolve an unknown network interface.

       Modules are listed in the order in which the PCI devices are physically arranged so that the computer owner can arrange things like having scsi device 0 be on a controller that is not  alpha‐
       betically the first scsi controller.

OPTIONS
       --class class --classmask mask

       --class  and  --classmask limit the search to PCI cards in particular classes.  These arguments are always used together.  The arguments to --class and --classmask can be given as hexadecimal
       numbers by prefixing a leading "0x".  Note that the classes used by pcimodules are in "Linux" format, meaning the class value that you see with lspci would be shifted left  eight  bits,  with
       the new low eight bits programming interface ID.  An examples of how to use class and classmask is provided below.  --help, -h Print a help message and exit.

EXAMPLES
       pcimodules
              lists all modules corresponding to currently plugged in PCI devices.

       pcimodules --class 0x20000 --classmask 0xffff00
              lists all modules corresponding to currently plugged in ethernet PCI devices.

FILES
       /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/modules.pcimap
              This file is automatically generated by depmod, and used by pcimodules to determine which modules correspond to which PCI ID's.

       /proc/bus/pci
              An  interface to PCI bus configuration space provided by the post-2.1.82 Linux kernels. Contains per-bus subdirectories with per-card config space files and a devices file containing a
              list of all PCI devices.
