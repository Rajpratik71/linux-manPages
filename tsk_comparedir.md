TSK_COMPAREDIR(1)                                             General Commands Manual                                            TSK_COMPAREDIR(1)

NAME
       tsk_comparedir - compare the contents of a directory with the contents of an image or local device.

SYNOPSIS
       tsk_comparedir  [-vV]  [-n  start_inum  ]  [ -f fstype ] [ -i imgtype ] [ -b dev_sector_size ] [ -o sector_offset ] image [images] compari‚Äê
       son_directory

DESCRIPTION
       tsk_comparedir compares the contents of image to the contents of comparison_directory.  This can be useful for detecting rootkits and  when
       testing.   Rootkits  can  be  detected by comparing the contents of a local directory and a local raw device.  The rootkits typically don't
       hide data when it is read directly from the raw device.

       The arguments are as follows:

       -o sector_offset
              Sector offset for a partition in the image or device to compare with.

       -n start_inum
              Starting inum for a directory in the image to start the comparison at.

       -v     verbose output to stderr

       -V     Print version

       -f fstype
              Specify the file system type.  Use '-f list' to list the supported file system types.  If not given, autodetection methods are used.

       -i imgtype
              The format of the image file, such as raw.  Use '-i list' to list the supported types.  If  not  given,  autodetection  methods  are
              used.

       -b dev_sector_size
              The size (in bytes) of the device sectors.  If not given, autodetection methods are used.

       image [images]
              The  disk or partition image to read, whose format is given with '-i'.  Multiple image file names can be given if the image is split
              into multiple segments.  If only one image file is given, and its name is the first in a sequence (e.g., as indicated by  ending  in
              '.001'), subsequent image segments will be included automatically.

EXAMPLES
       To compare the directories in image.dd to those in directory:

            # tsk_comparedir ./image.dd ./directory
