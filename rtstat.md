NAME
       lnstat - unified linux network statistics

SYNOPSIS
       lnstat [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lnstat command.

       lnstat  is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the
       old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print a selec‐
       tion  of  statistical  values  exported by the kernel.  In addition to
       routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of statistics the linux
       kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.

       Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the column
       names.  These names are used by lnstat as  keys  for  selecting  which
       statistics  to print. For every CPU present in the system, a line fol‐
       lows which lists the actual values for each column of the file. lnstat
       sums  these  values  up  (which  in fact are counters) before printing
       them. After each interval, only the difference to the  last  value  is
       printed.

       Files  and  columns may be selected by using the -f and -k parameters.
       By default, all columns of all files are printed.

OPTIONS
       lnstat supports the following options.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.

       -c, --count <count>
              Print <count> number of intervals.

       -d, --dump
              Dump list of available files/keys.

       -f, --file <file>
              Statistics file to use, may be  specified  multiple  times.  By
              default all files in /proc/net/stat are scanned.

       -i, --interval <intv>
              Set interval to 'intv' seconds.

       -j, --json
              Display results in JSON format

       -k, --keys k,k,k,...
              Display  only  keys  specified.  Each  key  k  is  of  the form
              [file:]key. If <file> is given, the search for the given key is
              limited  to  that file. Otherwise the first file containing the
              searched key is being used.

       -s, --subject [0-2]
              Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at  all,
              '1' prints a header only at start of the program and '2' prints
              a header every 20 lines.

       -w, --width n,n,n,...
              Width for each field.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       # lnstat -d
              Get a list of supported statistics files.

       # lnstat -k arp_cache:entries,rt_cache:in_hit,arp_cache:destroys
              Select the specified files and keys.

       # lnstat -i 10
              Use an interval of 10 seconds.

       # lnstat -f ip_conntrack
              Use only the specified file for statistics.

       # lnstat -s 0
              Do not print a header at all.

       # lnstat -s 20
              Print a header at start and every 20 lines.

       # lnstat -c -1 -i 1 -f rt_cache -k entries,in_hit,in_slow_tot
              Display statistics for keys entries, in_hit and in_slow_tot  of
              field rt_cache every second.

FILES

              Statistics  around  neighbor  cache  and  ARP. arp_cache is for
              IPv4, ndisc_cache is the same for IPv6.

              allocs How many neighbor entries have been allocated.

              destroys How many neighbor entries have been removed.

              hash_grows How often the neighbor (hash) table was increased.

              lookups How many lookups were performed.

              hits How many lookups were successful.

              res_failed How many neighbor lookups failed.

              cuted.

              forced_gc_runs  How  many  forced  garbage collection runs were
              executed. Happens when adding an entry and  the  table  is  too
              full.

              unresolved_discards  How  many neighbor table entries were dis‐
              carded due to lookup failure.

              table_fulls Number of table overflows. Happens if table is full
              and forced GC run (see forced_gc_runs) has failed.

       /proc/net/stat/ip_conntrack, /proc/net/stat/nf_conntrack
              Conntrack  related counters. ip_conntrack is for backwards com‐

              drop Number of packets dropped due to conntrack failure. Either
              new  conntrack  entry  allocation  failed,  or  protocol helper
              dropped the packet.

              early_drop Number of dropped conntrack entries to make room for
              new ones, if maximum table size was reached.

              icmp_error  Number of packets which could not be tracked due to
              error situation. This is a subset of invalid.
