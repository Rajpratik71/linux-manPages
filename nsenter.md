NAME
       nsenter - run program with namespaces of other processes

SYNOPSIS
       nsenter [options] [program [arguments]]

DESCRIPTION
       Enters the namespaces of one or more other processes and then executes the specified program. If program is not given, then ``${SHELL}'' is
       run (default: /bin/sh).

       Enterable namespaces are:

       mount namespace
              Mounting and unmounting filesystems will not affect the rest of the system, except for filesystems which are  explicitly  marked  as
              shared  (with  mount --make-shared; see /proc/self/mountinfo for the shared flag).  For further details, see mount_namespaces(7) and
              the discussion of the CLONE_NEWNS flag in clone(2).

       UTS namespace
              Setting hostname or domainname will not affect the rest of the system.  For further details, see namespaces(7) and the discussion of
              the CLONE_NEWUTS flag in clone(2).

       IPC namespace
              The  process  will  have  an  independent  namespace for POSIX message queues as well as System V message queues, semaphore sets and
              shared memory segments.  For further details, see namespaces(7) and the discussion of the CLONE_NEWIPC flag in clone(2).

       network namespace
              The process will have independent IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the /proc/net and  /sys/class/net  direc‐
              tory trees, sockets, etc.  For further details, see namespaces(7) and the discussion of the CLONE_NEWNET flag in clone(2).

       PID namespace
              Children will have a set of PID to process mappings separate from the nsenter process For further details, see pid_namespaces(7) and
              the discussion of the CLONE_NEWPID flag in nsenter will fork by default if changing the PID namespace, so that the new  program  and
              its  children  share  the  same  PID namespace and are visible to each other.  If --no-fork is used, the new program will be exec'ed
              without forking.

       user namespace
              The process will have a distinct set of UIDs, GIDs and capabilities.  For further details, see user_namespaces(7) and the discussion
              of the CLONE_NEWUSER flag in clone(2).

       cgroup namespace
              The  process  will  have a virtualized view of /proc/self/cgroup, and new cgroup mounts will be rooted at the namespace cgroup root.
              For further details, see cgroup_namespaces(7) and the discussion of the CLONE_NEWCGROUP flag in clone(2).

       See clone(2) for the exact semantics of the flags.

OPTIONS
       Various of the options below that relate to namespaces take an optional file argument.  This should be one of  the  /proc/[pid]/ns/*  files
       described in namespaces(7).

       -a, --all
              Enter  all namespaces of the target process by the default /proc/[pid]/ns/* namespace paths. The default paths to the target process
              namespaces may be overwritten by namespace specific options (e.g. --all --mount=[path]).

              The user namespace will be ignored if the same as the caller's current user namespace. It prevents a caller that has  dropped  capa‐
              bilities from regaining those capabilities via a call to setns().  See setns(2) for more details.

       -t, --target pid
              Specify a target process to get contexts from.  The paths to the contexts specified by pid are:

              /proc/pid/ns/mnt    the mount namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/uts    the UTS namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/ipc    the IPC namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/net    the network namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/pid    the PID namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/user   the user namespace
              /proc/pid/ns/cgroup the cgroup namespace
              /proc/pid/root      the root directory
              /proc/pid/cwd       the working directory respectively

       -m, --mount[=file]
              Enter  the  mount namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the mount namespace of the target process.  If file is specified, enter
              the mount namespace specified by file.

       -u, --uts[=file]
              Enter the UTS namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the UTS namespace of the target process.  If file is specified,  enter  the
              UTS namespace specified by file.

       -i, --ipc[=file]
              Enter  the  IPC namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the IPC namespace of the target process.  If file is specified, enter the
              IPC namespace specified by file.

       -n, --net[=file]
              Enter the network namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the network namespace of the target process.   If  file  is  specified,
              enter the network namespace specified by file.

       -p, --pid[=file]
              Enter  the  PID namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the PID namespace of the target process.  If file is specified, enter the
              PID namespace specified by file.

       -U, --user[=file]
              Enter the user namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the user namespace of the target process.  If file is specified, enter the
              user namespace specified by file.  See also the --setuid and --setgid options.

       -C, --cgroup[=file]
              Enter the cgroup namespace.  If no file is specified, enter the cgroup namespace of the target process.  If file is specified, enter
              the cgroup namespace specified by file.

       -G, --setgid gid
              Set the group ID which will be used in the entered namespace and drop supplementary groups.  nsenter(1) always  sets  GID  for  user
              namespaces, the default is 0.

       -S, --setuid uid
              Set the user ID which will be used in the entered namespace.  nsenter(1) always sets UID for user namespaces, the default is 0.

       --preserve-credentials
              Don't modify UID and GID when enter user namespace. The default is to drops supplementary groups and sets GID and UID to 0.

       -r, --root[=directory]
              Set  the  root  directory.   If  no  directory is specified, set the root directory to the root directory of the target process.  If
              directory is specified, set the root directory to the specified directory.

       -w, --wd[=directory]
              Set the working directory.  If no directory is specified, set the working directory to the working directory of the target  process.
              If directory is specified, set the working directory to the specified directory.

       -F, --no-fork
              Do  not  fork  before  exec'ing the specified program.  By default, when entering a PID namespace, nsenter calls fork before calling
              exec so that any children will also be in the newly entered PID namespace.

       -Z, --follow-context
              Set the SELinux security context used for executing a new process according to already running process specified  by  --target  PID.
              (The util-linux has to be compiled with SELinux support otherwise the option is unavailable.)

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.
