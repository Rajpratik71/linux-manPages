NAME
       linux-version - operate on Linux kernel version strings

SYNOPSIS
       linux-version compare VERSION1 OP VERSION2

       linux-version sort [--reverse] [VERSION1 VERSION2 ...]

       linux-version list [--paths]

DESCRIPTION
       linux-version  operates on Linux kernel version strings as reported by
       uname -r and used in file and directory names.  These version  strings
       do  not  follow  the  same rules as Debian package version strings and
       should not be compared as such or as arbitrary strings.

       compare VERSION1 OP VERSION2
              Compare  version  strings,  where  OP  is  a  binary  operator.
              linux-version  returns  success  (zero result) if the specified
              condition is satisfied, and failure (nonzero result) otherwise.
              The valid operators are: lt le eq ne ge gt

       sort [--reverse] [VERSION1 VERSION2 ...]
              Sort  the  given  version  strings and print them in order from
              lowest to highest.  If the --reverse option is used, print them
              in order from highest to lowest.

              If  no  version  strings  are  given  as arguments, the version
              strings will instead be read from standard input, one per line.
              They  may  be  suffixed  by arbitrary text after a space, which
              will be included in the output.  This means that, for example:

              linux-version list --paths | linux-version sort --reverse

              will list the installed versions  and  corresponding  paths  in
              order from highest to lowest version.

       list [--paths]
              List  kernel  versions installed in the customary location.  If
              the --paths option, show the corresponding path for  each  ver‐
              sion.
