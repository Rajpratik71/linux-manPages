NAME
       reged - utility to export/import and edit a Windows registry hives

SYNOPSIS
       reged [options] -x<registryhivefile><prefixstring><key><output.reg>

       reged [options] -I<registryhivefile><prefixstring><input.reg>

       reged [options] -e<registryhivefile>

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the reged command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original pro‚Äê
       gram does not have a manual page.

       reged is the an interactive command line utility that can be used to export, import or edit a Microsoft Windows registry hive.

OPTIONS
       -h     Show summary of options.

       -x <registryhivefile> <prefixstring> <key> <output.reg>
              Export parts of a hive file to a text registry (.reg)  file.  Prefixstring indicates the part of the  registry  hive  to  dump  (for
              example HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE). The <key> parameter defines the key to dump (recursively). You can use \ or \\ to list all the
              keys in the hive file.

              Only one hive file and one .reg file can be defined.

       -I <registryhivefile> <prefixstring> <input.reg>
              Import the content of the input.reg file into the registry file.  The value <prefixstring> can be any valid prefix, for  example  is
              HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE.

              Only one .reg and one hive file supported at the same time

       -e <registryhive> ...
              Interactive edit one or more registry files.

       -L     Log  all  changed  filenames  to /tmp/changed. When this option is set the program automatically saves the changes in the hive files
              without prompting the user.

              Be careful when using the -L option as a root user in a multiuser system.  The filename is fixed and this can be used  by  malicious
              users (dropping a symlink with the same name) to overwrite system files.

       -C     Automatically save all changes. Do not prompt the user.

       -N     Do not allocate more information, only allow the editing of existing values with same size.

       -E     Do not expand the hive file (safe mode).

       -t     Print debug information of allocated blocks.

       -v     Print verbose information and debug messages.
