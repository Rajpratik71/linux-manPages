NAME
       virt-copy-out - Copy files and directories out of a virtual machine disk image.

SYNOPSIS
        virt-copy-out -a disk.img /file|dir [/file|dir ...] localdir

        virt-copy-out -d domain /file|dir [/file|dir ...] localdir

DESCRIPTION
       "virt-copy-out" copies files and directories out of a virtual machine disk image or named libvirt domain.

       You can give one of more filenames and directories on the command line.  Directories are copied out recursively.

EXAMPLES
       Download the home directories from a virtual machine:

        mkdir homes
        virt-copy-out -d MyGuest /home homes

JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH
       This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the guestfish(1) "copy-out" command.  For anything more complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish
       directly.

OPTIONS
       Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full list of options.

SEE ALSO
