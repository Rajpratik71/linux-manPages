NAME
       mandb - create or update the manual page index caches

SYNOPSIS
       mandb [-dqsucpt?V] [-C file] [manpath]
       mandb [-dqsut] [-C file] -f filename ...

DESCRIPTION
       mandb  is  used to initialise or manually update index database caches
       that are usually maintained by man.  The  caches  contain  information
       relevant to the current state of the manual page system and the infor‐
       mation stored within them is used by the man-db utilities  to  enhance
       their speed and functionality.

       When  creating  or  updating an index, mandb will warn of bad ROFF .so
       requests, bogus manual page filenames and manual pages from which  the
       whatis cannot be parsed.

       Supplying  mandb  with  an optional colon-delimited path will override
       the internal system manual page hierarchy search path, determined from
       information found within the man-db configuration file.

DATABASE CACHES
       mandb  can be compiled with support for any one of the following data‐
       base types.

       Name          Type                   Async   Filename
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Berkeley db   Binary tree            Yes     index.bt
       GNU gdbm      Hashed                 Yes     index.db
       UNIX ndbm     Hashed                 No      index.(dir|pag)

       Those  database  types  that  support  asynchronous  updates   provide
       enhanced  speed  at  the  cost  of possible corruption in the event of
       unusual termination.  In an unusual case where this has  occurred,  it
       may  be  necessary  to rerun mandb with the -c option to re-create the
       databases from scratch.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -q, --quiet
              Produce no warnings.

       -s, --no-straycats
              Do not spend time looking for  or  adding  information  to  the
              databases regarding stray cats.

       -p, --no-purge
              Do not spend time checking for deleted manual pages and purging
              them from the databases.

       -c, --create
              By default, mandb will try to  update  any  previously  created
              databases.   If  a  database does not exist, it will create it.
              This option forces mandb to delete previous databases  and  re-
              create  them from scratch, and implies --no-purge.  This may be
              necessary if a database becomes corrupt or if  a  new  database
              storage scheme is introduced in the future.

       -u, --user-db
              Create  user databases only, even with write permissions neces‐
              sary to create system databases.

       -t, --test
              Perform correctness checks on manual  pages  in  the  hierarchy
              search  path.   With this option, mandb will not alter existing
              databases.

       -f, --filename
              Update only the entries for the given filename.  This option is
              not  for  general use; it is used internally by man when it has
              been compiled with the MAN_DB_UPDATES option and finds  that  a
              page is out of date.  It implies -p and disables -c and -s.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use  this  user  configuration  file rather than the default of
              ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message, then exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Show the version, then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax, or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process failed.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following warning messages can be emitted during  database  build‐
       ing.

       <filename>: whatis parse for page(sec) failed
              An  attempt to extract whatis line(s) from the given <filename>
              failed.  This is usually due to a poorly written  manual  page,
              but  if  many  such  messages are emitted it is likely that the
              system contains non-standard manual pages which are  incompati‐
              ble with the man-db whatis parser.  See the WHATIS PARSING sec‐
              tion in lexgrog(1) for more information.

       <filename>: is a dangling symlink
              <filename> does not exist but is referenced by a symbolic link.
              Further  diagnostics are usually emitted to identify the <file‐
              name> of the offending link.

       <filename>: bad symlink or ROFF `.so' request
              <filename> is either a symbolic link to,  or  contains  a  ROFF
              include request to, a non existent file.

       <filename>: ignoring bogus filename
              The  <filename>  may  or may not be a valid manual page but its
              name is invalid.  This is usually due to  a  manual  page  with
              sectional extension <x> being put in manual page section <y>.

       <filename_mask>: competing extensions
              The  wildcard  <filename_mask>  is not unique.  This is usually
              caused by the existence of both a compressed  and  uncompressed
              version  of  the same manual page.  All but the most recent are
              ignored.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /var/cache/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An FHS compliant global index database cache.

       Older locations for the database cache included:

       /usr/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              A traditional global index database cache.

       /var/catman/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An alternate or FSSTND compliant global index database cache.
