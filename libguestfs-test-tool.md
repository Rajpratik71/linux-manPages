NAME
       libguestfs-test-tool - Diagnostics for libguestfs

SYNOPSIS
        libguestfs-test-tool [--options]

DESCRIPTION
       libguestfs-test-tool is a test program shipped with libguestfs to allow you to check basic libguestfs functionality is working.  This is needed because libguestfs occasionally breaks for reasons
       beyond our control: usually because of changes in the underlying qemu or kernel packages, or the host environment.

       If you suspect a problem in libguestfs, then just run:

        libguestfs-test-tool

       It will print lots of diagnostic messages.

       If it runs to completion successfully, you will see this near the end:

        ===== TEST FINISHED OK =====

       and the test tool will exit with code 0.

       If it fails (and/or exits with non-zero error code), please paste the complete, unedited output of the test tool into a bug report.  More information about reporting bugs can be found on the
       http://libguestfs.org/ website.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display short usage information and exit.

       --qemu qemu_binary
           If you have downloaded another qemu binary, point this option at the full path of the binary to try it.

       --qemudir qemu_source_dir
           If you have compiled qemu from source, point this option at the source directory to try it.

       -t N
       --timeout N
           Set the launch timeout to "N" seconds.  The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes) which does not usually need to be adjusted.

       -V
       --version
           Display the libguestfs version number and exit.

TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU
       If you have compiled another version of qemu from source and would like to try that, then you can use the --qemudir option to point to the qemu source directory.

       If you have downloaded a qemu binary from somewhere, use the --qemu option to point to the binary.

       Note when using these options, you can ignore the business of qemu wrapper scripts ("QEMU WRAPPERS" in guestfs(3)), since libguestfs-test-tool writes a wrapper script for you if one is needed.

TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT KERNEL
       You can tell supermin to try a different kernel.  You do this by setting the environment variables "SUPERMIN_KERNEL", "SUPERMIN_KERNEL_VERSION" and/or "SUPERMIN_MODULES".

       Refer to "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES" in supermin(1) for further information.

TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF LIBVIRT
       To find out which backend is the default in your libguestfs package, do:

        unset LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND
        guestfish get-backend

       If you are using the libvirt backend, then you can try out a different (eg. upstream) version of libvirt by running these commands (not as root):

        killall libvirtd lt-libvirtd
        ~/path/to/libvirt/run libguestfs-test-tool

       The first command kills any session "libvirtd" process(es) that may be running on the machine.  The second command uses libvirt's "run" script (in the top-level libvirt build directory) to set
       some environment variables so that the alternate version of libvirt is used to run the program.

TRYING OUT WITH / WITHOUT LIBVIRT
       To find out which backend is the default in your libguestfs package, do:

        unset LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND
        guestfish get-backend

       If you are using the libvirt backend, you can try without (ie. libguestfs directly launching qemu) by doing:

        export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct

       Or if you are using the default (direct) backend, then you can try libvirt:

        export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=libvirt

       or with libvirt and a specific libvirt URI:

        export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=libvirt:qemu:///session

TRYING OUT DIFFERENT SELINUX SETTINGS
       To find out which backend is the default in your libguestfs package, do:

        unset LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND
        guestfish get-backend

       To find out if SELinux is being used, do:

        getenforce

       If you are using libvirt, SELinux and sVirt, then you can try to see if changing SELinux to "permissive" mode makes any difference.  Use this command as root:

        setenforce Permissive

       If this makes a difference, look in the audit logs for recent failures ("AVCs"):

        ausearch -m avc -ts recent

       You can convert AVCs into suggested SELinux policy rules using tools like audit2allow(1).  For more information, see the "Security Enhanced Linux User Guide".

       To reenable SELinux and sVirt, do:

        setenforce Enforcing

SELF-DIAGNOSIS
       Refer to "APPLIANCE BOOT PROCESS" in guestfs(3) to understand the messages produced by libguestfs-test-tool and/or possible errors.

EXIT STATUS
       libguestfs-test-tool returns 0 if the tests completed without error, or 1 if there was an error.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       For the full list of environment variables which may affect libguestfs, please see the guestfs(3) manual page.
