NAME
       danetool - GnuTLS DANE tool

SYNOPSIS
       danetool [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       All arguments must be options.


DESCRIPTION
       Tool to generate and check DNS resource records for the DANE protocol.

OPTIONS
       -d number, --debug=number
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       -V, --verbose
              More verbose output.  This option may appear an unlimited number of times.


       --infile=file
              Input file.


       --outfile=string
              Output file.


       --load-pubkey=string
              Loads a public key file.

              This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL

       --load-certificate=string
              Loads a certificate file.

              This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL

       --dlv=string
              Sets a DLV file.

              This sets a DLV file to be used for DNSSEC verification.

       --hash=string
              Hash algorithm to use for signing.

              Available hash functions are SHA1, RMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512.

       --check=string
              Check a host's DANE TLSA entry.

              Obtains the DANE TLSA entry from the given hostname and prints information. Note that the actual certificate of the host can be provided using --load-certificate, otherwise danetool will con‚Äê
              nect to the server to obtain it. The exit code on verification success will be zero.

       --check-ee
              Check only the end-entity's certificate.

              Checks the end-entity's certificate only. Trust anchors or CAs are not considered.

       --check-ca
              Check only the CA's certificate.

              Checks the trust anchor's and CA's certificate only. End-entities are not considered.

       --tlsa-rr
              Print the DANE RR data on a certificate or public key.  This option must appear in combination with the following options: host.

              This command prints the DANE RR data needed to enable DANE on a DNS server.

       --host=hostname
              Specify the hostname to be used in the DANE RR.

              This command sets the hostname for the DANE RR.

       --proto=protocol
              The protocol set for DANE data (tcp, udp etc.).

              This command specifies the protocol for the service set in the DANE data.

       --port=number
              Specify the port number for the DANE data.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.


       --app-proto=string
              The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap).

              When the server's certificate isn't provided danetool will connect to the server to obtain the certificate. In that case it is required to known the protocol to talk with the server prior to
              initiating the TLS handshake.

       --ca   Whether the provided certificate or public key is a Certificate Authority.

              Marks the DANE RR as a CA certificate if specified.

       --x509 Use the hash of the X.509 certificate, rather than the public key.

              This option forces the generated record to contain the hash of the full X.509 certificate. By default only the hash of the public key is used.

       --local
              This is an alias for the --domain option.

       --domain, --no-domain
              The provided certificate or public key is issued by the local domain.  The no-domain form will disable the option.  This option is enabled by default.

              DANE distinguishes certificates and public keys offered via the DNSSEC to trusted and local entities. This flag indicates that this is a domain-issued certificate, meaning that there could be
              no CA involved.

       --local-dns, --no-local-dns
              Use the local DNS server for DNSSEC resolving.  The no-local-dns form will disable the option.

              This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC.  This is disabled by default due to many servers not allowing DNSSEC.

       --insecure
              Do not verify any DNSSEC signature.

              Ignores any DNSSEC signature verification results.

       --inder, --no-inder
              Use DER format for input certificates and private keys.  The no-inder form will disable the option.

              The input files will be assumed to be in DER or RAW format.  Unlike options that in PEM input would allow multiple input data (e.g. multiple certificates), when reading in DER format a single
              data structure is read.

       --inraw
              This is an alias for the --inder option.

       --print-raw, --no-print-raw
              Print the received DANE data in raw format.  The no-print-raw form will disable the option.

              This option will print the received DANE data.

       --quiet
              Suppress several informational messages.

              In that case on the exit code can be used as an indication of verification success

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       -v [{v|c|n --version [{v|c|n}]}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

EXAMPLES
       DANE TLSA RR generation

       To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a certificate (or public key) that was issued localy and may or may not be signed by a CA use the following command.
           $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem

       To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a CA signed certificate, which will be marked as such use the following command.
           $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem   --no-domain

       The former is useful to add in your DNS entry even if your certificate is signed by a CA. That way even users who do not trust your CA will be able to verify your certificate using DANE.

       In order to create a record for the CA signer of your certificate use the following.
           $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem   --ca --no-domain

       To read a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
           $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443

       To verify a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
           $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443 --load-certificate chain.pem

EXIT STATUS
       One of the following exit values will be returned:

       0  (EXIT_SUCCESS)
              Successful program execution.

       1  (EXIT_FAILURE)
              The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

       70  (EX_SOFTWARE)
              libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
