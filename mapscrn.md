NAME
       mapscrn - load screen output mapping table

SYNOPSIS
       mapscrn [-V] [-v] [-o map.orig] mapfile

DESCRIPTION
       The  mapscrn  command  is obsolete - its function is now built-in into
       setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is  still  available
       as a separate command.

       The  mapscrn command loads a user defined output character mapping ta‐
       ble into the console driver. The console driver may be later put  into
       use  user-defined  mapping  table  mode by outputting a special escape
       sequence to the console device.  This sequence is <esc>(K for  the  G0
       character  set  and  <esc>)K  for  the  G1 character set.  When the -o
       option is given, the old map is saved in map.orig.

USE
       There are two kinds of mapping  tables:  direct-to-font  tables,  that
       give  a  font  position  for each user byte value, and user-to-unicode
       tables that give a unicode value for each user byte. The corresponding
       glyph is now found using the unicode index of the font.  The command
              mapscrn trivial
       sets  up  a  one-to-one direct-to-font table where user bytes directly
       address the font. This is useful for fonts that are in the same  order
       as the character set one uses.  A command like
              mapscrn 8859-2
       sets  up  a  user-to-unicode table that assumes that the user uses ISO
       8859-2.

INPUT FORMAT
       The mapscrn command can read the map in either of two formats:
       1. 256 or 512 bytes binary data
       2. two-column text file
       Format (1) is a direct image of the translation table.  The  256-bytes
       tables  are  direct-to-font,  the 512-bytes tables are user-to-unicode
       tables.  Format (2) is used to fill the table as  follows:  cell  with
       offset  mentioned  in  the  first column is filled with the value men‐
       tioned in the second column.  When values larger than  255  occur,  or
       values  are written using the U+xxxx notation, the table is assumed to
       be a user-to-unicode table, otherwise it is a direct-to-font table.

       Values in the file may be specified in one of several formats:
       1. Decimal: String of decimal digits not starting with '0'
       2. Octal: String of octal digits beginning with '0'.
       3. Hexadecimal: String of hexadecimal digits preceded by "0x".
       4. Unicode: String of four hexadecimal digits preceded by "U+".
       5. Character: Single character enclosed in  single  quotes.  (And  the
       binary  value is used.)  Note that blank, comma, tab character and '#'
       cannot be specified with this format.
       6. UTF-8 Character:  Single  (possibly  multi-byte)  UTF-8  character,
       enclosed in single quotes.

       Note  that  control  characters  (with codes < 32) cannot be re-mapped
       with mapscrn because they have special meaning for the driver.

OTHER OPTIONS
       -V     Prints version number and exits.

       -v     Be verbose.

FILES
       /usr/share/consoletrans is the default directory for screen mappings.
