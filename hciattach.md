NAME
       hciattach - attach serial devices via UART HCI to BlueZ stack

SYNOPSIS
       hciattach [-b] [-n] [-p] [-t timeout] [-s speed] [-l] [-r] tty type|id speed flow bdaddr

DESCRIPTION
       Hciattach is used to attach a serial UART to the Bluetooth stack as HCI transport interface.

OPTIONS
       -b     Send break.

       -n     Don't detach from controlling terminal.

       -p     Print the PID when detaching.

       -t timeout
              Specify an initialization timeout.  (Default is 5 seconds.)

       -s speed
              Specify an initial speed instead of the hardware default.

       -l     List all available configurations.

       -r     Set the HCI device into raw mode (the kernel and bluetoothd will ignore it).

       tty    This specifies the serial device to attach. A leading /dev can be omitted. Examples: /dev/ttyS1 ttyS2

       type|id
              The type or id of the Bluetooth device that is to be attached, i.e. vendor or other device specific identifier. Currently supported types are

       speed  The  speed  specifies  the UART speed to use. Baudrates higher than 115.200bps require vendor specific initializations that are not implemented for all types of devices. In general the
              following speeds are supported:

              9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 921600

              Supported vendor devices are automatically initialised to their respective best settings.

       flow   If the keyword flow is appended to the list of options then hardware flow control is forced on the serial link ( CRTSCTS ). All above mentioned device types have flow set  by  default.
              To force no flow control use noflow instead.

       sleep  Enables  hardware  specific  power management feature. If sleep is appended to the list of options then this feature is enabled. To disable this feature use nosleep instead.  All above
              mentioned device types have nosleep set by default.

              Note: This option will only be valid for hardware which support hardware specific power management enable option from host.

       bdaddr The bdaddr specifies the Bluetooth Address to use.  Some devices (like the STLC2500) do not store the Bluetooth address in hardware memory.  Instead it must be uploaded during the ini‚Äê
              tialization process.  If this argument is specified, then the address will be used to initialize the device.  Otherwise, a default address will be used.
