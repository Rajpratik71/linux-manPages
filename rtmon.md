RTMON(8)                   System Manager's Manual                   RTMON(8)

NAME
       rtmon - listens to and monitors RTnetlink

SYNOPSIS
       rtmon [ options ] file FILE [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the rtmon command.

       rtmon listens on netlink socket and monitors routing table changes.

       rtmon can be started before the first network configuration command is
       issued.  For example if you insert:

       rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log

       in a startup script, you will be able to view the full history  later.
       Certainly,  it is possible to start rtmon at any time. It prepends the
       history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment of starting.

OPTIONS
       rtmon supports the following options:

       -Version
              Print version and exit.

       help   Show summary of options.

       file FILE [ all | LISTofOBJECTS ]
              Log output to FILE. LISTofOBJECTS is the list of  object  types
              that  we  want  to  monitor.  It may contain 'link', 'address',
              'route'  and  'all'.  'link'  specifies  the  network   device,
              'address'  the  protocol  (IP  or  IPv6)  address  on a device,
              'route' the routing table entry and 'all' does  what  the  name
              says.

       -family [ inet | inet6 | link | help ]
              Specify  protocol  family.  'inet'  is  IPv4,  'inet6' is IPv6,
              'link' means that no networking protocol is involved and 'help'
              prints usage information.

       -4     Use IPv4. Shortcut for -family inet.

       -6     Use IPv6. Shortcut for -family inet6.

       -0     Use a special family identifier meaning that no networking pro‐
              tocol is involved. Shortcut for -family link.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       # rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log
              Log to file /var/log/rtmon.log, then run:

       # ip monitor file /var/log/rtmon.log
              to display logged output from file.
