NAME
       pnmsplit - split a multi-image PNM file into multiple single-image files


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       Starting with Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005), pnmsplit is obsolete.  Use pamsplit(1)
        instead.

       pamsplit is backward compatible with pnmsplit.  You can use the pamsplit manual for pnmsplit as long as you ignore features that were added after Netpbm 10.30.
