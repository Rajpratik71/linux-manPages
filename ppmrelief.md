NAME
       ppmrelief - run a Laplacian relief filter on a PPM image


SYNOPSIS
       ppmrelief

       [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       ppmrelief reads a PPM image as input, does a Laplacian relief filter, and writes a PPM image as output.

       The Laplacian relief filter is described in 'Beyond Photography' by Holzmann, equation 3.19.  It's a sort of edge-detection.
