HISTORY
       A  program of this name was written in 1993 by Ingo Wilken and was part of Netpbm until Release 10.34 (April 2006).  At that time, it was replaced in Netpbm by the current program, which was written
       by Bryan Henderson.  The function of the newer program is identical to that of the older one; the reason for the replacement is that the newer one is easier to maintain.
