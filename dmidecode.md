NAME
       dmidecode - DMI table decoder

SYNOPSIS
       dmidecode [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       dmidecode  is  a tool for dumping a computer's DMI (some say SMBIOS) table contents in a human-
       readable format. This table contains a description of the system's hardware components, as well
       as  other useful pieces of information such as serial numbers and BIOS revision. Thanks to this
       table, you can retrieve this information without having  to  probe  for  the  actual  hardware.
       While this is a good point in terms of report speed and safeness, this also makes the presented
       information possibly unreliable.

       The DMI table doesn't only describe what the system is currently made of, it  also  can  report
       the possible evolutions (such as the fastest supported CPU or the maximal amount of memory sup‐
       ported).

       SMBIOS stands for System Management BIOS, while DMI stands for  Desktop  Management  Interface.
       Both standards are tightly related and developed by the DMTF (Desktop Management Task Force).

       As  you  run  it, dmidecode will try to locate the DMI table. It will first try to read the DMI
       table from sysfs, and next try reading directly from memory if sysfs access failed.  If  dmide‐
       code  succeeds  in locating a valid DMI table, it will then parse this table and display a list
       of records like this one:

       Handle 0x0002, DMI type 2, 8 bytes.  Base Board Information
               Manufacturer: Intel
               Product Name: C440GX+
               Version: 727281-001
               Serial Number: INCY92700942

       Each record has:

       • A handle. This is a unique identifier, which allows records to reference each other. For  ex‐
         ample, processor records usually reference cache memory records using their handles.

       • A  type.  The SMBIOS specification defines different types of elements a computer can be made
         of. In this example, the type is 2, which means that the record contains "Base Board Informa‐
         tion".

       • A  size.  Each record has a 4-byte header (2 for the handle, 1 for the type, 1 for the size),
         the rest is used by the record data. This value doesn't take text strings into account (these
         are  placed  at the end of the record), so the actual length of the record may be (and is of‐
         ten) greater than the displayed value.

       • Decoded values. The information presented of course depends on the type of record.  Here,  we
         learn about the board's manufacturer, model, version and serial number.

OPTIONS
       -d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -q, --quiet
              Be less verbose. Unknown, inactive and OEM-specific entries are not displayed. Meta-data
              and handle references are hidden.

       -s, --string KEYWORD
              Only display the value of the DMI string identified by KEYWORD.  KEYWORD must be a  key‐
              word from the following list: bios-vendor, bios-version, bios-release-date, system-manu‐
              facturer, system-product-name, system-version, system-serial-number,  system-uuid,  sys‐
              tem-family,  baseboard-manufacturer,  baseboard-product-name,  baseboard-version,  base‐
              board-serial-number, baseboard-asset-tag, chassis-manufacturer,  chassis-type,  chassis-
              version,  chassis-serial-number, chassis-asset-tag, processor-family, processor-manufac‐
              turer, processor-version, processor-frequency.  Each keyword corresponds to a given  DMI
              type  and  a  given offset within this entry type.  Not all strings may be meaningful or
              even defined on all systems. Some keywords may return more than one result on some  sys‐
              tems  (e.g.  processor-version on a multi-processor system).  If KEYWORD is not provided
              or not valid, a list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode exits with an error.
              This option cannot be used more than once.

              Note:  on  Linux,  most  of these strings can alternatively be read directly from sysfs,
              typically from files under /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id.  Most of these  files  are  even
              readable by regular users.

       -t, --type TYPE
              Only display the entries of type TYPE. TYPE can be either a DMI type number, or a comma-
              separated list of type numbers, or a keyword from  the  following  list:  bios,  system,
              baseboard,  chassis,  processor,  memory, cache, connector, slot. Refer to the DMI TYPES
              section below for details.  If this option is used more than once, the set of  displayed
              entries will be the union of all the given types.  If TYPE is not provided or not valid,
              a list of all valid keywords is printed and dmidecode exits with an error.

       -H, --handle HANDLE
              Only display the entry whose handle matches HANDLE.  HANDLE is a 16-bit integer.

       -u, --dump
              Do not decode the entries, dump their contents as hexadecimal instead.  Note  that  this
              is  still a text output, no binary data will be thrown upon you. The strings attached to
              each entry are displayed as both hexadecimal and ASCII. This option is mainly useful for
              debugging.

           --dump-bin FILE
              Do  not decode the entries, instead dump the DMI data to a file in binary form. The gen‐
              erated file is suitable to pass to --from-dump later.

           --from-dump FILE
              Read the DMI data from a binary file previously generated using --dump-bin.

           --no-sysfs
              Do not attempt to read DMI data from sysfs files. This is mainly useful for debugging.

           --oem-string N
              Only display the value of the OEM string number N. The first OEM string  has  number  1.
              With special value "count", return the number of OEM strings instead.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit

       Options --string, --type, --dump-bin and --oem-string determine the output format and are mutu‐
       ally exclusive.

       Please note in case of dmidecode is run on a system with BIOS that boasts new SMBIOS specifica‐
       tion, which is not supported by the tool yet, it will print out relevant message in addition to
       requested data on the very top of the output. Thus informs the output data is not reliable.

DMI TYPES
       The SMBIOS specification defines the following DMI types:

       Type   Information

       ────────────────────────────────────────────
          0   BIOS
          1   System

          5   Memory Controller
          6   Memory Module
          7   Cache
          8   Port Connector
          9   System Slots
         10   On Board Devices

         23   System Reset
         24   Hardware Security
         25   System Power Controls
         26   Voltage Probe
         27   Cooling Device
         28   Temperature Probe
         29   Electrical Current Probe
         30   Out-of-band Remote Access
         31   Boot Integrity Services
         32   System Boot
         33   64-bit Memory Error
         34   Management Device
         35   Management Device Component
         36   Management Device Threshold Data
         37   Memory Channel
         38   IPMI Device
         39   Power Supply
         40   Additional Information
         41   Onboard Devices Extended Information
         42   Management Controller Host Interface

       Additionally, type 126 is used for disabled entries and type 127  is  an  end-of-table  marker.
       Types  128  to 255 are for OEM-specific data.  dmidecode will display these entries by default,
       but it can only decode them when the vendors have contributed documentation or code for them.

       Keywords can be used instead of type numbers with --type.  Each keyword is equivalent to a list
       of type numbers:

       Keyword     Types
       ──────────────────────────────
       bios        0, 13
       system      1, 12, 15, 23, 32
       baseboard   2, 10, 41
       chassis     3
       processor   4
       memory      5, 6, 16, 17
       cache       7
       connector   8
       slot        9

       Keywords are matched case-insensitively. The following command lines are equivalent:

       • dmidecode --type 0 --type 13

       • dmidecode --type 0,13

       • dmidecode --type bios

       • dmidecode --type BIOS

BINARY DUMP FILE FORMAT
       The  binary dump files generated by --dump-bin and read using --from-dump are formatted as fol‐
       lows:

       • The SMBIOS or DMI entry point is located at offset 0x00.  It is crafted to hard-code the  ta‐
         ble address at offset 0x20.

       • The DMI table is located at offset 0x20.

FILES
       /dev/mem  /sys/firmware/dmi/tables/smbios_entry_point (Linux only) /sys/firmware/dmi/tables/DMI
       (Linux only)

BUGS
       More often than not, information contained in the DMI tables is inaccurate, incomplete or  sim‐
       ply wrong.
