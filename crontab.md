       crontab [[_f_i_l_e]]

       crontab [[−e|−l|−r]]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The _c_r_o_n_t_a_b utility shall create, replace, or edit a user's crontab
       entry; a crontab entry is a list of commands and the times at which
       they shall be executed. The new crontab entry can be input by
       specifying _f_i_l_e or input from standard input if no _f_i_l_e operand is
       specified, or by using an editor, if −−ee is specified.

       Upon execution of a command from a crontab entry, the implementation
       shall supply a default environment, defining at least the following
       environment variables:

       _H_O_M_E      A pathname of the user's home directory.

       _L_O_G_N_A_M_E   The user's login name.

       _P_A_T_H      A string representing a search path guaranteed to find all of
                 the standard utilities.

       _S_H_E_L_L     A pathname of the command interpreter. When _c_r_o_n_t_a_b is
                 invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, the
                 value shall be a pathname for _s_h.

       The values of these variables when _c_r_o_n_t_a_b is invoked as specified by
       this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 shall not affect the default values
       provided when the scheduled command is run.

       If standard output and standard error are not redirected by commands
       executed from the crontab entry, any generated output or errors shall
       be mailed, via an implementation-defined method, to the user.

       Users shall be permitted to use _c_r_o_n_t_a_b if their names appear in the
       file ccrroonn..aallllooww which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file ccrroonn..ddeennyy, which is
       located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be checked to
       determine whether the user shall be denied access to _c_r_o_n_t_a_b.  If
       neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall
       be allowed to submit a job. If only ccrroonn..ddeennyy exists and is empty,
       global usage shall be permitted. The ccrroonn..aallllooww and ccrroonn..ddeennyy files
       shall consist of one user name per line.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The _c_r_o_n_t_a_b utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _1_2_._2, _U_t_i_l_i_t_y _S_y_n_t_a_x _G_u_i_d_e_l_i_n_e_s.

       The following options shall be supported:

       −−ee        Edit a copy of the invoking user's crontab entry, or create
                 an empty entry to edit if the crontab entry does not exist.
                 When editing is complete, the entry shall be installed as the
                 user's crontab entry.

       −−ll        (The letter ell.) List the invoking user's crontab entry.

       −−rr        Remove the invoking user's crontab entry.

OOPPEERRAANNDDSS
       The following operand shall be supported:

       _f_i_l_e      The pathname of a file that contains specifications, in the
                 format defined in the INPUT FILES section, for crontab
                 entries.

SSTTDDIINN
       See the INPUT FILES section.

IINNPPUUTT FFIILLEESS
       In the POSIX locale, the user or application shall ensure that a
       crontab entry is a text file consisting of lines of six fields each.
       The fields shall be separated by <blank> characters. The first five
       fields shall be integer patterns that specify the following:

        1. Minute [0,59]

        2. Hour [0,23]

        3. Day of the month [1,31]

        4. Month of the year [1,12]

        5. Day of the week ([0,6] with 0=Sunday)

       Each of these patterns can be either an <asterisk> (meaning all valid
       values), an element, or a list of elements separated by <comma>
       characters. An element shall be either a number or two numbers
       separated by a <hyphen> (meaning an inclusive range). The specification
       of days can be made by two fields (day of the month and day of the
       week). If month, day of month, and day of week are all <asterisk>
       characters, every day shall be matched. If either the month or day of
       month is specified as an element or list, but the day of week is an
       <asterisk>, the month and day of month fields shall specify the days
       that match. If both month and day of month are specified as an
       <asterisk>, but day of week is an element or list, then only the
       specified days of the week match. Finally, if either the month or day
       of month is specified as an element or list, and the day of week is
       also specified as an element or list, then any day matching either the
       month and day of month, or the day of week, shall be matched.

       The sixth field of a line in a crontab entry is a string that shall be
       executed by _s_h at the specified times. A <percent-sign> character in
       this field shall be translated to a <newline>.  Any character preceded
       by a <backslash> (including the ''%%'') shall cause that character to be
       treated literally. Only the first line (up to a ''%%'' or end-of-line) of
       the command field shall be executed by the command interpreter. The
       other lines shall be made available to the command as standard input.

       Blank lines and those whose first non-<blank> is ''##'' shall be ignored.

       The text files ccrroonn..aallllooww and ccrroonn..ddeennyy, which are located in an
       implementation-defined directory, shall contain zero or more user
       names, one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized or
       denied access to the service underlying the _c_r_o_n_t_a_b utility.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
       _c_r_o_n_t_a_b:

       _E_D_I_T_O_R    Determine the editor to be invoked when the −−ee option is
                 specified. The default editor shall be _v_i.

       _L_A_N_G      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                 variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions
                 volume of POSIX.1‐2008, _S_e_c_t_i_o_n _8_._2, _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_t_i_o_n_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n
                 _V_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s for the precedence of internationalization
                 variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       _L_C___A_L_L    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of
                 all the other internationalization variables.

       _L_C___C_T_Y_P_E  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of
                 bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as
                 opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input
                 files).

       _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S
                 Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format
                 and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard
                 error.

       _N_L_S_P_A_T_H   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing
                 of _L_C___M_E_S_S_A_G_E_S.

AAPPPPLLIICCAATTIIOONN UUSSAAGGEE
       The format of the crontab entry shown here is guaranteed only for the
       POSIX locale. Other cultures may be supported with substantially
       different interfaces, although implementations are encouraged to
       provide comparable levels of functionality.

       The default settings of the _H_O_M_E, _L_O_G_N_A_M_E, _P_A_T_H, and _S_H_E_L_L variables
       that are given to the scheduled job are not affected by the settings of
       those variables when _c_r_o_n_t_a_b is run; as stated, they are defaults. The
       text about ``invoked as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008''
       means that the implementation may provide extensions that allow these
       variables to be affected at runtime, but that the user has to take
       explicit action in order to access the extension, such as give a new
       option flag or modify the format of the crontab entry.

       A typical user error is to type only _c_r_o_n_t_a_b; this causes the system to
       wait for the new crontab entry on standard input. If end-of-file is
       typed (generally <control>‐D), the crontab entry is replaced by an
       empty file. In this case, the user should type the interrupt character,
       which prevents the crontab entry from being replaced.

           would run a command on the first and fifteenth of each month, as
           well as on every Monday. To specify days by only one field, the
           other field should be set to ''**''; for example:


               00 00 ** ** 11

           would run a command only on Mondays.

       All references to a _c_r_o_n daemon and to _c_r_o_n _f_i_l_e_s have been omitted.
       Although historical implementations have used this arrangement, there
       is no reason to limit future implementations.

       This description of _c_r_o_n_t_a_b is designed to support only users with
       normal privileges. The format of the input is based on the System V
       _c_r_o_n_t_a_b; however, there is no requirement here that the actual system
       database used by the _c_r_o_n daemon (or a similar mechanism) use this
       format internally. For example, systems derived from BSD are likely to
       have an additional field appended that indicates the user identity to
       be used when the job is submitted.

       The −−ee option was adopted from the SVID as a user convenience, although
       it does not exist in all historical implementations.
