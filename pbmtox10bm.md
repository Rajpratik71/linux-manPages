NAME
       pbmtox10bm - convert a PBM image to an X11 bitmap


DESCRIPTION
       pbmtox10bm was replaced in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006) by pbmtoxbm(1)

       pbmtoxbm with the -x10 option is backward compatible with pbmtox10bm.  pbmtoxbm also can generate X11 bitmaps.

       You  should  not  make  any new use of pbmtox10bm and if you modify an existing use, you should upgrade to pbmtoxbm.  But note that if you write a program that might have to be used with old Netpbm,
       pbmtox10bm is the only way to do that.
