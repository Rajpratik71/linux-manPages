SETTERM(1)                                                                                    User Commands                                                                                    SETTERM(1)

NAME
       setterm - set terminal attributes

SYNOPSIS
       setterm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       setterm  writes to standard output a character string that will invoke the specified terminal capabilities.  Where possible terminfo is consulted to find the string to use.  Some options however
       (marked "virtual consoles only" below) do not correspond to a terminfo(5) capability.  In this case, if the terminal type is "con" or "linux" the string that invokes the  specified  capabilities
       on the PC Minix virtual console driver is output.  Options that are not implemented by the terminal are ignored.

OPTIONS
       For boolean options (on or off), the default is on.

       Below, an 8-color can be black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.

       A 16-color can be an 8-color, or grey, or bright followed by red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.

       The  various  color  options may be set independently, at least on virtual consoles, though the results of setting multiple modes (for example, --underline and --half-bright) are hardware-depen‐
       dent.

       --appcursorkeys [on|off]  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets Cursor Key Application Mode on or off.  When on, ESC O A, ESC O B, etc.  will be sent for the cursor keys instead of ESC [ A, ESC [ B, etc.  See the vi and Cursor-Keys section of the
              Text-Terminal-HOWTO for how this can cause problems for vi users.

       --append [console_number]
              Like --dump, but appends to the snapshot file instead of overwriting it.  Only works if no --dump options are given.

       --background 8-color|default
              Sets the background text color.

       --blank [0-60|force|poke]  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets  the  interval of inactivity, in minutes, after which the screen will be automatically blanked (using APM if available).  Without an argument, it gets the blank status (returns which
              vt was blanked, or zero for an unblanked vt).

              The force option keeps the screen blank even if a key is pressed.

              The poke option unblanks the screen.

       --bfreq [number]  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the bell frequency in Hertz.  Without an argument, it defaults to 0.

       --blength [0-2000]  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the bell duration in milliseconds.  Without an argument, it defaults to 0.

       --blink [on|off]
              Turns blink mode on or off.  Except on a virtual console, --blink off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       --bold [on|off]
              Turns bold (extra bright) mode on or off.  Except on a virtual console, --bold off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       --clear [all|rest]
              Without an argument or with the argument all, the entire screen is cleared and the cursor is set to the home position, just like clear(1) does.  With the  argument  rest,  the  screen  is
              cleared from the current cursor position to the end.

       --clrtabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...]  (virtual consoles only)
              Clears tab stops from the given horizontal cursor positions, in the range 1-160.  Without arguments, it clears all tab stops.

       --cursor [on|off]
              Turns the terminal's cursor on or off.

       --default
              Sets the terminal's rendering options to the default values.

       --dump [console_number]
              Writes a snapshot of the virtual console with the given number to the file specified with the --file option, overwriting its contents; the default is screen.dump.  Without an argument, it
              dumps the current virtual console.  This overrides --append.

       --file filename
              Sets the snapshot file name for any --dump or --append options on the same command line.  If this option is not present, the default is screen.dump in the current directory.  A path  name
              that exceeds the system maximum will be truncated, see PATH_MAX from linux/limits.h for the value.

       --foreground 8-color|default
              Sets the foreground text color.

       --half-bright [on|off]
              Turns dim (half-brightness) mode on or off.  Except on a virtual console, --half-bright off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       --hbcolor 16-color
              Sets the color for bold characters.

       --initialize
              Displays the terminal initialization string, which typically sets the terminal's rendering options, and other attributes to the default values.

       --inversescreen [on|off]
              Swaps foreground and background colors for the whole screen.

       --linewrap [on|off]
              Makes the terminal continue on a new line when a line is full.

       --msg [on|off]  (virtual consoles only)
              Enables or disables the sending of kernel printk() messages to the console.

       --msglevel 0-8  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the console logging level for kernel printk() messages.  All messages strictly more important than this will be printed, so a logging level of 0 has the same effect as --msg on and a
              logging level of 8 will print all kernel messages.  klogd(8) may be a more convenient interface to the logging of kernel messages.

       --powerdown [0-60]
              Sets the VESA powerdown interval in minutes.  Without an argument, it defaults to 0 (disable powerdown).  If the console is blanked or the monitor is in suspend  mode,  then  the  monitor
              will go into vsync suspend mode or powerdown mode respectively after this period of time has elapsed.

       --powersave off
              Turns off monitor VESA powersaving features.

       --powersave on|vsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA vsync suspend mode.

       --powersave powerdown
              Puts the monitor into VESA powerdown mode.

       --powersave hsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA hsync suspend mode.

       --regtabs [1-160]  (virtual consoles only)
              Clears all tab stops, then sets a regular tab stop pattern, with one tab every specified number of positions.  Without an argument, it defaults to 8.

       --repeat [on|off]  (virtual consoles only)
              Turns keyboard repeat on or off.

       --reset
              Displays the terminal reset string, which typically resets the terminal to its power-on state.

       --reverse [on|off]
              Turns reverse video mode on or off.  Except on a virtual console, --reverse off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       --store  (virtual consoles only)
              Stores the terminal's current rendering options (foreground and background colors) as the values to be used at reset-to-default.

       --tabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...]
              Sets tab stops at the given horizontal cursor positions, in the range 1-160.  Without arguments, it shows the current tab stop settings.

       --term terminal_name
              Overrides the TERM environment variable.

       --ulcolor 16-color  (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the color for underlined characters.

       --underline [on|off]
              Turns underline mode on or off.

       --version
              Displays version information and exits.

       --help Displays a help text and exits.

COMPATIBILITY
       Since version 2.25 setterm has support for long options with two hyphens, for example --help, beside the historical long options with a single hyphen, for example -help.  In scripts it is better
       to use the backward-compatible single hyphen rather than the double hyphen.  Currently there are no plans nor good reasons to discontinue single-hyphen compatibility.
