NAME
       gpg-wks-server - Server for the Web Key Service

SYNOPSIS
       gpg-wks-server [COMMAND] [OPTIONS] [ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg-wks-server is a server for the Web Key Service.  It can handle incoming mails with the --receive command.

       See the EXAMPLES section for procmail and crontab configurations.

       You also need a webserver configured to alias requests to /.well-known/openpgp/ and below to the /var/lib/gnupg/wks/<wkd-domain>/ directory.

COMMANDS
       --receive
              Receive a submission or confirmation.

       --cron Run regular jobs.

       --list-domains
              List configured domains, and checks some file and directory permissions.

       --version
              Show program version and some meta information.

       -h, --help
              Output a short usage information.

       --warranty
              Print warranty information.

       --dump-options
              Dump all available options and commands.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Enable verbose output.

       -q, --quiet
              Be somewhat more quiet.

       --send Send the mail using sendmail.

       -o, --output FILE
              Write the mail to FILE.

       --from ADDR
              Use ADDR as the default sender.

       --header NAME=VALUE
              Add "NAME: VALUE" as header to all mails.

              Can be used to add a header for loop detections, see procmail example.

       --debug
              Set   debugging  flags.  All flags are or-ed and flags may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a comma separated list of flag names.  To get a list of all supported flags the sin‐
              gle word "help" can be used.

       --gpg GPG
              Use the specified command instead of gpg.

DIRECTORIES
       /var/lib/gnupg/wks/
              Contains a subdirectory for each domain to run the server for.  Each subdirectory is supposed to contain what should show up on https://.../.well-known/openpgp/.

              The user running gpg-wks-server needs write access to these subdirectories.

EXAMPLES
   ~/.procmailrc
       Store received emails in ~/Mail/ (create it manually first), uses From: key-submission@example.com and X-WKS-Loop: example.com as loop detection:

           MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
           LOGFILE=$HOME/Mail/from
           LOCKFILE=$HOME/Mail/.lockmail
           VERBOSE=yes

           # filter out FROM_DAEMON mails (bounces, ...) into separate mailbox
           :0
           * ^FROM_DAEMON
           from-daemon/

           # archive (copy!) all "normal" mails
           :0 c
           archive/

           # if not in a loop: handle mails with gpg-wks-server
           :0 w
           * !^From: key-submission@example.com
           * !^X-WKS-Loop: example.com
           |gpg-wks-server -v --receive \
               --header X-WKS-Loop=example.com \
               --from key-submission@example.com --send

           # if handling failed: store in separate mailbox
           :0 e
           cruft/

   ~/.forward
       In case procmail is not used automatically the following ~/.forward file might be useful:

           "|exec /usr/bin/procmail || exit 75"

       The double quotes are supposed to be included in the file!

   crontab
       You should run the --cron command once a day.  Edit the crontab with

           crontab -e

       and append the following line:

           42 3 * * * gpg-wks-server --cron
