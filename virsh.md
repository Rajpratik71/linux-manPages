NAME
       virsh - management user interface

SYNOPSIS
       virsh [OPTION]... [COMMAND_STRING]

       virsh [OPTION]... COMMAND [ARG]...

DESCRIPTION
       The virsh program is the main interface for managing virsh guest domains. The program can be
       used to create, pause, and shutdown domains. It can also be used to list current domains.
       Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent versions of
       Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available under the GNU Lesser General Public
       License. Virtualization of the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple
       instances of Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic
       resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at providing a long term stable C
       API.  It currently supports Xen, QEMU, KVM, LXC, OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware ESX.

       The basic structure of most virsh usage is:

         virsh [OPTION]... <command> <domain> [ARG]...

       Where command is one of the commands listed below; domain is the numeric domain id, or the
       domain name, or the domain UUID; and ARGS are command specific options.  There are a few
       exceptions to this rule in the cases where the command in question acts on all domains, the
       entire machine, or directly on the xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions will be clear for each of
       those commands.  Note: it is permissible to give numeric names to domains, however, doing so
       will result in a domain that can only be identified by domain id. In other words, if a numeric
       value is supplied it will be interpreted as a domain id, not as a name. Any command starting
       with # is treated as a comment and silently ignored, all other unrecognized commands are
       diagnosed.

       The virsh program can be used either to run one COMMAND by giving the command and its arguments
       on the shell command line, or a COMMAND_STRING which is a single shell argument consisting of
       multiple COMMAND actions and their arguments joined with whitespace and separated by semicolons
       or newlines between commands, where unquoted backslash-newline pairs are elided.  Within
       COMMAND_STRING, virsh understands the same single, double, and backslash escapes as the shell,
       although you must add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument,
       and any word starting with unquoted # begins a comment that ends at newline.  If no command is
       given in the command line, virsh will then start a minimal interpreter waiting for your
       commands, and the quit command will then exit the program.

       The virsh program understands the following OPTIONS.

       -c, --connect URI
           Connect to the specified URI, as if by the connect command, instead of the default
           connection.

       -d, --debug LEVEL
           Enable debug messages at integer LEVEL and above.  LEVEL can range from 0 to 4 (default).
           See the documentation of VIRSH_DEBUG environment variable below for the description of each
           LEVEL.

       -e, --escape string
           Set alternative escape sequence for console command. By default, telnet's ^] is used.
           Allowed characters when using hat notation are: alphabetic character, @, [, ], \, ^, _.

       -h, --help
           Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the help command were given instead.

       -k, --keepalive-interval INTERVAL
           Set an INTERVAL (in seconds) for sending keepalive messages to check whether connection to
           the server is still alive.  Setting the interval to 0 disables client keepalive mechanism.

       -K, --keepalive-count COUNT
           Set a number of times keepalive message can be sent without getting an answer from the
           server without marking the connection dead.  There is no effect to this setting in case the
           INTERVAL is set to 0.

       -l, --log FILE
           Output logging details to FILE.

       -q, --quiet
           Avoid extra informational messages.

       -r, --readonly
           Make the initial connection read-only, as if by the --readonly option of the connect
           command.

       -t, --timing
           Output elapsed time information for each command.

       -v, --version[=short]
           Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library virsh is coming
           from

       -V, --version=long
           Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library virsh is coming
           from and which options and driver are compiled in.

NOTES
       Most virsh operations rely upon the libvirt library being able to connect to an already running
       libvirtd service.  This can usually be done using the command service libvirtd start.

       Most virsh commands require root privileges to run due to the communications channels used to
       talk to the hypervisor.  Running as non root will return an error.

       Most virsh commands act synchronously, except maybe shutdown, setvcpus and setmem. In those
       cases the fact that the virsh program returned, may not mean the action is complete and you
       must poll periodically to detect that the guest completed the operation.

       virsh strives for backward compatibility.  Although the help command only lists the preferred
       usage of a command, if an older version of virsh supported an alternate spelling of a command
       or option (such as --tunnelled instead of --tunneled), then scripts using that older spelling
       will continue to work.

       Several virsh commands take an optionally scaled integer; if no scale is provided, then the
       default is listed in the command (for historical reasons, some commands default to bytes, while
       other commands default to kibibytes).  The following case-insensitive suffixes can be used to
       select a specific scale:
         b, byte  byte      1
         KB       kilobyte  1,000
         k, KiB   kibibyte  1,024
         MB       megabyte  1,000,000
         M, MiB   mebibyte  1,048,576
         GB       gigabyte  1,000,000,000
         G, GiB   gibibyte  1,073,741,824
         TB       terabyte  1,000,000,000,000
         T, TiB   tebibyte  1,099,511,627,776
         PB       petabyte  1,000,000,000,000,000
         P, PiB   pebibyte  1,125,899,906,842,624
         EB       exabyte   1,000,000,000,000,000,000
         E, EiB   exbibyte  1,152,921,504,606,846,976

GENERIC COMMANDS
       The following commands are generic i.e. not specific to a domain.

       help [command-or-group]
           This lists each of the virsh commands.  When used without options, all commands are listed,
           one per line, grouped into related categories, displaying the keyword for each group.

           To display only commands for a specific group, give the keyword for that group as an
           option.  For example:

            virsh # help host

             Host and Hypervisor (help keyword 'host'):
                capabilities                   capabilities
                cpu-models                     show the CPU models for an architecture
                connect                        (re)connect to hypervisor
                freecell                       NUMA free memory
                hostname                       print the hypervisor hostname
                qemu-attach                    Attach to existing QEMU process
                qemu-monitor-command           QEMU Monitor Command
                qemu-agent-command             QEMU Guest Agent Command
                sysinfo                        print the hypervisor sysinfo
                uri                            print the hypervisor canonical URI

           To display detailed information for a specific command, give its name as the option
           instead.  For example:

            virsh # help list
              NAME
                list - list domains

              SYNOPSIS
                list [--inactive] [--all]

              DESCRIPTION
                Returns list of domains.

              OPTIONS
                --inactive       list inactive domains
                --all            list inactive & active domains

       quit, exit
           quit this interactive terminal

       version [--daemon]
           Will print out the major version info about what this built from.  If --daemon is specified
           then the version of the libvirt daemon is included in the output.

               Example

                $ virsh version
                Compiled against library: libvirt 1.2.3
                Using library: libvirt 1.2.3
                Using API: QEMU 1.2.3
                Running hypervisor: QEMU 2.0.50

                $ virsh version --daemon
                Compiled against library: libvirt 1.2.3
                Using library: libvirt 1.2.3
                Using API: QEMU 1.2.3
                Running hypervisor: QEMU 2.0.50
                Running against daemon: 1.2.6

       cd [directory]
           Will change current directory to directory.  The default directory for the cd command is
           the home directory or, if there is no HOME variable in the environment, the root directory.

           This command is only available in interactive mode.

       pwd Will print the current directory.

       connect [URI] [--readonly]
           (Re)-Connect to the hypervisor. When the shell is first started, this is automatically run
           with the URI parameter requested by the "-c" option on the command line. The URI parameter
           specifies how to connect to the hypervisor. The documentation page at
           <https://libvirt.org/uri.html> list the values supported, but the most common are:

           xen:///system
               this is used to connect to the local Xen hypervisor

           qemu:///system
               connect locally as root to the daemon supervising QEMU and KVM domains

           qemu:///session
               connect locally as a normal user to his own set of QEMU and KVM domains

           lxc:///system
               connect to a local linux container

           To find the currently used URI, check the uri command documented below.

           For remote access see the documentation page at <https://libvirt.org/uri.html> on how to
           make URIs.  The --readonly option allows for read-only connection

       uri Prints the hypervisor canonical URI, can be useful in shell mode.

       hostname
           Print the hypervisor hostname.

       sysinfo
           Print the XML representation of the hypervisor sysinfo, if available.

       nodeinfo
           Returns basic information about the node, like number and type of CPU, and size of the
           physical memory. The output corresponds to virNodeInfo structure. Specifically, the "CPU
           socket(s)" field means number of CPU sockets per NUMA cell. The information libvirt
           displays is dependent upon what each architecture may provide.

       nodecpumap [--pretty]
           Displays the node's total number of CPUs, the number of online CPUs and the list of online
           CPUs.

           With --pretty the online CPUs are printed as a range instead of a list.

       nodecpustats [cpu] [--percent]
           Returns cpu stats of the node.  If cpu is specified, this will print the specified cpu
           statistics only.  If --percent is specified, this will print the percentage of each kind of
           cpu statistics during 1 second.

       nodememstats [cell]
           Returns memory stats of the node.  If cell is specified, this will print the specified cell
           statistics only.

       nodesuspend [target] [duration]
           Puts the node (host machine) into a system-wide sleep state and schedule the node's Real-
           Time-Clock interrupt to resume the node after the time duration specified by duration is
           out.  target specifies the state to which the host will be suspended to, it can be "mem"
           (suspend to RAM), "disk" (suspend to disk), or "hybrid" (suspend to both RAM and disk).
           duration specifies the time duration in seconds for which the host has to be suspended, it
           should be at least 60 seconds.

       node-memory-tune [shm-pages-to-scan] [shm-sleep-millisecs] [shm-merge-across-nodes]
           Allows you to display or set the node memory parameters.  shm-pages-to-scan can be used to
           set the number of pages to scan before the shared memory service goes to sleep; shm-sleep-
           millisecs can be used to set the number of millisecs the shared memory service should sleep
           before next scan; shm-merge-across-nodes specifies if pages from different numa nodes can
           be merged. When set to 0, only pages which physically reside in the memory area of same
           NUMA node can be merged. When set to 1, pages from all nodes can be merged. Default to 1.

           Note: Currently the "shared memory service" only means KSM (Kernel Samepage Merging).

       capabilities
           Print an XML document describing the capabilities of the hypervisor we are currently
           connected to. This includes a section on the host capabilities in terms of CPU and
           features, and a set of description for each kind of guest which can be virtualized. For a
           more complete description see:
             <https://libvirt.org/formatcaps.html> The XML also show the NUMA topology information if
           available.

       domcapabilities [virttype] [emulatorbin] [arch] [machine]
           Print an XML document describing the domain capabilities for the hypervisor we are
           connected to using information either sourced from an existing domain or taken from the
           virsh capabilities output. This may be useful if you intend to create a new domain and are
           curious if for instance it could make use of VFIO by creating a domain for the hypervisor
           with a specific emulator and architecture.

           Each hypervisor will have different requirements regarding which options are required and
           which are optional. A hypervisor can support providing a default value for any of the
           options.

           The virttype option specifies the virtualization type used. The value to be used is either
           from the 'type' attribute of the <domain/> top level element from the domain XML or the
           'type' attribute found within each <guest/> element from the virsh capabilities output.
           The emulatorbin option specifies the path to the emulator. The value to be used is either
           the <emulator> element in the domain XML or the virsh capabilities output. The arch option
           specifies the architecture to be used for the domain. The value to be used is either the
           "arch" attribute from the domain's XML <os/> element and <type/> subelement or the "name"
           attribute of an <arch/> element from the virsh capabililites output. The machine specifies
           the machine type for the emulator. The value to be used is either the "machine" attribute
           from the domain's XML <os/> element and <type/> subelement or one from a list of machines
           from the virsh capabilities output for a specific architecture and domain type.

           For the qemu hypervisor, a virttype of either 'qemu' or 'kvm' must be supplied along with
           either the emulatorbin or arch in order to generate output for the default machine.
           Supplying a machine value will generate output for the specific machine.

       pool-capabilities Print an XML document describing the storage pool capabilities for the
       connected storage driver. This may be useful if you intend to create a new storage pool and
       need to know the available pool types and supported storage pool source and target volume
       formats as well as the required source elements to create the pool.
       inject-nmi domain
           Inject NMI to the guest.

       list [--inactive | --all] [--managed-save] [--title] { [--table] | --name | --uuid }
       [--persistent] [--transient] [--with-managed-save] [--without-managed-save] [--autostart]
       [--no-autostart] [--with-snapshot] [--without-snapshot] [--state-running] [--state-paused]
       [--state-shutoff] [--state-other]
           Prints information about existing domains.  If no options are specified it prints out
           information about running domains.

           An example format for the list is as follows:

           virsh list
             Id    Name                           State
            ----------------------------------------------------
             0     Domain-0                       running
             2     fedora                         paused

           Name is the name of the domain.  ID the domain numeric id.  State is the run state (see
           below).

           STATES

           The State field lists what state each domain is currently in. A domain can be in one of the
           following possible states:

           running
               The domain is currently running on a CPU

           idle
               The domain is idle, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused because the domain
               is waiting on IO (a traditional wait state) or has gone to sleep because there was
               nothing else for it to do.

           paused
               The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator running virsh
               suspend.  When in a paused state the domain will still consume allocated resources like
               memory, but will not be eligible for scheduling by the hypervisor.

           in shutdown
               The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system has been
               notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations gracefully.

           shut off
               The domain is not running.  Usually this indicates the domain has been shut down
               completely, or has not been started.

           crashed
               The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually this state can only
               occur if the domain has been configured not to restart on crash.

           pmsuspended
               The domain has been suspended by guest power management, e.g. entered into s3 state.

           Normally only active domains are listed. To list inactive domains specify --inactive or
           --all to list both active and inactive domains.

           To further filter the list of domains you may specify one or more of filtering flags
           supported by the list command. These flags are grouped by function.  Specifying one or more
           flags from a group enables the filter group. Note that some combinations of flags may yield
           no results. Supported filtering flags and groups:

           Persistence
               Flag --persistent is used to include persistent domains in the returned list. To
               include transient domains specify --transient.

           Existence of managed save image
               To list domains having a managed save image specify flag --with-managed-save. For
               domains that don't have a managed save image specify --without-managed-save.

           Domain state
               The following filter flags select a domain by its state: --state-running for running
               domains, --state-paused  for paused domains, --state-shutoff for turned off domains and
               --state-other for all other states as a fallback.

           Autostarting domains
               To list autostarting domains use the flag --autostart. To list domains with this
               feature disabled use --no-autostart.

           Snapshot existence
               Domains that have snapshot images can be listed using flag --with-snapshot, domains
               without a snapshot --without-snapshot.

           When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API calls with an
           inherent race, where a domain might not be listed or might appear more than once if it
           changed state between calls while the list was being collected.  Newer servers do not have
           this problem.

           If --managed-save is specified, then domains that have managed save state (only possible if
           they are in the shut off state, so you need to specify --inactive or --all to actually list
           them) will instead show as saved in the listing. This flag is usable only with the default
           --table output.  Note that this flag does not filter the list of domains.

           If --name is specified, domain names are printed instead of the table formatted one per
           line. If --uuid is specified domain's UUID's are printed instead of names. Flag --table
           specifies that the legacy table-formatted output should be used. This is the default.

           If both --name and --uuid are specified, domain UUID's and names are printed side by side
           without any header. Flag --table specifies that the legacy table-formatted output should be
           used. This is the default if neither --name nor --uuid are specified. Option --table is
           mutually exclusive with options --uuid and --name.

           If --title is specified, then the short domain description (title) is printed in an extra
           column. This flag is usable only with the default --table output.

           Example:

           virsh list --title
             Id    Name        State      Title
            -------------------------------------------
             0     Domain-0    running    Mailserver 1
             2     fedora      paused

       freecell [{ [--cellno] cellno | --all }]
           Prints the available amount of memory on the machine or within a NUMA cell.  The freecell
           command can provide one of three different displays of available memory on the machine
           depending on the options specified.  With no options, it displays the total free memory on
           the machine.  With the --all option, it displays the free memory in each cell and the total
           free memory on the machine.  Finally, with a numeric argument or with --cellno plus a cell
           number it will display the free memory for the specified cell only.

       freepages [{ [--cellno] cellno [--pagesize] pagesize | --all }]
           Prints the available amount of pages within a NUMA cell. cellno refers to the NUMA cell
           you're interested in. pagesize is a scaled integer (see NOTES above).  Alternatively, if
           --all is used, info on each possible combination of NUMA cell and page size is printed out.

       allocpages [--pagesize] pagesize [--pagecount] pagecount [[--cellno] cellno] [--add] [--all]
           Change the size of pages pool of pagesize on the host. If --add is specified, then
           pagecount pages are added into the pool. However, if --add wasn't specified, then the
           pagecount is taken as the new absolute size of the pool (this may be used to free some
           pages and size the pool down). The cellno modifier can be used to narrow the modification
           down to a single host NUMA cell. On the other end of spectrum lies --all which executes the
           modification on all NUMA cells.

       cpu-baseline FILE [--features] [--migratable]
           Compute baseline CPU which will be supported by all host CPUs given in <file>.  (See
           hypervisor-cpu-baseline command to get a CPU which can be provided by a specific
           hypervisor.) The list of host CPUs is built by extracting all <cpu> elements from the
           <file>. Thus, the <file> can contain either a set of <cpu> elements separated by new lines
           or even a set of complete <capabilities> elements printed by capabilities command.  If
           --features is specified, then the resulting XML description will explicitly include all
           features that make up the CPU, without this option features that are part of the CPU model
           will not be listed in the XML description.   If --migratable is specified, features that
           block migration will not be included in the resulting CPU.

       cpu-compare FILE [--error]
           Compare CPU definition from XML <file> with host CPU. (See hypervisor-cpu-compare command
           for comparing the CPU definition with the CPU which a specific hypervisor is able to
           provide on the host.) The XML <file> may contain either host or guest CPU definition. The
           host CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its contents as printed by capabilities
           command. The guest CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its contents from domain XML
           definition or the CPU definition created from the host CPU model found in domain
           capabilities XML (printed by domcapabilities command). In addition to the <cpu> element
           itself, this command accepts full domain XML, capabilities XML, or domain capabilities XML
           containing the CPU definition. For more information on guest CPU definition see:
           <https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU>. If --error is specified, the command
           will return an error when the given CPU is incompatible with host CPU and a message
           providing more details about the incompatibility will be printed out.

       cpu-models arch
           Print the list of CPU models known by libvirt for the specified architecture.  Whether a
           specific hypervisor is able to create a domain which uses any of the printed CPU models is
           a separate question which can be answered by looking at the domain capabilities XML
           returned by domcapabilities command.  Moreover, for some architectures libvirt does not
           know any CPU models and the usable CPU models are only limited by the hypervisor. This
           command will print that all CPU models are accepted for these architectures and the actual
           list of supported CPU models can be checked in the domain capabilities XML.

       echo [--shell] [--xml] [err...] [arg...]
           Echo back each arg, separated by space.  If --shell is specified, then the output will be
           single-quoted where needed, so that it is suitable for reuse in a shell context.  If --xml
           is specified, then the output will be escaped for use in XML.  If --err is specified,
           prefix "error: " and output to stderr instead of stdout.

       hypervisor-cpu-compare FILE [virttype] [emulator] [arch] [machine] [--error]
           Compare CPU definition from XML <file> with the CPU the hypervisor is able to provide on
           the host. (This is different from cpu-compare which compares the CPU definition with the
           host CPU without considering any specific hypervisor and its abilities.)

           The XML FILE may contain either a host or guest CPU definition. The host CPU definition is
           the <cpu> element and its contents as printed by the capabilities command. The guest CPU
           definition is the <cpu> element and its contents from the domain XML definition or the CPU
           definition created from the host CPU model found in the domain capabilities XML (printed by
           the domcapabilities command). In addition to the <cpu> element itself, this command accepts
           full domain XML, capabilities XML, or domain capabilities XML containing the CPU
           definition. For more information on guest CPU definition see:
           <https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU>.

           The virttype option specifies the virtualization type (usable in the 'type' attribute of
           the <domain> top level element from the domain XML). emulator specifies the path to the
           emulator, arch specifies the CPU architecture, and machine specifies the machine type. If
           --error is specified, the command will return an error when the given CPU is incompatible
           with the host CPU and a message providing more details about the incompatibility will be
           printed out.

       hypervisor-cpu-baseline FILE [virttype] [emulator] [arch] [machine] [--features] [--migratable]
           Compute a baseline CPU which will be compatible with all CPUs defined in an XML file and
           with the CPU the hypervisor is able to provide on the host. (This is different from cpu-
           baseline which does not consider any hypervisor abilities when computing the baseline CPU.)

           The XML FILE may contain either host or guest CPU definitions describing the host CPU
           model. The host CPU definition is the <cpu> element and its contents as printed by
           capabilities command. The guest CPU definition may be created from the host CPU model found
           in domain capabilities XML (printed by domcapabilities command). In addition to the <cpu>
           elements, this command accepts full capabilities XMLs, or domain capabilities XMLs
           containing the CPU definitions. For best results, use only the CPU definitions from domain
           capabilities.

           When FILE contains only a single CPU definition, the command will print the same CPU with
           restrictions imposed by the capabilities of the hypervisor.  Specifically, running th virsh
           hypervisor-cpu-baseline command with no additional options on the result of virsh
           domcapabilities will transform the host CPU model from domain capabilities XML to a form
           directly usable in domain XML.

           The virttype option specifies the virtualization type (usable in the 'type' attribute of
           the <domain> top level element from the domain XML). emulator specifies the path to the
           emulator, arch specifies the CPU architecture, and machine specifies the machine type. If
           --features is specified, then the resulting XML description will explicitly include all
           features that make up the CPU, without this option features that are part of the CPU model
           will not be listed in the XML description. If --migratable is specified, features that
           block migration will not be included in the resulting CPU.

DOMAIN COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate domains directly, as stated previously most commands take
       domain as the first parameter. The domain can be specified as a short integer, a name or a full
       UUID.

       autostart [--disable] domain
           Configure a domain to be automatically started at boot.

           The option --disable disables autostarting.

       console domain [devname] [--safe] [--force]
           Connect the virtual serial console for the guest. The optional devname parameter refers to
           the device alias of an alternate console, serial or parallel device configured for the
           guest.  If omitted, the primary console will be opened.

           If the flag --safe is specified, the connection is only attempted if the driver supports
           safe console handling. This flag specifies that the server has to ensure exclusive access
           to console devices. Optionally the --force flag may be specified, requesting to disconnect
           any existing sessions, such as in a case of a broken connection.

       create FILE [--console] [--paused] [--autodestroy] [--pass-fds N,M,...] [--validate]
           Create a domain from an XML <file>. Optionally, --validate option can be passed to validate
           the format of the input XML file against an internal RNG schema (identical to using
           virt-xml-validate(1) tool). Domains created using this command are going to be either
           transient (temporary ones that will vanish once destroyed) or existing persistent domains
           that will run with one-time use configuration, leaving the persistent XML untouched (this
           can come handy during an automated testing of various configurations all based on the
           original XML).  See the Example section for usage demonstration.

           The domain will be paused if the --paused option is used and supported by the driver;
           otherwise it will be running. If --console is requested, attach to the console after
           creation.  If --autodestroy is requested, then the guest will be automatically destroyed
           when virsh closes its connection to libvirt, or otherwise exits.

           If --pass-fds is specified, the argument is a comma separated list of open file descriptors
           which should be pass on into the guest. The file descriptors will be re-numbered in the
           guest, starting from 3. This is only supported with container based virtualization.

           Example

            1) prepare a template from an existing domain (skip directly to 3a if writing
               one from scratch)

            # virsh dumpxml <domain> > domain.xml

            2) edit the template using an editor of your choice and:
               a) DO CHANGE! <name> and <uuid> (<uuid> can also be removed), or
               b) DON'T CHANGE! either <name> or <uuid>

            # $EDITOR domain.xml

            3) create a domain from domain.xml, depending on whether following 2a or 2b
               respectively:
               a) the domain is going to be transient
               b) an existing persistent domain will run with a modified one-time
                  configuration

            # virsh create domain.xml

       define FILE [--validate]
           Define a domain from an XML <file>. Optionally, the format of the input XML file can be
           validated against an internal RNG schema with --validate (identical to using
           virt-xml-validate(1) tool). The domain definition is registered but not started.  If domain
           is already running, the changes will take effect on the next boot.

       desc domain [[--live] [--config] | [--current]] [--title] [--edit] [--new-desc New description
       or title message]
           Show or modify description and title of a domain. These values are user fields that allow
           storing arbitrary textual data to allow easy identification of domains. Title should be
           short, although it's not enforced.  (See also metadata that works with XML based domain
           metadata.)

           Flags --live or --config select whether this command works on live or persistent
           definitions of the domain. If both --live and --config are specified, the --config option
           takes precedence on getting the current description and both live configuration and config
           are updated while setting the description. --current is exclusive and implied if none of
           these was specified.

           Flag --edit specifies that an editor with the contents of current description or title
           should be opened and the contents saved back afterwards.

           Flag --title selects operation on the title field instead of description.

           If neither of --edit and --new-desc are specified the note or description is displayed
           instead of being modified.

       destroy domain [--graceful]
           Immediately terminate the domain domain.  This doesn't give the domain OS any chance to
           react, and it's the equivalent of ripping the power cord out on a physical machine.  In
           most cases you will want to use the shutdown command instead.  However, this does not
           delete any storage volumes used by the guest, and if the domain is persistent, it can be
           restarted later.

           If domain is transient, then the metadata of any snapshots will be lost once the guest
           stops running, but the snapshot contents still exist, and a new domain with the same name
           and UUID can restore the snapshot metadata with snapshot-create.

           If --graceful is specified, don't resort to extreme measures (e.g. SIGKILL) when the guest
           doesn't stop after a reasonable timeout; return an error instead.

       domblkstat domain [block-device] [--human]
           Get device block stats for a running domain.  A block-device corresponds to a unique target
           name (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk
           devices attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names). On a lxc or qemu
           domain, omitting the block-device yields device block stats summarily for the entire
           domain.

           Use --human for a more human readable output.

           Availability of these fields depends on hypervisor. Unsupported fields are missing from the
           output. Other fields may appear if communicating with a newer version of libvirtd.

           Explanation of fields (fields appear in the following order):
             rd_req            - count of read operations
             rd_bytes          - count of read bytes
             wr_req            - count of write operations
             wr_bytes          - count of written bytes
             errs              - error count
             flush_operations  - count of flush operations
             rd_total_times    - total time read operations took (ns)
             wr_total_times    - total time write operations took (ns)
             flush_total_times - total time flush operations took (ns)
               <-- other fields provided by hypervisor -->

       domifaddr domain [interface] [--full] [--source lease|agent|arp]
           Get a list of interfaces of a running domain along with their IP and MAC addresses, or
           limited output just for one interface if interface is specified. Note that interface can be
           driver dependent, it can be the name within guest OS or the name you would see in domain
           XML. Moreover, the whole command may require a guest agent to be configured for the queried
           domain under some hypervisors, notably QEMU.

           If --full is specified, the interface name and MAC address is always displayed when the
           interface has multiple IP addresses or aliases; otherwise, only the interface name and MAC
           address is displayed for the first name and MAC address with "-" for the others using the
           same name and MAC address.

           The --source argument specifies what data source to use for the addresses, currently
           'lease' to read DHCP leases, 'agent' to query the guest OS via an agent, or 'arp' to get IP
           from host's arp tables.  If unspecified, 'lease' is the default.

       domifstat domain interface-device
           Get network interface stats for a running domain. The network interface stats are only
           available for interfaces that have a physical source interface. This does not include, for
           example, a 'user' interface type since it is a virtual LAN with NAT to the outside world.
           interface-device can be the interface target by name or MAC address.

       domif-setlink domain interface-device state [--config]
           Modify link state of the domain's virtual interface. Possible values for state are "up" and
           "down". If --config is specified, only the persistent configuration of the domain is
           modified, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config.  interface-device
           can be the interface's target name or the MAC address.

       domif-getlink domain interface-device [--config]
           Query link state of the domain's virtual interface. If --config is specified, query the
           persistent configuration, for compatibility purposes, --persistent is alias of --config.

           interface-device can be the interface's target name or the MAC address.

       domiftune domain interface-device [[--config] [--live] | [--current]] [--inbound
       average,peak,burst,floor] [--outbound average,peak,burst]
           Set or query the domain's network interface's bandwidth parameters.  interface-device can
           be the interface's target name (<target dev='name'/>), or the MAC address.

           If no --inbound or --outbound is specified, this command will query and show the bandwidth
           settings. Otherwise, it will set the inbound or outbound bandwidth.
           average,peak,burst,floor is the same as in command attach-interface.  Values for average,
           peak and floor are expressed in kilobytes per second, while burst is expressed in kilobytes
           in a single burst at peak speed as described in the Network XML documentation at
           <https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html#elementQoS>.

           To clear inbound or outbound settings, use --inbound or --outbound respectfully with
           average value of zero.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
           specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

       dommemstat domain [--period seconds] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Get memory stats for a running domain.

           Availability of these fields depends on hypervisor. Unsupported fields are missing from the
           output. Other fields may appear if communicating with a newer version of libvirtd.

           Explanation of fields:
             swap_in           - The amount of data read from swap space (in KiB)
             swap_out          - The amount of memory written out to swap space (in KiB)
             major_fault       - The number of page faults where disk IO was required
             minor_fault       - The number of other page faults
             unused            - The amount of memory left unused by the system (in KiB)
             available         - The amount of usable memory as seen by the domain (in KiB)
             actual            - Current balloon value (in KiB)
             rss               - Resident Set Size of the running domain's process (in KiB)
             usable            - The amount of memory which can be reclaimed by balloon without
           causing host swapping (in KiB)
             last-update       - Timestamp of the last update of statistics (in seconds)
             disk_caches       - The amount of memory that can be reclaimed without additional I/O,
           typically disk caches (in KiB)
             hugetlb_pgalloc   - The number of successful huge page allocations initiated from within
           the domain
             hugetlb_pgfail    - The number of failed huge page allocations initiated from within the
           domain

           For QEMU/KVM with a memory balloon, setting the optional --period to a value larger than 0
           in seconds will allow the balloon driver to return additional statistics which will be
           displayed by subsequent dommemstat commands. Setting the --period to 0 will stop the
           balloon driver collection, but does not clear the statistics in the balloon driver.
           Requires at least QEMU/KVM 1.5 to be running on the host.

           The --live, --config, and --current flags are only valid when using the --period option in
           order to set the collection period for the balloon driver. If --live is specified, only the
           running guest collection period is affected. If --config is specified, affect the next boot
           of a persistent guest. If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.

           Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
           specified, behavior is different depending on the guest state.

       domblkerror domain
           Show errors on block devices.  This command usually comes handy when domstate command says
           that a domain was paused due to I/O error.  The domblkerror command lists all block devices
           in error state and the error seen on each of them.

       domblkinfo domain [block-device --all] [--human]
           Get block device size info for a domain.  A block-device corresponds to a unique target
           name (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk
           devices attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names). If --human is
           set, the output will have a human readable output.  If --all is set, the output will be a
           table showing all block devices size info associated with domain.  The --all option takes
           precedence of the others.

       domblklist domain [--inactive] [--details]
           Print a table showing the brief information of all block devices associated with domain. If
           --inactive is specified, query the block devices that will be used on the next boot, rather
           than those currently in use by a running domain. If --details is specified, disk type and
           device value will also be printed. Other contexts that require a block device name (such as
           domblkinfo or snapshot-create for disk snapshots) will accept either target or unique
           source names printed by this command.

       [--list-other]] | [domain ...]
           Get statistics for multiple or all domains. Without any argument this command prints all
           available statistics for all domains.

           The list of domains to gather stats for can be either limited by listing the domains as a
           space separated list, or by specifying one of the filtering flags --list-*. (The approaches
           can't be combined.)

           By default some of the returned fields may be converted to more human friendly values by a
           set of pretty-printers. To suppress this behavior use the --raw flag.

           The individual statistics groups are selectable via specific flags. By default all
           supported statistics groups are returned. Supported statistics groups flags are: --state,
           --cpu-total, --balloon, --vcpu, --interface, --block, --perf, --iothread.

           Note that - depending on the hypervisor type and version or the domain state - not all of
           the following statistics may be returned.

           When selecting the --state group the following fields are returned:

            "state.state" - state of the VM, returned as number from
                            virDomainState enum
            "state.reason" - reason for entering given state, returned
                             as int from virDomain*Reason enum corresponding
                             to given state

           --cpu-total returns:

            "cpu.time" - total cpu time spent for this domain in nanoseconds
            "cpu.user" - user cpu time spent in nanoseconds
            "cpu.system" - system cpu time spent in nanoseconds

            "cpu.cache.monitor.<num>.bank.<index>.id" - host allocated cache id
                                                        for bank <index> in
                                                        cache monitor <num>
            "cpu.cache.monitor.<num>.bank.<index>.bytes" - the number of bytes
                                                           of last level cache
                                                           that the domain is
                                                           using on cache bank

           --block returns information about disks associated with each domain.  Using the --backing
           flag extends this information to cover all resources in the backing chain, rather than the
           default of limiting information to the active layer for each guest disk.  Information
           listed includes:

            "block.count" - number of block devices being listed
            "block.<num>.name" - name of the target of the block
                                 device <num> (the same name for
                                 multiple entries if I<--backing>
                                 is present)
            "block.<num>.backingIndex" - when I<--backing> is present,
                                         matches up with the <backingStore>
                                         index listed in domain XML for
                                         backing files
            "block.<num>.path" - file source of block device <num>, if
                                 it is a local file or block device
            "block.<num>.rd.reqs" - number of read requests
            "block.<num>.rd.bytes" - number of read bytes
            "block.<num>.rd.times" - total time (ns) spent on reads
            "block.<num>.wr.reqs" - number of write requests
            "block.<num>.wr.bytes" - number of written bytes
            "block.<num>.wr.times" - total time (ns) spent on writes
            "block.<num>.fl.reqs" - total flush requests
            "block.<num>.fl.times" - total time (ns) spent on cache flushing
            "block.<num>.errors" - Xen only: the 'oo_req' value
            "block.<num>.allocation" - offset of highest written sector in bytes
            "block.<num>.capacity" - logical size of source file in bytes
            "block.<num>.physical" - physical size of source file in bytes
            "block.<num>.threshold" - threshold (in bytes) for delivering the
                                      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_BLOCK_THRESHOLD event
                                      See domblkthreshold.

           --iothread returns information about IOThreads on the running guest if supported by the
           hypervisor.

           The "poll-max-ns" for each thread is the maximum nanoseconds to allow each polling interval
           to occur. A polling interval is a period of time allowed for a thread to process data
           before being the guest gives up its CPU quantum back to the host. A value set too small
           will not allow the IOThread to run long enough on a CPU to process data. A value set too
           high will consume too much CPU time per IOThread failing to allow other threads running on
           the CPU to get time. The polling interval is not available for statistical purposes.

            "iothread.<id>.poll-max-ns" - maximum polling time in nanoseconds used
                                          by the <id> IOThread. A value of 0 (zero)
                                          indicates polling is disabled.
            "iothread.<id>.poll-grow" - polling time grow value. A value of 0 (zero)
                                        indicates growth is managed by the hypervisor.
            "iothread.<id>.poll-shrink" - polling time shrink value. A value of
                                          0 (zero) indicates shrink is managed by
                                          the hypervisor.

           Selecting a specific statistics groups doesn't guarantee that the daemon supports the
           selected group of stats. Flag --enforce forces the command to fail if the daemon doesn't
           support the selected group.

           When collecting stats libvirtd may wait for some time if there's already another job
           running on given domain for it to finish.  This may cause unnecessary delay in delivering
           stats. Using --nowait suppresses this behaviour. On the other hand some statistics might be
           missing for such domain.

       domiflist domain [--inactive]
           Print a table showing the brief information of all virtual interfaces associated with
           domain. If --inactive is specified, query the virtual interfaces that will be used on the
           next boot, rather than those currently in use by a running domain. Other contexts that
           require a MAC address of virtual interface (such as detach-interface or domif-setlink) will
           accept the MAC address printed by this command.

       blockcommit domain path [bandwidth] [--bytes] [base] [--shallow] [top] [--delete]
       [--keep-relative] [--wait [--async] [--verbose]] [--timeout seconds] [--active] [{--pivot |
       --keep-overlay}]
           Reduce the length of a backing image chain, by committing changes at the top of the chain
           (snapshot or delta files) into backing images.  By default, this command attempts to
           flatten the entire chain.  If base and/or top are specified as files within the backing
           chain, then the operation is constrained to committing just that portion of the chain;
           --shallow can be used instead of base to specify the immediate backing file of the
           resulting top image to be committed.  The files being committed are rendered invalid,
           possibly as soon as the operation starts; using the --delete flag will attempt to remove
           these invalidated files at the successful completion of the commit operation. When the
           --keep-relative flag is used, the backing file paths will be kept relative.

           When top is omitted or specified as the active image, it is also possible to specify
           --active to trigger a two-phase active commit. In the first phase, top is copied into base
           and the job can only be canceled, with top still containing data not yet in base. In the
           second phase, top and base remain identical until a call to blockjob with the --abort flag
           (keeping top as the active image that tracks changes from that point in time) or the
           --pivot flag (making base the new active image and invalidating top).

           By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for the entire disk is
           committed in the background; the progress of the operation can be checked with blockjob.
           However, if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the operation completes
           (or for --active, enters the second phase), or until the operation is canceled because the
           optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is sent (usually with "Ctrl-C").  Using
           --verbose along with --wait will produce periodic status updates.  If job cancellation is
           triggered, --async will return control to the user as fast as possible, otherwise the
           command may continue to block a little while longer until the job is done cleaning up.
           Using --pivot is shorthand for combining --active --wait with an automatic blockjob
           --pivot; and using --keep-overlay is shorthand for combining --active --wait with an
           automatic blockjob --abort.

           path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name
           (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk devices
           attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names).  bandwidth specifies
           copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s, although for qemu, it may be non-zero only for an online
           domain. For further information on the bandwidth argument see the corresponding section for
           the blockjob command.

       blockcopy domain path { dest [format] [--blockdev] | --xml file } [--shallow]
       [--reuse-external] [bandwidth] [--wait [--async] [--verbose]] [{--pivot | --finish}] [--timeout
       seconds] [granularity] [buf-size] [--bytes] [--transient-job]
           Copy a disk backing image chain to a destination.  Either dest as the destination file
           name, or --xml with the name of an XML file containing a top-level <disk> element
           describing the destination, must be present.  Additionally, if dest is given, format should
           be specified to declare the format of the destination (if format is omitted, then libvirt
           will reuse the format of the source, or with --reuse-external will be forced to probe the
           destination format, which could be a potential security hole).  The command supports --raw
           as a boolean flag synonym for --format=raw.  When using dest, the destination is treated as
           a regular file unless --blockdev is used to signal that it is a block device. By default,
           this command flattens the entire chain; but if --shallow is specified, the copy shares the
           backing chain.

           If --reuse-external is specified, then the destination must exist and have sufficient space
           to hold the copy. If --shallow is used in conjunction with --reuse-external then the pre-
           created image must have guest visible contents identical to guest visible contents of the
           backing file of the original image. This may be used to modify the backing file names on
           the destination.

           By default, the copy job runs in the background, and consists of two phases.  Initially,
           the job must copy all data from the source, and during this phase, the job can only be
           canceled to revert back to the source disk, with no guarantees about the destination.
           After this phase completes, both the source and the destination remain mirrored until a
           call to blockjob with the --abort and --pivot flags pivots over to the copy, or a call
           without --pivot leaves the destination as a faithful copy of that point in time.  However,
           if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the mirroring phase begins, or
           cancel the operation if the optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is sent (usually
           with "Ctrl-C").  Using --verbose along with --wait will produce periodic status updates.
           Using --pivot (similar to blockjob --pivot) or --finish (similar to blockjob --abort)
           implies --wait, and will additionally end the job cleanly rather than leaving things in the
           mirroring phase.  If job cancellation is triggered by timeout or by --finish, --async will
           return control to the user as fast as possible, otherwise the command may continue to block
           a little while longer until the job has actually cancelled.

           path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk.  bandwidth specifies copying bandwidth
           limit in MiB/s. Specifying a negative value is interpreted as an unsigned long long value
           that might be essentially unlimited, but more likely would overflow; it is safer to use 0
           for that purpose. For further information on the bandwidth argument see the corresponding
           section for the blockjob command.  Specifying granularity allows fine-tuning of the
           granularity that will be copied when a dirty region is detected; larger values trigger less
           I/O overhead but may end up copying more data overall (the default value is usually
           correct); hypervisors may restrict this to be a power of two or fall within a certain
           range. Specifying buf-size will control how much data can be simultaneously in-flight
           during the copy; larger values use more memory but may allow faster completion (the default
           value is usually correct).

           --transient-job allows specifying that the user does not require the job to be recovered if
           the VM crashes or is turned off before the job completes. This flag removes the restriction
           of copy jobs to transient domains if that restriction is applied by the hypervisor.

       blockpull domain path [bandwidth] [--bytes] [base] [--wait [--verbose] [--timeout seconds]
       [--async]] [--keep-relative]
           Populate a disk from its backing image chain. By default, this command flattens the entire
           chain; but if base is specified, containing the name of one of the backing files in the
           chain, then that file becomes the new backing file and only the intermediate portion of the
           chain is pulled.  Once all requested data from the backing image chain has been pulled, the
           disk no longer depends on that portion of the backing chain.

           By default, this command returns as soon as possible, and data for the entire disk is
           pulled in the background; the progress of the operation can be checked with blockjob.
           However, if --wait is specified, then this command will block until the operation
           completes, or cancel the operation if the optional timeout in seconds elapses or SIGINT is
           sent (usually with "Ctrl-C").  Using --verbose along with --wait will produce periodic
           status updates.  If job cancellation is triggered, --async will return control to the user
           as fast as possible, otherwise the command may continue to block a little while longer
           until the job is done cleaning up.

           Using the --keep-relative flag will keep the backing chain names relative.

           path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name
           (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk devices
           attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names).  bandwidth specifies
           copying bandwidth limit in MiB/s. For further information on the bandwidth argument see the
           corresponding section for the blockjob command.

       blkdeviotune domain device [[--config] [--live] | [--current]] [[total-bytes-sec] | [read-
       bytes-sec] [write-bytes-sec]] [[total-iops-sec] | [read-iops-sec] [write-iops-sec]] [[total-
       bytes-sec-max] | [read-bytes-sec-max] [write-bytes-sec-max]] [[total-iops-sec-max] | [read-
       iops-sec-max] [write-iops-sec-max]] [[total-bytes-sec-max-length] | [read-bytes-sec-max-length]
       [write-bytes-sec-max-length]] [[total-iops-sec-max-length] | [read-iops-sec-max-length] [write-
       iops-sec-max-length]] [size-iops-sec] [group-name]
           Set or query the block disk io parameters for a block device of domain.  device specifies a
           unique target name (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of
           the disk devices attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names).

           If no limit is specified, it will query current I/O limits setting.  Otherwise, alter the
           limits with these flags: --total-bytes-sec specifies total throughput limit as a scaled
           integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.  --read-bytes-sec
           specifies read throughput limit as a scaled integer, the default being bytes per second if
           no suffix is specified.  --write-bytes-sec specifies write throughput limit as a scaled
           integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.  --total-iops-sec
           specifies total I/O operations limit per second.  --read-iops-sec specifies read I/O
           operations limit per second.  --write-iops-sec specifies write I/O operations limit per
           second.  --total-bytes-sec-max specifies maximum total throughput limit as a scaled
           integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified --read-bytes-sec-max
           specifies maximum read throughput limit as a scaled integer, the default being bytes per
           second if no suffix is specified.  --write-bytes-sec-max specifies maximum write throughput
           limit as a scaled integer, the default being bytes per second if no suffix is specified.
           --total-iops-sec-max specifies maximum total I/O operations limit per second.
           --read-iops-sec-max specifies maximum read I/O operations limit per second.
           --write-iops-sec-max specifies maximum write I/O operations limit per second.
           --total-bytes-sec-max-length specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum total
           throughput limit.  --read-bytes-sec-max-length specifies duration in seconds to allow
           maximum read throughput limit.  --write-bytes-sec-max-length specifies duration in seconds
           to allow maximum write throughput limit.  --total-iops-sec-max-length specifies duration in
           seconds to allow maximum total I/O operations limit.  --read-iops-sec-max-length specifies
           duration in seconds to allow maximum read I/O operations limit.
           --write-iops-sec-max-length specifies duration in seconds to allow maximum write I/O
           operations limit.  --size-iops-sec specifies size I/O operations limit per second.
           --group-name specifies group name to share I/O quota between multiple drives.  For a qemu
           domain, if no name is provided, then the default is to have a single group for each device.

           Older versions of virsh only accepted these options with underscore instead of dash, as in
           --total_bytes_sec.

           Bytes and iops values are independent, but setting only one value (such as
           --read-bytes-sec) resets the other two in that category to unlimited.  An explicit 0 also
           clears any limit.  A non-zero value for a given total cannot be mixed with non-zero values
           for read or write.

           It is up to the hypervisor to determine how to handle the length values.  For the qemu
           hypervisor, if an I/O limit value or maximum value is set, then the default value of 1
           second will be displayed. Supplying a 0 will reset the value back to the default.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           When setting the disk io parameters both --live and --config flags may be given, but
           --current is exclusive. For querying only one of --live, --config or --current can be
           specified. If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

       blockjob domain path { [--abort] [--async] [--pivot] | [--info] [--raw] [--bytes] | [bandwidth]
       }
           Manage active block operations.  There are three mutually-exclusive modes: --info,
           bandwidth, and --abort.  --async and --pivot imply abort mode; --raw implies info mode; and
           if no mode was given, --info mode is assumed.

           path specifies fully-qualified path of the disk; it corresponds to a unique target name
           (<target dev='name'/>) or source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk devices
           attached to domain (see also domblklist for listing these names).

           In --abort mode, the active job on the specified disk will be aborted.  If --async is also
           specified, this command will return immediately, rather than waiting for the cancellation
           to complete.  If --pivot is specified, this requests that an active copy or active commit
           job be pivoted over to the new image.

           In --info mode, the active job information on the specified disk will be printed.  By
           default, the output is a single human-readable summary line; this format may change in
           future versions.  Adding --raw lists each field of the struct, in a stable format.  If the
           --bytes flag is set, then the command errors out if the server could not supply bytes/s
           resolution; when omitting the flag, raw output is listed in MiB/s and human-readable output
           automatically selects the best resolution supported by the server.

           bandwidth can be used to set bandwidth limit for the active job in MiB/s.  If --bytes is
           specified then the bandwidth value is interpreted in bytes/s. Specifying a negative value
           is interpreted as an unsigned long value or essentially unlimited. The hypervisor can
           choose whether to reject the value or convert it to the maximum value allowed. Optionally a
           scaled positive number may be used as bandwidth (see NOTES above). Using --bytes with a
           scaled value permits a finer granularity to be selected.  A scaled value used without
           --bytes will be rounded down to MiB/s. Note that the --bytes may be unsupported by the
           hypervisor.

       domblkthreshold domain dev threshold
           Set the threshold value for delivering the block-threshold event. dev specifies the disk
           device target or backing chain element of given device using the 'target[1]' syntax.
           threshold is a scaled value of the offset. If the block device should write beyond that
           offset the event will be delivered.

       blockresize domain path size
           Resize a block device of domain while the domain is running, path specifies the absolute
           path of the block device; it corresponds to a unique target name (<target dev='name'/>) or
           source file (<source file='name'/>) for one of the disk devices attached to domain (see
           also domblklist for listing these names).

           size is a scaled integer (see NOTES above) which defaults to KiB (blocks of 1024 bytes) if
           there is no suffix.  You must use a suffix of "B" to get bytes (note that for historical
           reasons, this differs from vol-resize which defaults to bytes without a suffix).

       domdisplay domain [--include-password] [[--type] type] [--all]
           Output a URI which can be used to connect to the graphical display of the domain via VNC,
           SPICE or RDP.  The particular graphical display type can be selected using the type
           parameter (e.g. "vnc", "spice", "rdp").  If --include-password is specified, the SPICE
           channel password will be included in the URI. If --all is specified, then all show all
           possible graphical displays, for a VM could have more than one graphical displays.

       domfsinfo domain
           Show a list of mounted filesystems within the running domain. The list contains
           mountpoints, names of a mounted device in the guest, filesystem types, and unique target
           names used in the domain XML (<target dev='name'/>).

           Note that this command requires a guest agent configured and running in the domain's guest
           OS.

       domfsfreeze domain [[--mountpoint] mountpoint...]
           Freeze mounted filesystems within a running domain to prepare for consistent snapshots.

           The --mountpoint option takes a parameter mountpoint, which is a mount point path of the
           filesystem to be frozen. This option can occur multiple times. If this is not specified,
           every mounted filesystem is frozen.

           Note: snapshot-create command has a --quiesce option to freeze and thaw the filesystems
           automatically to keep snapshots consistent.  domfsfreeze command is only needed when a user
           wants to utilize the native snapshot features of storage devices not supported by libvirt.

       domfsthaw domain [[--mountpoint] mountpoint...]
           Thaw mounted filesystems within a running domain, which have been frozen by domfsfreeze
           command.

           The --mountpoint option takes a parameter mountpoint, which is a mount point path of the
           filesystem to be thawed. This option can occur multiple times. If this is not specified,
           every mounted filesystem is thawed.

       domfstrim domain [--minimum bytes] [--mountpoint mountPoint]
           Issue a fstrim command on all mounted filesystems within a running domain. It discards
           blocks which are not in use by the filesystem.  If --minimum bytes is specified, it tells
           guest kernel length of contiguous free range. Smaller than this may be ignored (this is a
           hint and the guest may not respect it). By increasing this value, the fstrim operation will
           complete more quickly for filesystems with badly fragmented free space, although not all
           blocks will be discarded.  The default value is zero, meaning "discard every free block".
           Moreover, if a user wants to trim only one mount point, it can be specified via optional
           --mountpoint parameter.

       domhostname domain
           Returns the hostname of a domain, if the hypervisor makes it available.

       dominfo domain
           Returns basic information about the domain.

       domuuid domain-name-or-id
           Convert a domain name or id to domain UUID

       domid domain-name-or-uuid
           Convert a domain name (or UUID) to a domain id

       domjobabort domain
           Abort the currently running domain job.

       domjobinfo domain [--completed]
           Returns information about jobs running on a domain. --completed tells virsh to return
           information about a recently finished job. Statistics of a completed job are automatically
           destroyed once read or when libvirtd is restarted. Note that time information returned for
           completed migrations may be completely irrelevant unless both source and destination hosts
           have synchronized time (i.e., NTP daemon is running on both of them).

       domname domain-id-or-uuid
           Convert a domain Id (or UUID) to domain name

       domrename domain new-name
           Rename a domain. This command changes current domain name to the new name specified in the
           second argument.

           Note: Domain must be inactive and without snapshots.

       domstate domain [--reason]
           Returns state about a domain.  --reason tells virsh to also print reason for the state.

       domcontrol domain
           Returns state of an interface to VMM used to control a domain.  For states other than "ok"
           or "error" the command also prints number of seconds elapsed since the control interface
           entered its current state.

       domtime domain { [--now] [--pretty] [--sync] [--time time] }
           Gets or sets the domain's system time. When run without any arguments (but domain), the
           current domain's system time is printed out. The --pretty modifier can be used to print the
           time in more human readable form.

           When --time time is specified, the domain's time is not gotten but set instead. The --now
           modifier acts like if it was an alias for --time $now, which means it sets the time that is
           currently on the host virsh is running at. In both cases (setting and getting), time is in
           seconds relative to Epoch of 1970-01-01 in UTC.  The --sync modifies the set behavior a
           bit: The time passed is ignored, but the time to set is read from domain's RTC instead.
           Please note, that some hypervisors may require a guest agent to be configured in order to
           get or set the guest time.

       domxml-from-native format config
           Convert the file config in the native guest configuration format named by format to a
           domain XML format. For QEMU/KVM hypervisor, the format argument must be qemu-argv. For Xen
           hypervisor, the format argument may be xen-xm, xen-xl, or xen-sxpr. For LXC hypervisor, the
           format argument must be lxc-tools. For VMware/ESX hypervisor, the format argument must be
           vmware-vmx.  For the Bhyve hypervisor, the format argument must be bhyve-argv.

       domxml-to-native format { [--xml] xml | --domain domain-name-or-id-or-uuid }
           Convert the file xml into domain XML format or convert an existing --domain to the native
           guest configuration format named by format.  The xml and --domain arguments are mutually
           exclusive. For the types of format argument, refer to domxml-from-native.

       dump domain corefilepath [--bypass-cache] { [--live] | [--crash] | [--reset] } [--verbose]
       [--memory-only] [--format string]
           Dumps the core of a domain to a file for analysis.  If --live is specified, the domain
           continues to run until the core dump is complete, rather than pausing up front.  If --crash
           is specified, the domain is halted with a crashed status, rather than merely left in a
           paused state.  If --reset is specified, the domain is reset after successful dump.  Note,
           these three switches are mutually exclusive.  If --bypass-cache is specified, the save will
           avoid the file system cache, although this may slow down the operation.  If --memory-only
           is specified, the file is elf file, and will only include domain's memory and cpu common
           register value. It is very useful if the domain uses host devices directly.  --format
           string is used to specify the format of 'memory-only' dump, and string can be one of them:
           elf, kdump-zlib(kdump-compressed format with zlib-compressed), kdump-lzo(kdump-compressed
           format with lzo-compressed), kdump-snappy(kdump-compressed format with snappy-compressed).

           The progress may be monitored using domjobinfo virsh command and canceled with domjobabort
           command (sent by another virsh instance). Another option is to send SIGINT (usually with
           "Ctrl-C") to the virsh process running dump command. --verbose displays the progress of
           dump.

           NOTE: Some hypervisors may require the user to manually ensure proper permissions on file
           and path specified by argument corefilepath.

           NOTE: Crash dump in a old kvmdump format is being obsolete and cannot be loaded and
           processed by crash utility since its version 6.1.0. A --memory-only option is required in
           order to produce valid ELF file which can be later processed by the crash utility.

       dumpxml domain [--inactive] [--security-info] [--update-cpu] [--migratable]
           Output the domain information as an XML dump to stdout, this format can be used by the
           create command. Additional options affecting the XML dump may be used. --inactive tells
           virsh to dump domain configuration that will be used on next start of the domain as opposed
           to the current domain configuration.  Using --security-info will also include security
           sensitive information in the XML dump. --update-cpu updates domain CPU requirements
           according to host CPU. With --migratable one can request an XML that is suitable for
           migrations, i.e., compatible with older libvirt releases and possibly amended with internal
           run-time options. This option may automatically enable other options (--update-cpu,
           --security-info, ...) as necessary.

       edit domain
           Edit the XML configuration file for a domain, which will affect the next boot of the guest.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh dumpxml --inactive --security-info domain > domain.xml
            vi domain.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh define domain.xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       event {[domain] { event | --all } [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--timestamp] | --list}
           Wait for a class of domain events to occur, and print appropriate details of events as they
           happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by domain.  Using --list as the only
           argument will provide a list of possible event values known by this client, although the
           connection might not allow registering for all these events.  It is also possible to use
           --all instead of event to register for all possible event types at once.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.   With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event.

       iothreadinfo domain [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]
           Display basic domain IOThreads information including the IOThread ID and the CPU Affinity
           for each IOThread.

           If --live is specified, get the IOThreads data from the running guest. If the guest is not
           running, an error is returned.  If --config is specified, get the IOThreads data from the
           next boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified or --live and --config are not
           specified, then get the IOThread data based on the current guest state.

       iothreadpin domain iothread cpulist [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]
           Change the pinning of a domain IOThread to host physical CPUs. In order to retrieve a list
           of all IOThreads, use iothreadinfo. To pin an iothread specify the cpulist desired for the
           IOThread ID as listed in the iothreadinfo output.

           cpulist is a list of physical CPU numbers. Its syntax is a comma separated list and a
           special markup using '-' and '^' (ex. '0-4', '0-3,^2') can also be allowed. The '-' denotes
           the range and the '^' denotes exclusive.  If you want to reset iothreadpin setting, that
           is, to pin an iothread to all physical cpus, simply specify 'r' as a cpulist.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If the guest is not running, an error is
           returned.  If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If
           --current is specified or --live and --config are not specified, affect the current guest
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given if cpulist is present, but --current is
           exclusive.  If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

           Note: The expression is sequentially evaluated, so "0-15,^8" is identical to "9-14,0-7,15"
           but not identical to "^8,0-15".

       iothreadadd domain iothread_id [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Add a new IOThread to the domain using the specified iothread_id.  If the iothread_id
           already exists, the command will fail. The iothread_id must be greater than zero.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If the guest is not running an error is
           returned.  If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If
           --current is specified or --live and --config are not specified, affect the current guest
           state.

       iothreadset domain iothread_id [[--poll-max-ns ns] [--poll-grow factor] [--poll-shrink
       divisor]] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Modifies an existing iothread of the domain using the specified iothread_id. The
           --poll-max-ns provides the maximum polling interval to be allowed for an IOThread in ns. If
           a 0 (zero) is provided, then polling for the IOThread is disabled.  The --poll-grow is the
           factor by which the current polling time will be adjusted in order to reach the maximum
           polling time. If a 0 (zero) is provided, then the default factor will be used. The
           --poll-shrink is the quotient by which the current polling time will be reduced in order to
           get below the maximum polling interval. If a 0 (zero) is provided, then the default
           quotient will be used. The polling values are purely dynamic for a running guest. Saving,
           destroying, stopping, etc. the guest will result in the polling values returning to
           hypervisor defaults at the next start, restore, etc.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If the guest is not running an error is
           returned.  If --current is specified or --live is not specified, then handle as if --live
           was specified.

       iothreaddel domain iothread_id [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Delete an IOThread from the domain using the specified iothread_id.  If an IOThread is
           currently assigned to a disk resource such as via the attach-disk command, then the attempt
           to remove the IOThread will fail.  If the iothread_id does not exist an error will occur.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest. If the guest is not running an error is
           returned.  If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If
           --current is specified or --live and --config are not specified, affect the current guest
           state.

       managedsave domain [--bypass-cache] [{--running | --paused}] [--verbose]
           Save and destroy (stop) a running domain, so it can be restarted from the same state at a
           later time.  When the virsh start command is next run for the domain, it will automatically
           be started from this saved state.  If --bypass-cache is specified, the save will avoid the
           file system cache, although this may slow down the operation.

           The progress may be monitored using domjobinfo virsh command and canceled with domjobabort
           command (sent by another virsh instance). Another option is to send SIGINT (usually with
           "Ctrl-C") to the virsh process running managedsave command. --verbose displays the progress
           of save.

           Normally, starting a managed save will decide between running or paused based on the state
           the domain was in when the save was done; passing either the --running or --paused flag
           will allow overriding which state the start should use.

           The dominfo command can be used to query whether a domain currently has any managed save
           image.

       managedsave-remove domain
           Remove the managedsave state file for a domain, if it exists.  This ensures the domain will
           do a full boot the next time it is started.

       managedsave-define domain xml [{--running | --paused}]
           Update the domain XML that will be used when domain is later started. The xml argument must
           be a file name containing the alternative XML, with changes only in the host-specific
           portions of the domain XML. For example, it can be used to change disk file paths.

           The managed save image records whether the domain should be started to a running or paused
           state.  Normally, this command does not alter the recorded state; passing either the
           --running or --paused flag will allow overriding which state the start should use.

       managedsave-dumpxml domain [--security-info]
           Extract the domain XML that was in effect at the time the saved state file file was created
           with the managedsave command.  Using --security-info will also include security sensitive
           information.

       managedsave-edit domain [{--running | --paused}]
           Edit the XML configuration associated with a saved state file of a domain was created by
           the managedsave command.

           The managed save image records whether the domain should be started to a running or paused
           state.  Normally, this command does not alter the recorded state; passing either the
           --running or --paused flag will allow overriding which state the restore should use.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh managedsave-dumpxml domain-name > state-file.xml
            vi state-file.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh managedsave-define domain-name state-file-xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       maxvcpus [type]
           Provide the maximum number of virtual CPUs supported for a guest VM on this connection.  If
           provided, the type parameter must be a valid type attribute for the <domain> element of
           XML.

       cpu-stats domain [--total] [start] [count]
           Provide cpu statistics information of a domain. The domain should be running. Default it
           shows stats for all CPUs, and a total. Use --total for only the total stats, start for only
           the per-cpu stats of the CPUs from start, count for only count CPUs' stats.

       metadata domain [[--live] [--config] | [--current]] [--edit] [uri] [key] [set] [--remove]
           Show or modify custom XML metadata of a domain. The metadata is a user defined XML that
           allows storing arbitrary XML data in the domain definition.  Multiple separate custom
           metadata pieces can be stored in the domain XML.  The pieces are identified by a private
           XML namespace provided via the uri argument. (See also desc that works with textual
           metadata of a domain.)

           Flags --live or --config select whether this command works on live or persistent
           definitions of the domain. If both --live and --config are specified, the --config option
           takes precedence on getting the current description and both live configuration and config
           are updated while setting the description. --current is exclusive and implied if none of
           these was specified.

           Flag --remove specifies that the metadata element specified by the uri argument should be
           removed rather than updated.

           Flag --edit specifies that an editor with the metadata identified by the uri argument
           should be opened and the contents saved back afterwards.  Otherwise the new contents can be
           provided via the set argument.

           When setting metadata via --edit or set the key argument must be specified and is used to
           prefix the custom elements to bind them to the private namespace.

           If neither of --edit and set are specified the XML metadata corresponding to the uri
           namespace is displayed instead of being modified.

       converge-initial] [auto-converge-increment] [--persistent-xml file] [--tls]
       [--postcopy-bandwidth bandwidth] [--parallel [--parallel-connections connections]]
           Migrate domain to another host.  Add --live for live migration; <--p2p> for peer-2-peer
           migration; --direct for direct migration; or --tunnelled for tunnelled migration.
           --offline migrates domain definition without starting the domain on destination and without
           stopping it on source host.  Offline migration may be used with inactive domains and it
           must be used with --persistent option.  --persistent leaves the domain persistent on
           destination host, --undefinesource undefines the domain on the source host, and --suspend
           leaves the domain paused on the destination host.  --copy-storage-all indicates migration
           with non-shared storage with full disk copy, --copy-storage-inc indicates migration with
           non-shared storage with incremental copy (same base image shared between source and
           destination).  In both cases the disk images have to exist on destination host, the
           --copy-storage-... options only tell libvirt to transfer data from the images on source
           host to the images found at the same place on the destination host. By default only non-
           shared non-readonly images are transferred. Use --migrate-disks to explicitly specify a
           list of disk targets to transfer via the comma separated disk-list argument.
           --change-protection enforces that no incompatible configuration changes will be made to the
           domain while the migration is underway; this flag is implicitly enabled when supported by
           the hypervisor, but can be explicitly used to reject the migration if the hypervisor lacks
           change protection support.  --verbose displays the progress of migration.  --abort-on-error
           cancels the migration if a soft error (for example I/O error) happens during the migration.
           --postcopy enables post-copy logic in migration, but does not actually start post-copy,
           i.e., migration is started in pre-copy mode.  Once migration is running, the user may
           switch to post-copy using the migrate-postcopy command sent from another virsh instance or
           use --postcopy-after-precopy along with --postcopy to let libvirt automatically switch to
           post-copy after the first pass of pre-copy is finished.  The maximum bandwidth consumed
           during the post-copy phase may be limited using --postcopy-bandwidth.

           --auto-converge forces convergence during live migration. The initial guest CPU throttling
           rate can be set with auto-converge-initial. If the initial throttling rate is not enough to
           ensure convergence, the rate is periodically increased by auto-converge-increment.

           --rdma-pin-all can be used with RDMA migration (i.e., when migrateuri starts with rdma://)
           to tell the hypervisor to pin all domain's memory at once before migration starts rather
           than letting it pin memory pages as needed. For QEMU/KVM this requires hard_limit memory
           tuning element (in the domain XML) to be used and set to the maximum memory configured for
           the domain plus any memory consumed by the QEMU process itself. Beware of setting the
           memory limit too high (and thus allowing the domain to lock most of the host's memory).
           Doing so may be dangerous to both the domain and the host itself since the host's kernel
           may run out of memory.

           Note: Individual hypervisors usually do not support all possible types of migration. For
           example, QEMU does not support direct migration.

           In some cases libvirt may refuse to migrate the domain because doing so may lead to
           potential problems such as data corruption, and thus the migration is considered unsafe.
           For QEMU domain, this may happen if the domain uses disks without explicitly setting cache
           mode to "none". Migrating such domains is unsafe unless the disk images are stored on
           coherent clustered filesystem, such as GFS2 or GPFS. If you are sure the migration is safe
           or you just do not care, use --unsafe to force the migration.

           dname is used for renaming the domain to new name during migration, which also usually can
           be omitted.  Likewise, --xml file is usually omitted, but can be used to supply an
           alternative XML file for use on the destination to supply a larger set of changes to any
           host-specific portions of the domain XML, such as accounting for naming differences between
           source and destination in accessing underlying storage.  If --persistent is enabled,
           --persistent-xml file can be used to supply an alternative XML file which will be used as
           the persistent domain definition on the destination host.

           --timeout seconds tells virsh to run a specified action when live migration exceeds that
           many seconds.  It can only be used with --live.  If --timeout-suspend is specified, the
           domain will be suspended after the timeout and the migration will complete offline; this is
           the default if no --timeout-* option is specified on the command line.  When
           --timeout-postcopy is used, virsh will switch migration from pre-copy to post-copy upon
           timeout; migration has to be started with --postcopy option for this to work.

           --compressed activates compression, the compression method is chosen with --comp-methods.
           Supported methods are "mt" and "xbzrle" and can be used in any combination. When no methods
           are specified, a hypervisor default methods will be used. QEMU defaults to "xbzrle".
           Compression methods can be tuned further. --comp-mt-level sets compression level.  Values
           are in range from 0 to 9, where 1 is maximum speed and 9 is maximum compression.
           --comp-mt-threads and --comp-mt-dthreads set the number of compress threads on source and
           the number of decompress threads on target respectively. --comp-xbzrle-cache sets size of
           page cache in bytes.

           Providing --tls causes the migration to use the host configured TLS setup (see
           migrate_tls_x509_cert_dir in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf) in order to perform the migration of
           the domain. Usage requires proper TLS setup for both source and target.

           --parallel option will cause migration data to be sent over multiple parallel connections.
           The number of such connections can be set using --parallel-connections. Parallel
           connections may help with saturating the network link between the source and the target and
           thus speeding up the migration.

           Running migration can be canceled by interrupting virsh (usually using "Ctrl-C") or by
           domjobabort command sent from another virsh instance.

           The desturi and migrateuri parameters can be used to control which destination the
           migration uses.  desturi is important for managed migration, but unused for direct
           migration; migrateuri is required for direct migration, but can usually be automatically
           determined for managed migration.

           Note: The desturi parameter for normal migration and peer2peer migration has different
           semantics:

           •   normal migration: the desturi is an address of the target host as seen from the client
               machine.

           •   peer2peer migration: the desturi is an address of the target host as seen from the
               source machine.

           When migrateuri is not specified, libvirt will automatically determine the hypervisor
           specific URI.  Some hypervisors, including QEMU, have an optional "migration_host"
           configuration parameter (useful when the host has multiple network interfaces).  If this is
           unspecified, libvirt determines a name by looking up the target host's configured hostname.

           There are a few scenarios where specifying migrateuri may help:

           •   The configured hostname is incorrect, or DNS is broken.  If a host has a hostname which
               will not resolve to match one of its public IP addresses, then libvirt will generate an
               incorrect URI.  In this case migrateuri should be explicitly specified, using an IP
               address, or a correct hostname.

           •   The host has multiple network interfaces.  If a host has multiple network interfaces,
               it might be desirable for the migration data stream to be sent over a specific
               interface for either security or performance reasons.  In this case migrateuri should
               be explicitly specified, using an IP address associated with the network to be used.

           •   The firewall restricts what ports are available.  When libvirt generates a migration
               URI, it will pick a port number using hypervisor specific rules.  Some hypervisors only
               require a single port to be open in the firewalls, while others require a whole range
               of port numbers.  In the latter case migrateuri might be specified to choose a specific
               port number outside the default range in order to comply with local firewall policies.

           See <https://libvirt.org/migration.html#uris> for more details on migration URIs.

           Optional graphicsuri overrides connection parameters used for automatically reconnecting a
           graphical clients at the end of migration. If omitted, libvirt will compute the parameters
           based on target host IP address. In case the client does not have a direct access to the
           network virtualization hosts are connected to and needs to connect through a proxy,
           graphicsuri may be used to specify the address the client should connect to. The URI is
           formed as follows:

               protocol://hostname[:port]/[?parameters]

           where protocol is either "spice" or "vnc" and parameters is a list of protocol specific
           parameters separated by '&'. Currently recognized parameters are "tlsPort" and
           "tlsSubject". For example,

               spice://target.host.com:1234/?tlsPort=4567

           Optional listen-address sets the listen address that hypervisor on the destination side
           should bind to for incoming migration. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are accepted as well as
           hostnames (the resolving is done on destination). Some hypervisors do not support this
           feature and will return an error if this parameter is used.

           Optional disks-port sets the port that hypervisor on destination side should bind to for
           incoming disks traffic. Currently it is supported only by qemu.

       migrate-setmaxdowntime domain downtime
           Set maximum tolerable downtime for a domain which is being live-migrated to another host.
           The downtime is a number of milliseconds the guest is allowed to be down at the end of live
           migration.

       migrate-getmaxdowntime domain
           Get the maximum tolerable downtime for a domain which is being live-migrated to another
           host.  This is the number of milliseconds the guest is allowed to be down at the end of
           live migration.

       migrate-compcache domain [--size bytes]
           Sets and/or gets size of the cache (in bytes) used for compressing repeatedly transferred
           memory pages during live migration. When called without size, the command just prints
           current size of the compression cache. When size is specified, the hypervisor is asked to
           change compression cache to size bytes and then the current size is printed (the result may
           differ from the requested size due to rounding done by the hypervisor). The size option is
           supposed to be used while the domain is being live-migrated as a reaction to migration
           progress and increasing number of compression cache misses obtained from domjobinfo.

       migrate-setspeed domain bandwidth [--postcopy]
           Set the maximum migration bandwidth (in MiB/s) for a domain which is being migrated to
           another host. bandwidth is interpreted as an unsigned long long value. Specifying a
           negative value results in an essentially unlimited value being provided to the hypervisor.
           The hypervisor can choose whether to reject the value or convert it to the maximum value
           allowed. If the --postcopy option is specified, the command will set the maximum bandwidth
           allowed during a post-copy migration phase.

       migrate-getspeed domain [--postcopy]
           Get the maximum migration bandwidth (in MiB/s) for a domain. If the --postcopy option is
           specified, the command will get the maximum bandwidth allowed during a post-copy migration
           phase.

       migrate-postcopy domain
           Switch the current migration from pre-copy to post-copy. This is only supported for a
           migration started with --postcopy option.

       numatune domain [--mode mode] [--nodeset nodeset] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Set or get a domain's numa parameters, corresponding to the <numatune> element of domain
           XML.  Without flags, the current settings are displayed.

           mode can be one of `strict', `interleave' and `preferred' or any valid number from the
           virDomainNumatuneMemMode enum in case the daemon supports it.  For a running domain, the
           mode can't be changed, and the nodeset can be changed only if the domain was started with a
           mode of `strict'.

           nodeset is a list of numa nodes used by the host for running the domain.  Its syntax is a
           comma separated list, with '-' for ranges and '^' for excluding a node.

           If --live is specified, set scheduler information of a running guest.  If --config is
           specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect
           the current guest state.

       reboot domain [--mode MODE-LIST]
           Reboot a domain.  This acts just as if the domain had the reboot command run from the
           console.  The command returns as soon as it has executed the reboot action, which may be
           significantly before the domain actually reboots.

           The exact behavior of a domain when it reboots is set by the on_reboot parameter in the
           domain's XML definition.

           By default the hypervisor will try to pick a suitable shutdown method. To specify an
           alternative method, the --mode parameter can specify a comma separated list which includes
           "acpi", "agent", "initctl", "signal" and "paravirt". The order in which drivers will try
           each mode is undefined, and not related to the order specified to virsh.  For strict
           control over ordering, use a single mode at a time and repeat the command.

       reset domain
           Reset a domain immediately without any guest shutdown. reset emulates the power reset
           button on a machine, where all guest hardware sees the RST line set and reinitializes
           internal state.

           Note: Reset without any guest OS shutdown risks data loss.

       restore state-file [--bypass-cache] [--xml file] [{--running | --paused}]
           Restores a domain from a virsh save state file. See save for more info.

           If --bypass-cache is specified, the restore will avoid the file system cache, although this
           may slow down the operation.

           --xml file is usually omitted, but can be used to supply an alternative XML file for use on
           the restored guest with changes only in the host-specific portions of the domain XML.  For
           example, it can be used to account for file naming differences in underlying storage due to
           disk snapshots taken after the guest was saved.

           Normally, restoring a saved image will use the state recorded in the save image to decide
           between running or paused; passing either the --running or --paused flag will allow
           overriding which state the domain should be started in.

           Note: To avoid corrupting file system contents within the domain, you should not reuse the
           saved state file for a second restore unless you have also reverted all storage volumes
           back to the same contents as when the state file was created.

       save domain state-file [--bypass-cache] [--xml file] [{--running | --paused}] [--verbose]
           Saves a running domain (RAM, but not disk state) to a state file so that it can be restored
           later.  Once saved, the domain will no longer be running on the system, thus the memory
           allocated for the domain will be free for other domains to use.  virsh restore restores
           from this state file.  If --bypass-cache is specified, the save will avoid the file system
           cache, although this may slow down the operation.

           The progress may be monitored using domjobinfo virsh command and canceled with domjobabort
           command (sent by another virsh instance). Another option is to send SIGINT (usually with
           "Ctrl-C") to the virsh process running save command. --verbose displays the progress of
           save.

           This is roughly equivalent to doing a hibernate on a running computer, with all the same
           limitations.  Open network connections may be severed upon restore, as TCP timeouts may
           have expired.

           --xml file is usually omitted, but can be used to supply an alternative XML file for use on
           the restored guest with changes only in the host-specific portions of the domain XML.  For
           example, it can be used to account for file naming differences that are planned to be made
           via disk snapshots of underlying storage after the guest is saved.

           Normally, restoring a saved image will decide between running or paused based on the state
           the domain was in when the save was done; passing either the --running or --paused flag
           will allow overriding which state the restore should use.

           Domain saved state files assume that disk images will be unchanged between the creation and
           restore point.  For a more complete system restore point, where the disk state is saved
           alongside the memory state, see the snapshot family of commands.

       save-image-define file xml [{--running | --paused}]
           Update the domain XML that will be used when file is later used in the restore command.
           The xml argument must be a file name containing the alternative XML, with changes only in
           the host-specific portions of the domain XML.  For example, it can be used to account for
           file naming differences resulting from creating disk snapshots of underlying storage after
           the guest was saved.

           The save image records whether the domain should be restored to a running or paused state.
           Normally, this command does not alter the recorded state; passing either the --running or
           --paused flag will allow overriding which state the restore should use.

       save-image-dumpxml file [--security-info]
           Extract the domain XML that was in effect at the time the saved state file file was created
           with the save command.  Using --security-info will also include security sensitive
           information.

       save-image-edit file [{--running | --paused}]
           Edit the XML configuration associated with a saved state file file created by the save
           command.

           The save image records whether the domain should be restored to a running or paused state.
           Normally, this command does not alter the recorded state; passing either the --running or
           --paused flag will allow overriding which state the restore should use.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh save-image-dumpxml state-file > state-file.xml
            vi state-file.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh save-image-define state-file state-file-xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       schedinfo domain [[--config] [--live] | [--current]] [[--set] parameter=value]...
       schedinfo [--weight number] [--cap number] domain
           Allows you to show (and set) the domain scheduler parameters. The parameters available for
           each hypervisor are:

           LXC (posix scheduler) : cpu_shares, vcpu_period, vcpu_quota

           QEMU/KVM (posix scheduler): cpu_shares, vcpu_period, vcpu_quota, emulator_period,
           emulator_quota, iothread_quota, iothread_period

           Xen (credit scheduler): weight, cap

           ESX (allocation scheduler): reservation, limit, shares

           If --live is specified, set scheduler information of a running guest.  If --config is
           specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect
           the current guest state.

           Note: The cpu_shares parameter has a valid value range of 0-262144; Negative values are
           wrapped to positive, and larger values are capped at the maximum.  Therefore, -1 is a
           useful shorthand for 262144. On the Linux kernel, the values 0 and 1 are automatically
           converted to a minimal value of 2.

           Note: The weight and cap parameters are defined only for the XEN_CREDIT scheduler.

           Note: The vcpu_period, emulator_period, and iothread_period parameters have a valid value
           range of 1000-1000000 or 0, and the vcpu_quota, emulator_quota, and iothread_quota
           parameters have a valid value range of 1000-18446744073709551 or less than 0. The value 0
           for either parameter is the same as not specifying that parameter.

       screenshot domain [imagefilepath] [--screen screenID]
           Takes a screenshot of a current domain console and stores it into a file.  Optionally, if
           the hypervisor supports more displays for a domain, screenID allows specifying which screen
           will be captured. It is the sequential number of screen. In case of multiple graphics
           cards, heads are enumerated before devices, e.g. having two graphics cards, both with four
           heads, screen ID 5 addresses the second head on the second card.

       send-key domain [--codeset codeset] [--holdtime holdtime] keycode...
           Parse the keycode sequence as keystrokes to send to domain.  Each keycode can either be a
           numeric value or a symbolic name from the corresponding codeset.  If --holdtime is given,
           each keystroke will be held for that many milliseconds.  The default codeset is linux, but
           use of the --codeset option allows other codesets to be chosen.

           If multiple keycodes are specified, they are all sent simultaneously to the guest, and they
           may be received in random order. If you need distinct keypresses, you must use multiple
           send-key invocations.

       setmem domain size [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Change the memory allocation for a guest domain.  If --live is specified, perform a memory
           balloon of a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent
           guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.  Both --live and
           --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior
           is different depending on hypervisor.

           size is a scaled integer (see NOTES above); it defaults to kibibytes (blocks of 1024 bytes)
           unless you provide a suffix (and the older option name --kilobytes is available as a
           deprecated synonym) .  Libvirt rounds up to the nearest kibibyte.  Some hypervisors require
           a larger granularity than KiB, and requests that are not an even multiple will be rounded
           up.  For example, vSphere/ESX rounds the parameter up to mebibytes (1024 kibibytes).

           For Xen, you can only adjust the memory of a running domain if the domain is
           paravirtualized or running the PV balloon driver.

           For LXC, the value being set is the cgroups value for limit_in_bytes or the maximum amount
           of user memory (including file cache). When viewing memory inside the container, this is
           the /proc/meminfo "MemTotal" value. When viewing the value from the host, use the virsh
           memtune command. In order to view the current memory in use and the maximum value allowed
           to set memory, use the virsh dominfo command.

       set-lifecycle-action domain type action [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Set the lifecycle action for specified lifecycle type.  The valid types are "poweroff",
           "reboot" and "crash", and for each of them valid action is one of "destroy", "restart",
           "rename-restart", "preserve".  For type "crash", additional actions "coredump-destroy" and
           "coredump-restart" are supported.

       set-user-password domain user password [--encrypted]
           Set the password for the user account in the guest domain.

           If --encrypted is specified, the password is assumed to be already encrypted by the method
           required by the guest OS.

           For QEMU/KVM, this requires the guest agent to be configured and running.

       setmaxmem domain size [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Change the maximum memory allocation limit for a guest domain.  If --live is specified,
           affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent
           guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.  Both --live and
           --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior
           is different depending on hypervisor.

           Some hypervisors such as QEMU/KVM don't support live changes (especially increasing) of the
           maximum memory limit.  Even persistent configuration changes might not be performed with
           some hypervisors/configuration (e.g. on NUMA enabled domains on QEMU).  For complex
           configuration changes use command edit instead).

           size is a scaled integer (see NOTES above); it defaults to kibibytes (blocks of 1024 bytes)
           unless you provide a suffix (and the older option name --kilobytes is available as a
           deprecated synonym) .  Libvirt rounds up to the nearest kibibyte.  Some hypervisors require
           a larger granularity than KiB, and requests that are not an even multiple will be rounded
           up.  For example, vSphere/ESX rounds the parameter up to mebibytes (1024 kibibytes).

       memtune domain [--hard-limit size] [--soft-limit size] [--swap-hard-limit size]
       [--min-guarantee size] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Allows you to display or set the domain memory parameters. Without flags, the current
           settings are displayed; with a flag, the appropriate limit is adjusted if supported by the
           hypervisor.  LXC and QEMU/KVM support --hard-limit, --soft-limit, and --swap-hard-limit.
           --min-guarantee is supported only by ESX hypervisor.  Each of these limits are scaled
           integers (see NOTES above), with a default of kibibytes (blocks of 1024 bytes) if no suffix
           is present. Libvirt rounds up to the nearest kibibyte.  Some hypervisors require a larger
           granularity than KiB, and requests that are not an even multiple will be rounded up.  For
           example, vSphere/ESX rounds the parameter up to mebibytes (1024 kibibytes).

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
           specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

           For QEMU/KVM, the parameters are applied to the QEMU process as a whole.  Thus, when
           counting them, one needs to add up guest RAM, guest video RAM, and some memory overhead of
           QEMU itself.  The last piece is hard to determine so one needs guess and try.

           For LXC, the displayed hard_limit value is the current memory setting from the XML or the
           results from a virsh setmem command.

           --hard-limit
               The maximum memory the guest can use.

           --soft-limit
               The memory limit to enforce during memory contention.

           --swap-hard-limit
               The maximum memory plus swap the guest can use.  This has to be more than hard-limit
               value provided.

           --min-guarantee
               The guaranteed minimum memory allocation for the guest.

           Specifying -1 as a value for these limits is interpreted as unlimited.

       perf domain [--enable eventSpec] [--disable eventSpec] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]]
           Get the current perf events setting or enable/disable specific perf events for a guest
           domain.

           Perf is a performance analyzing tool in Linux, and it can instrument CPU performance
           counters, tracepoints, kprobes, and uprobes (dynamic tracing). Perf supports a list of
           measurable events, and can measure events coming from different sources. For instance, some
           event are pure kernel counters, in this case they are called software events, including
           context-switches, minor-faults, etc.. Now dozens of events from different sources can be
           supported by perf.

           Currently only QEMU/KVM supports this command. The --enable and --disable option combined
           with eventSpec can be used to enable or disable specific performance event. eventSpec is a
           string list of one or more events separated by commas. Valid event names are as follows:

           Valid perf event names

           Note: The statistics can be retrieved using the domstats command using the --perf flag.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
           specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

       [--current]]
           Display or set the blkio parameters. QEMU/KVM supports --weight.  --weight is in range
           [100, 1000]. After kernel 2.6.39, the value could be in the range [10, 1000].

           device-weights is a single string listing one or more device/weight pairs, in the format of
           /path/to/device,weight,/path/to/device,weight.  Each weight is in the range [100, 1000],
           [10, 1000] after kernel 2.6.39, or the value 0 to remove that device from per-device
           listings.  Only the devices listed in the string are modified; any existing per-device
           weights for other devices remain unchanged.

           device-read-iops-sec is a single string listing one or more device/read_iops_sec pairs, int
           the format of /path/to/device,read_iops_sec,/path/to/device,read_iops_sec.  Each
           read_iops_sec is a number which type is unsigned int, value 0 to remove that device from
           per-device listing.  Only the devices listed in the string are modified; any existing per-
           device read_iops_sec for other devices remain unchanged.

           device-write-iops-sec is a single string listing one or more device/write_iops_sec pairs,
           int the format of /path/to/device,write_iops_sec,/path/to/device,write_iops_sec.  Each
           write_iops_sec is a number which type is unsigned int, value 0 to remove that device from
           per-device listing.  Only the devices listed in the string are modified; any existing per-
           device write_iops_sec for other devices remain unchanged.

           device-read-bytes-sec is a single string listing one or more device/read_bytes_sec pairs,
           int the format of /path/to/device,read_bytes_sec,/path/to/device,read_bytes_sec.  Each
           read_bytes_sec is a number which type is unsigned long long, value 0 to remove that device
           from per-device listing.  Only the devices listed in the string are modified; any existing
           per-device read_bytes_sec for other devices remain unchanged.

           device-write-bytes-sec is a single string listing one or more device/write_bytes_sec pairs,
           int the format of /path/to/device,write_bytes_sec,/path/to/device,write_bytes_sec.  Each
           write_bytes_sec is a number which type is unsigned long long, value 0 to remove that device
           from per-device listing.  Only the devices listed in the string are modified; any existing
           per-device write_bytes_sec for other devices remain unchanged.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. If no flag is
           specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

       setvcpus domain count [--maximum] [[--config] [--live] | [--current]] [--guest]
       [--hotpluggable]
           Change the number of virtual CPUs active in a guest domain.  By default, this command works
           on active guest domains.  To change the settings for an inactive guest domain, use the
           --config flag.

           The count value may be limited by host, hypervisor, or a limit coming from the original
           description of the guest domain. For Xen, you can only adjust the virtual CPUs of a running
           domain if the domain is paravirtualized.

           If the --config flag is specified, the change is made to the stored XML configuration for
           the guest domain, and will only take effect when the guest domain is next started.

           If --live is specified, the guest domain must be active, and the change takes place
           immediately.  Both the --config and --live flags may be specified together if supported by
           the hypervisor.  If this command is run before the guest has finished booting, the guest
           may fail to process the change.

           If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.

           When no flags are given, the --live flag is assumed and the guest domain must be active.
           In this situation it is up to the hypervisor whether the --config flag is also assumed, and
           therefore whether the XML configuration is adjusted to make the change persistent.

           If --guest is specified, then the count of cpus is modified in the guest instead of the
           hypervisor. This flag is usable only for live domains and may require guest agent to be
           configured in the guest.

           To allow adding vcpus to persistent definitions that can be later hotunplugged after the
           domain is booted it is necessary to specify the --hotpluggable flag. Vcpus added to live
           domains supporting vcpu unplug are automatically marked as hotpluggable.

           The --maximum flag controls the maximum number of virtual cpus that can be hot-plugged the
           next time the domain is booted.  As such, it must only be used with the --config flag, and
           not with the --live or the --current flag. Note that it may not be possible to change the
           maximum vcpu count if the processor topology is specified for the guest.

       setvcpu domain vcpulist [--enable] | [--disable] [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]
           Change state of individual vCPUs using hot(un)plug mechanism.

           See vcpupin for information on format of vcpulist. Hypervisor drivers may require that
           vcpulist contains exactly vCPUs belonging to one hotpluggable entity. This is usually just
           a single vCPU but certain architectures such as ppc64 require a full core to be specified
           at once.

           Note that hypervisors may refuse to disable certain vcpus such as vcpu 0 or others.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state. This is the default. Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is
           exclusive.

       shutdown domain [--mode MODE-LIST]
           Gracefully shuts down a domain.  This coordinates with the domain OS to perform graceful
           shutdown, so there is no guarantee that it will succeed, and may take a variable length of
           time depending on what services must be shutdown in the domain.

           The exact behavior of a domain when it shuts down is set by the on_poweroff parameter in
           the domain's XML definition.

           If domain is transient, then the metadata of any snapshots will be lost once the guest
           stops running, but the snapshot contents still exist, and a new domain with the same name
           and UUID can restore the snapshot metadata with snapshot-create.

           By default the hypervisor will try to pick a suitable shutdown method. To specify an
           alternative method, the --mode parameter can specify a comma separated list which includes
           "acpi", "agent", "initctl", "signal" and "paravirt". The order in which drivers will try
           each mode is undefined, and not related to the order specified to virsh.  For strict
           control over ordering, use a single mode at a time and repeat the command.

       start domain-name-or-uuid [--console] [--paused] [--autodestroy] [--bypass-cache]
       [--force-boot] [--pass-fds N,M,...]
           Start a (previously defined) inactive domain, either from the last managedsave state, or
           via a fresh boot if no managedsave state is present.  The domain will be paused if the
           --paused option is used and supported by the driver; otherwise it will be running.  If
           --console is requested, attach to the console after creation.  If --autodestroy is
           requested, then the guest will be automatically destroyed when virsh closes its connection
           to libvirt, or otherwise exits.  If --bypass-cache is specified, and managedsave state
           exists, the restore will avoid the file system cache, although this may slow down the
           operation.  If --force-boot is specified, then any managedsave state is discarded and a
           fresh boot occurs.

           If --pass-fds is specified, the argument is a comma separated list of open file descriptors
           which should be pass on into the guest. The file descriptors will be re-numbered in the
           guest, starting from 3. This is only supported with container based virtualization.

       suspend domain
           Suspend a running domain. It is kept in memory but won't be scheduled anymore.

       resume domain
           Moves a domain out of the suspended state.  This will allow a previously suspended domain
           to now be eligible for scheduling by the underlying hypervisor.

       dompmsuspend domain target [--duration]
           Suspend a running domain into one of these states (possible target values):
               mem equivalent of S3 ACPI state
               disk equivalent of S4 ACPI state
               hybrid RAM is saved to disk but not powered off

           The --duration argument specifies number of seconds before the domain is woken up after it
           was suspended (see also dompmwakeup). Default is 0 for unlimited suspend time. (This
           feature isn't currently supported by any hypervisor driver and 0 should be used.).

           Note that this command requires a guest agent configured and running in the domain's guest
           OS.

           Beware that at least for QEMU, the domain's process will be terminated when target disk is
           used and a new process will be launched when libvirt is asked to wake up the domain. As a
           result of this, any runtime changes, such as device hotplug or memory settings, are lost
           unless such changes were made with --config flag.

       dompmwakeup domain
           Wakeup a domain from pmsuspended state (either suspended by dompmsuspend or from the guest
           itself). Injects a wakeup into the guest that is in pmsuspended state, rather than waiting
           for the previously requested duration (if any) to elapse. This operation doesn't not
           necessarily fail if the domain is running.

       ttyconsole domain
           Output the device used for the TTY console of the domain. If the information is not
           available the processes will provide an exit code of 1.

       undefine domain [--managed-save] [--snapshots-metadata] [--nvram] [--keep-nvram] [ {--storage
       volumes | --remove-all-storage [--delete-snapshots]} --wipe-storage]
           Undefine a domain. If the domain is running, this converts it to a transient domain,
           without stopping it. If the domain is inactive, the domain configuration is removed.

           The --managed-save flag guarantees that any managed save image (see the managedsave
           command) is also cleaned up.  Without the flag, attempts to undefine a domain with a
           managed save image will fail.

           The --snapshots-metadata flag guarantees that any snapshots (see the snapshot-list command)
           are also cleaned up when undefining an inactive domain.  Without the flag, attempts to
           undefine an inactive domain with snapshot metadata will fail.  If the domain is active,
           this flag is ignored.

           --nvram and --keep-nvram specify accordingly to delete or keep nvram (/domain/os/nvram/)
           file. If the domain has an nvram file and the flags are omitted, the undefine will fail.

           The --storage flag takes a parameter volumes, which is a comma separated list of volume
           target names or source paths of storage volumes to be removed along with the undefined
           domain. Volumes can be undefined and thus removed only on inactive domains. Volume deletion
           is only attempted after the domain is undefined; if not all of the requested volumes could
           be deleted, the error message indicates what still remains behind. If a volume path is not
           found in the domain definition, it's treated as if the volume was successfully deleted.
           Only volumes managed by libvirt in storage pools can be removed this way.  (See domblklist
           for list of target names associated to a domain).  Example: --storage
           vda,/path/to/storage.img

           The --remove-all-storage flag specifies that all of the domain's storage volumes should be
           deleted.

           The --delete-snapshots flag specifies that any snapshots associated with the storage volume
           should be deleted as well. Requires the --remove-all-storage flag to be provided. Not all
           storage drivers support this option, presently only rbd.

           The flag --wipe-storage specifies that the storage volumes should be wiped before removal.

           NOTE: For an inactive domain, the domain name or UUID must be used as the domain.

       vcpucount domain  [{--maximum | --active} {--config | --live | --current}] [--guest]
           Print information about the virtual cpu counts of the given domain.  If no flags are
           specified, all possible counts are listed in a table; otherwise, the output is limited to
           just the numeric value requested.  For historical reasons, the table lists the label
           "current" on the rows that can be queried in isolation via the --active flag, rather than
           relating to the --current flag.

           --maximum requests information on the maximum cap of vcpus that a domain can add via
           setvcpus, while --active shows the current usage; these two flags cannot both be specified.
           --config requires a persistent domain and requests information regarding the next time the
           domain will be booted, --live requires a running domain and lists current values, and
           --current queries according to the current state of the domain (corresponding to --live if
           running, or --config if inactive); these three flags are mutually exclusive.

           If --guest is specified, then the count of cpus is reported from the perspective of the
           guest. This flag is usable only for live domains and may require guest agent to be
           configured in the guest.

       vcpuinfo domain [--pretty]
           Returns basic information about the domain virtual CPUs, like the number of vCPUs, the
           running time, the affinity to physical processors.

           With --pretty, cpu affinities are shown as ranges.

           An example output is

            $ virsh vcpuinfo fedora
            VCPU:           0
            CPU:            0
            State:          running
            CPU time:       7,0s
            CPU Affinity:   yyyy

            VCPU:           1
            CPU:            1
            State:          running
            CPU time:       0,7s
            CPU Affinity:   yyyy

           STATES

           The State field displays the current operating state of a virtual CPU

           offline
               The virtual CPU is offline and not usable by the domain.  This state is not supported
               by all hypervisors.

           running
               The virtual CPU is available to the domain and is operating.

           blocked
               The virtual CPU is available to the domain but is waiting for a resource.  This state
               is not supported by all hypervisors, in which case running may be reported instead.

           no state
               The virtual CPU state could not be determined. This could happen if the hypervisor is
               newer than virsh.

           N/A There's no information about the virtual CPU state available. This can be the case if
               the domain is not running or the hypervisor does not report the virtual CPU state.

       vcpupin domain [vcpu] [cpulist] [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]
           Query or change the pinning of domain VCPUs to host physical CPUs.  To pin a single vcpu,
           specify cpulist; otherwise, you can query one vcpu or omit vcpu to list all at once.

           cpulist is a list of physical CPU numbers. Its syntax is a comma separated list and a
           special markup using '-' and '^' (ex. '0-4', '0-3,^2') can also be allowed. The '-' denotes
           the range and the '^' denotes exclusive.  For pinning the vcpu to all physical cpus specify
           'r' as a cpulist.  If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is
           specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect
           the current guest state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given if cpulist is
           present, but --current is exclusive.  If no flag is specified, behavior is different
           depending on hypervisor.

           Note: The expression is sequentially evaluated, so "0-15,^8" is identical to "9-14,0-7,15"
           but not identical to "^8,0-15".

       emulatorpin domain [cpulist] [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]
           Query or change the pinning of domain's emulator threads to host physical CPUs.

           See vcpupin for cpulist.

           If --live is specified, affect a running guest.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           boot of a persistent guest.  If --current is specified, affect the current guest state.
           Both --live and --config flags may be given if cpulist is present, but --current is
           exclusive.  If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

       guestvcpus domain [[--enable] | [--disable]] [cpulist]
           Query or change state of vCPUs from guest's point of view using the guest agent.  When
           invoked without cpulist the guest is queried for available guest vCPUs, their state and
           possibility to be offlined.

           If cpulist is provided then one of --enable or --disable must be provided too. The desired
           operation is then executed on the domain.

           See vcpupin for information on cpulist.

       vncdisplay domain
           Output the IP address and port number for the VNC display. If the information is not
           available the processes will provide an exit code of 1.

DEVICE COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate devices associated to domains.  The domain can be specified
       as a short integer, a name or a full UUID.  To better understand the values allowed as options
       for the command reading the documentation at <https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html> on the
       format of the device sections to get the most accurate set of accepted values.

       attach-device domain FILE [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]
           Attach a device to the domain, using a device definition in an XML file using a device
           definition element such as <disk> or <interface> as the top-level element.  See the
           documentation at <https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices> to learn about
           libvirt XML format for a device.  If --config is specified the command alters the
           persistent domain configuration with the device attach taking effect the next time libvirt
           starts the domain.  For cdrom and floppy devices, this command only replaces the media
           within an existing device; consider using update-device for this usage.  For passthrough
           host devices, see also nodedev-detach, needed if the PCI device does not use managed mode.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note: using of partial device definition XML files may lead to unexpected results as some
           fields may be autogenerated and thus match devices other than expected.

       attach-disk domain source target [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]

       cache] [--io io] [--type type] [--alias alias] [--mode mode] [--sourcetype sourcetype]
       [--serial serial] [--wwn wwn] [--rawio] [--address address] [--multifunction] [--print-xml]
           Attach a new disk device to the domain.  source is path for the files and devices. target
           controls the bus or device under which the disk is exposed to the guest OS. It indicates
           the "logical" device name; the optional targetbus attribute specifies the type of disk
           device to emulate; possible values are driver specific, with typical values being ide,
           scsi, virtio, xen, usb, sata, or sd, if omitted, the bus type is inferred from the style of
           the device name (e.g.  a device named 'sda' will typically be exported using a SCSI bus).
           driver can be file, tap or phy for the Xen hypervisor depending on the kind of access; or
           qemu for the QEMU emulator.  Further details to the driver can be passed using subdriver.
           For Xen subdriver can be aio, while for QEMU subdriver should match the format of the disk
           source, such as raw or qcow2.  Hypervisor default will be used if subdriver is not
           specified.  However, the default may not be correct, esp. for QEMU as for security reasons
           it is configured not to detect disk formats.  type can indicate lun, cdrom or floppy as
           alternative to the disk default, although this use only replaces the media within the
           existing virtual cdrom or floppy device; consider using update-device for this usage
           instead.  alias can set user supplied alias.  mode can specify the two specific mode
           readonly or shareable.  sourcetype can indicate the type of source (block|file) cache can
           be one of "default", "none", "writethrough", "writeback", "directsync" or "unsafe".  io
           controls specific policies on I/O; QEMU guests support "threads" and "native".  iothread is
           the number within the range of domain IOThreads to which this disk may be attached (QEMU
           only).  serial is the serial of disk device. wwn is the wwn of disk device.  rawio
           indicates the disk needs rawio capability.  address is the address of disk device in the
           form of pci:domain.bus.slot.function, scsi:controller.bus.unit, ide:controller.bus.unit,
           usb:bus.port, sata:controller.bus.unit or ccw:cssid.ssid.devno. Virtio-ccw devices must
           have their cssid set to 0xfe.  multifunction indicates specified pci address is a
           multifunction pci device address.

           If --print-xml is specified, then the XML of the disk that would be attached is printed
           instead.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.  Likewise, --shareable is an alias for --mode
           shareable.

       attach-interface domain type source [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]
       [--target target] [--mac mac] [--script script] [--model model] [--inbound
       average,peak,burst,floor] [--outbound average,peak,burst] [--alias alias] [--managed]
       [--print-xml]
           Attach a new network interface to the domain.

           type can be one of the:

               network to indicate connection via a libvirt virtual network,

               bridge to indicate connection via a bridge device on the host,

               direct to indicate connection directly to one of the host's network interfaces or
               bridges,

               hostdev to indicate connection using a passthrough of PCI device on the host.

           source indicates the source of the connection.  The source depends on the type of the
           interface:

               network name of the virtual network,

               bridge the name of the bridge device,

               direct the name of the host's interface or bridge,

               hostdev the PCI address of the host's interface formatted as domain:bus:slot.function.

           --target is used to specify the tap/macvtap device to be used to connect the domain to the
           source.  Names starting with 'vnet' are considered as auto-generated and are blanked
           out/regenerated each time the interface is attached.

           --mac specifies the MAC address of the network interface; if a MAC address is not given, a
           new address will be automatically generated (and stored in the persistent configuration if
           "--config" is given on the command line).

           --script is used to specify a path to a custom script to be called while attaching to a
           bridge - this will be called instead of the default script not in addition to it.  This is
           valid only for interfaces of bridge type and only for Xen domains.

           --model specifies the network device model to be presented to the domain.

           alias can set user supplied alias.

           --inbound and --outbound control the bandwidth of the interface.  At least one from the
           average, floor pair must be specified.  The other two peak and burst are optional, so
           "average,peak", "average,,burst", "average,,,floor", "average" and ",,,floor" are also
           legal.  Values for average, floor and peak are expressed in kilobytes per second, while
           burst is expressed in kilobytes in a single burst at peak speed as described in the Network
           XML documentation at <https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html#elementQoS>.

           --managed is usable only for hostdev type and tells libvirt that the interface should be
           managed, which means detached and reattached from/to the host by libvirt.

           If --print-xml is specified, then the XML of the interface that would be attached is
           printed instead.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive.  When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note: the optional target value is the name of a device to be created as the back-end on
           the node.  If not provided a device named "vnetN" or "vifN" will be created automatically.

       detach-device domain FILE [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]
           Detach a device from the domain, takes the same kind of XML descriptions as command attach-
           device.  For passthrough host devices, see also nodedev-reattach, needed if the device does
           not use managed mode.

           Note: The supplied XML description of the device should be as specific as its definition in
           the domain XML. The set of attributes used to match the device are internal to the drivers.
           Using a partial definition, or attempting to detach a device that is not present in the
           domain XML, but shares some specific attributes with one that is present, may lead to
           unexpected results.

           Quirk: Device unplug is asynchronous in most cases and requires guest cooperation. This
           means that it's up to the discretion of the guest to disallow or delay the unplug
           arbitrarily. As the libvirt API used in this command was designed as synchronous it returns
           success after some timeout even if the device was not unplugged yet to allow further
           interactions with the domain e.g. if the guest is unresponsive. Callers which need to make
           sure that the device was unplugged can use libvirt events (see virsh event) to be notified
           when the device is removed. Note that the event may arrive before the command returns.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note that older versions of virsh used --config as an alias for --persistent.

       detach-device-alias domain alias [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]]]]
           Detach a device with given alias from the domain. This command returns successfully after
           the unplug request was sent to the hypervisor. The actual removal of the device is notified
           asynchronously via libvirt events (see virsh event).

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive.

       detach-disk domain target [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]] [--print-xml]
           Detach a disk device from a domain. The target is the device as seen from the domain.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note that older versions of virsh used --config as an alias for --persistent.

           If --print-xml is specified, then the XML which would be used to detach the disk is printed
           instead.

           Please see documentation for detach-device for known quirks.

       detach-interface domain type [--mac mac] [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]
           Detach a network interface from a domain.  type can be either network to indicate a
           physical network device or bridge to indicate a bridge to a device. It is recommended to
           use the mac option to distinguish between the interfaces if more than one are present on
           the domain.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. When no
           flag is specified legacy API is used whose behavior depends on the hypervisor driver.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note that older versions of virsh used --config as an alias for --persistent.

           Please see documentation for detach-device for known quirks.

       update-device domain file [--force] [[[--live] [--config] | [--current]] | [--persistent]]
           Update the characteristics of a device associated with domain, based on the device
           definition in an XML file.  The --force option can be used to force device update, e.g., to
           eject a CD-ROM even if it is locked/mounted in the domain. See the documentation at
           <https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDevices> to learn about libvirt XML format
           for a device.

           If --live is specified, affect a running domain.  If --config is specified, affect the next
           startup of a persistent domain.  If --current is specified, affect the current domain
           state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive. Not
           specifying any flag is the same as specifying --current.

           For compatibility purposes, --persistent behaves like --config for an offline domain, and
           like --live --config for a running domain.

           Note that older versions of virsh used --config as an alias for --persistent.

           Note: using of partial device definition XML files may lead to unexpected results as some
           fields may be autogenerated and thus match devices other than expected.

       change-media domain path [--eject] [--insert] [--update] [source] [--force] [[--live]
       [--config] | [--current]] [--print-xml] [--block]
           Change media of CDROM or floppy drive. path can be the fully-qualified path or the unique
           target name (<target dev='hdc'>) of the disk device. source specifies the path of the media
           to be inserted or updated. The --block flag allows setting the backing type in case a block
           device is used as media for the CDROM or floppy drive instead of a file.

           --eject indicates the media will be ejected.  --insert indicates the media will be
           inserted. source must be specified.  If the device has source (e.g. <source file='media'>),
           and source is not specified, --update is equal to --eject. If the device has no source, and
           source is specified, --update is equal to --insert. If the device has source, and source is
           specified, --update behaves like combination of --eject and --insert.  If none of --eject,
           --insert, and --update is specified, --update is used by default.  The --force option can
           be used to force media changing.  If --live is specified, alter live configuration of
           running guest.  If --config is specified, alter persistent configuration, effect observed
           on next boot.  --current can be either or both of live and config, depends on the
           hypervisor's implementation.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is
           exclusive. If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.  If
           --print-xml is specified, the XML that would be used to change media is printed instead of
           changing the media.

NODEDEV COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate host devices that are intended to be passed through to guest
       domains via <hostdev> elements in a domain's <devices> section.  A node device key is generally
       specified by the bus name followed by its address, using underscores between all components,
       such as pci_0000_00_02_1, usb_1_5_3, or net_eth1_00_27_13_6a_fe_00.  The nodedev-list gives the
       full list of host devices that are known to libvirt, although this includes devices that cannot
       be assigned to a guest (for example, attempting to detach the PCI device that controls the
       host's hard disk controller where the guest's disk images live could cause the host system to
       lock up or reboot).

       For more information on node device definition see: <https://libvirt.org/formatnode.html>.

       Passthrough devices cannot be simultaneously used by the host and its guest domains, nor by
       multiple active guests at once.  If the <hostdev> description of a PCI device includes the
       attribute managed='yes', and the hypervisor driver supports it, then the device is in managed
       mode, and attempts to use that passthrough device in an active guest will automatically behave
       as if nodedev-detach (guest start, device hot-plug) and nodedev-reattach (guest stop, device
       hot-unplug) were called at the right points.  If a PCI device is not marked as managed, then it
       must manually be detached before guests can use it, and manually reattached to be returned to
       the host.  Also, if a device is manually detached, then the host does not regain control of the
       device without a matching reattach, even if the guests use the device in managed mode.

       nodedev-create FILE
           Create a device on the host node that can then be assigned to virtual machines. Normally,
           libvirt is able to automatically determine which host nodes are available for use, but this
           allows registration of host hardware that libvirt did not automatically detect.  file
           contains xml for a top-level <device> description of a node device.

       nodedev-destroy device
           Destroy (stop) a device on the host. device can be either device name or wwn pair in
           "wwnn,wwpn" format (only works for vHBA currently).  Note that this makes libvirt quit
           managing a host device, and may even make that device unusable by the rest of the physical
           host until a reboot.

       nodedev-detach nodedev [--driver backend_driver]
           Detach nodedev from the host, so that it can safely be used by guests via <hostdev>
           passthrough.  This is reversed with nodedev-reattach, and is done automatically for managed
           devices.

           Different backend drivers expect the device to be bound to different dummy devices. For
           example, QEMU's "kvm" backend driver (the default) expects the device to be bound to pci-
           stub, but its "vfio" backend driver expects the device to be bound to vfio-pci. The
           --driver parameter can be used to specify the desired backend driver.

       nodedev-dumpxml device
           Dump a <device> XML representation for the given node device, including such information as
           the device name, which bus owns the device, the vendor and product id, and any capabilities
           of the device usable by libvirt (such as whether device reset is supported). device can be
           either device name or wwn pair in "wwnn,wwpn" format (only works for HBA).

       nodedev-list cap --tree
           List all of the devices available on the node that are known by libvirt.  cap is used to
           filter the list by capability types, the types must be separated by comma, e.g. --cap
           pci,scsi. Valid capability types include 'system', 'pci', 'usb_device', 'usb', 'net',
           'scsi_host', 'scsi_target', 'scsi', 'storage', 'fc_host', 'vports', 'scsi_generic', 'drm',
           'mdev', 'mdev_types', 'ccw'.  If --tree is used, the output is formatted in a tree
           representing parents of each node.  cap and --tree are mutually exclusive.

       nodedev-reattach nodedev
           Declare that nodedev is no longer in use by any guests, and that the host can resume normal
           use of the device.  This is done automatically for PCI devices in managed mode and USB
           devices, but must be done explicitly to match any explicit nodedev-detach.

       nodedev-reset nodedev
           Trigger a device reset for nodedev, useful prior to transferring a node device between
           guest passthrough or the host.  Libvirt will often do this action implicitly when required,
           but this command allows an explicit reset when needed.

       nodedev-event {[nodedev] event [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--timestamp] | --list}
           Wait for a class of node device events to occur, and print appropriate details of events as
           they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by nodedev.  Using --list as the only
           argument will provide a list of possible event values known by this client, although the
           connection might not allow registering for all these events.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.   With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event.

VIRTUAL NETWORK COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate networks. Libvirt has the capability to define virtual
       networks which can then be used by domains and linked to actual network devices. For more
       detailed information about this feature see the documentation at
       <https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html> . Many of the commands for virtual networks are
       similar to the ones used for domains, but the way to name a virtual network is either by its
       name or UUID.

       net-autostart network [--disable]
           Configure a virtual network to be automatically started at boot.  The --disable option
           disable autostarting.

       net-create file
           Create a transient (temporary) virtual network from an XML file and instantiate (start) the
           network.  See the documentation at <https://libvirt.org/formatnetwork.html> to get a
           description of the XML network format used by libvirt.

       net-define file
           Define an inactive persistent virtual network or modify an existing persistent one from the
           XML file.

       net-destroy network
           Destroy (stop) a given transient or persistent virtual network specified by its name or
           UUID. This takes effect immediately.

       net-dumpxml network [--inactive]
           Output the virtual network information as an XML dump to stdout.  If --inactive is
           specified, then physical functions are not expanded into their associated virtual
           functions.

       net-edit network
           Edit the XML configuration file for a network.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh net-dumpxml --inactive network > network.xml
            vi network.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh net-define network.xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       net-event {[network] event [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--timestamp] | --list}
           Wait for a class of network events to occur, and print appropriate details of events as
           they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by network.  Using --list as the only
           argument will provide a list of possible event values known by this client, although the
           connection might not allow registering for all these events.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.   With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event.

       net-info network
           Returns basic information about the network object.

       net-list [--inactive | --all] { [--table] | --name | --uuid } [--persistent] [<--transient>]
       [--autostart] [<--no-autostart>]
           Returns the list of active networks, if --all is specified this will also include defined
           but inactive networks, if --inactive is specified only the inactive ones will be listed.
           You may also want to filter the returned networks by --persistent to list the persistent
           ones, --transient to list the transient ones, --autostart to list the ones with autostart
           enabled, and --no-autostart to list the ones with autostart disabled.

           If --name is specified, network names are printed instead of the table formatted one per
           line. If --uuid is specified network's UUID's are printed instead of names. Flag --table
           specifies that the legacy table-formatted output should be used. This is the default. All
           of these are mutually exclusive.

           NOTE: When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API calls
           with an inherent race, where a pool might not be listed or might appear more than once if
           it changed state between calls while the list was being collected.  Newer servers do not
           have this problem.

       net-name network-UUID
           Convert a network UUID to network name.

       net-start network
           Start a (previously defined) inactive network.

       net-undefine network
           Undefine the configuration for a persistent network. If the network is active, make it
           transient.

       net-uuid network-name
           Convert a network name to network UUID.

       net-update network command section xml [--parent-index index] [[--live] [--config] |
       [--current]]
           Update the given section of an existing network definition, with the changes optionally
           taking effect immediately, without needing to destroy and re-start the network.

           command is one of "add-first", "add-last", "add" (a synonym for add-last), "delete", or
           "modify".

           section is one of "bridge", "domain", "ip", "ip-dhcp-host", "ip-dhcp-range", "forward",
           "forward-interface", "forward-pf", "portgroup", "dns-host", "dns-txt", or "dns-srv", each
           section being named by a concatenation of the xml element hierarchy leading to the element
           being changed. For example, "ip-dhcp-host" will change a <host> element that is contained
           inside a <dhcp> element inside an <ip> element of the network.

           xml is either the text of a complete xml element of the type being changed (e.g. "<host
           mac="00:11:22:33:44:55' ip='1.2.3.4'/>", or the name of a file that contains a complete xml
           element. Disambiguation is done by looking at the first character of the provided text - if
           the first character is "<", it is xml text, if the first character is not "<", it is the
           name of a file that contains the xml text to be used.

           The --parent-index option is used to specify which of several parent elements the requested
           element is in (0-based). For example, a dhcp <host> element could be in any one of multiple
           <ip> elements in the network; if a parent-index isn't provided, the "most appropriate" <ip>
           element will be selected (usually the only one that already has a <dhcp> element), but if
           --parent-index is given, that particular instance of <ip> will get the modification.

           If --live is specified, affect a running network.  If --config is specified, affect the
           next startup of a persistent network.  If --current is specified, affect the current
           network state.  Both --live and --config flags may be given, but --current is exclusive.
           Not specifying any flag is the same as specifying --current.

       net-dhcp-leases network [mac]
           Get a list of dhcp leases for all network interfaces connected to the given virtual network
           or limited output just for one interface if mac is specified.

INTERFACE COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate host interfaces.  Often, these host interfaces can then be
       used by name within domain <interface> elements (such as a system-created bridge interface),
       but there is no requirement that host interfaces be tied to any particular guest configuration
       XML at all.

       Many of the commands for host interfaces are similar to the ones used for domains, and the way
       to name an interface is either by its name or its MAC address.  However, using a MAC address
       for an iface argument only works when that address is unique (if an interface and a bridge
       share the same MAC address, which is often the case, then using that MAC address results in an
       error due to ambiguity, and you must resort to a name instead).

       iface-bridge interface bridge [--no-stp] [delay] [--no-start]
           Create a bridge device named bridge, and attach the existing network device interface to
           the new bridge.  The new bridge defaults to starting immediately, with STP enabled and a
           delay of 0; these settings can be altered with --no-stp, --no-start, and an integer number
           of seconds for delay. All IP address configuration of interface will be moved to the new
           bridge device.

           See also iface-unbridge for undoing this operation.

       iface-define file
           Define an inactive persistent physical host interface or modify an existing persistent one
           from the XML file.

       iface-destroy interface
           Destroy (stop) a given host interface, such as by running "if-down" to disable that
           interface from active use. This takes effect immediately.

       iface-dumpxml interface [--inactive]
           Output the host interface information as an XML dump to stdout.  If --inactive is
           specified, then the output reflects the persistent state of the interface that will be used
           the next time it is started.

       iface-edit interface
           Edit the XML configuration file for a host interface.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh iface-dumpxml iface > iface.xml
            vi iface.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh iface-define iface.xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       iface-list [--inactive | --all]
           Returns the list of active host interfaces.  If --all is specified this will also include
           defined but inactive interfaces.  If --inactive is specified only the inactive ones will be
           listed.

       iface-name interface
           Convert a host interface MAC to interface name, if the MAC address is unique among the
           host's interfaces.

           interface specifies the interface MAC address.

       iface-mac interface
           Convert a host interface name to MAC address.

           interface specifies the interface name.

       iface-start interface
           Start a (previously defined) host interface, such as by running "if-up".

       iface-unbridge bridge [--no-start]
           Tear down a bridge device named bridge, releasing its underlying interface back to normal
           usage, and moving all IP address configuration from the bridge device to the underlying
           device.  The underlying interface is restarted unless --no-start is present; this flag is
           present for symmetry, but generally not recommended.

           See also iface-bridge for creating a bridge.

       iface-undefine interface
           Undefine the configuration for an inactive host interface.

       iface-begin
           Create a snapshot of current host interface settings, which can later be committed (iface-
           commit) or restored (iface-rollback).  If a snapshot already exists, then this command will
           fail until the previous snapshot has been committed or restored.  Undefined behavior
           results if any external changes are made to host interfaces outside of the libvirt API
           between the beginning of a snapshot and its eventual commit or rollback.

       iface-commit
           Declare all changes since the last iface-begin as working, and delete the rollback point.
           If no interface snapshot has already been started, then this command will fail.

       iface-rollback
           Revert all host interface settings back to the state recorded in the last iface-begin.  If
           no interface snapshot has already been started, then this command will fail.  Rebooting the
           host also serves as an implicit rollback point.

STORAGE POOL COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate storage pools. Libvirt has the capability to manage various
       storage solutions, including files, raw partitions, and domain-specific formats, used to
       provide the storage volumes visible as devices within virtual machines. For more detailed
       information about this feature, see the documentation at
       <https://libvirt.org/formatstorage.html> . Many of the commands for pools are similar to the
       ones used for domains.

       find-storage-pool-sources type [srcSpec]
           Returns XML describing all possible available storage pool sources that could be used to
           create or define a storage pool of a given type. If srcSpec is provided, it is a file that
           contains XML to further restrict the query for pools.

           Not all storage pools support discovery in this manner. Furthermore, for those that do
           support discovery, only specific XML elements are required in order to return valid data,
           while other elements and even attributes of some elements are ignored since they are not
           necessary to find the pool based on the search criteria. The following lists the supported
           type options and the expected minimal XML elements used to perform the search.

           For a "netfs" or "gluster" pool, the minimal expected XML required is the <host> element
           with a "name" attribute describing the IP address or hostname to be used to find the pool.
           The "port" attribute will be ignored as will any other provided XML elements in srcSpec.

           For a "logical" pool, the contents of the srcSpec file are ignored, although if provided
           the file must at least exist.

           For an "iscsi" pool, the minimal expect XML required is the <host> element with a "name"
           attribute describing the IP address or hostname to be used to find the pool (the iSCSI
           server address). Optionally, the "port" attribute may be provided, although it will default
           to 3260. Optionally, an <initiator> XML element with a "name" attribute may be provided to
           further restrict the iSCSI target search to a specific initiator for multi-iqn iSCSI
           storage pools.

       find-storage-pool-sources-as type [host] [port] [initiator]
           Rather than providing srcSpec XML file for find-storage-pool-sources use this command
           option in order to have virsh generate the query XML file using the optional arguments. The
           command will return the same output XML as find-storage-pool-sources.

           Use host to describe a specific host to use for networked storage, such as netfs, gluster,
           and iscsi type pools.

           Use port to further restrict which networked port to utilize for the connection if required
           by the specific storage backend, such as iscsi.

           Use initiator to further restrict the iscsi type pool searches to specific target
           initiators.

       pool-autostart pool-or-uuid [--disable]
           Configure whether pool should automatically start at boot.

       pool-build pool-or-uuid [--overwrite] [--no-overwrite]
           Build a given pool.

           Options --overwrite and --no-overwrite can only be used for pool-build a filesystem, disk,
           or logical pool.

           For a file system pool if neither flag is specified, then pool-build just makes the target
           path directory and no attempt to run mkfs on the target volume device. If --no-overwrite is
           specified, it probes to determine if a filesystem already exists on the target device,
           returning an error if one exists or using mkfs to format the target device if not.  If
           --overwrite is specified, mkfs is always executed and any existing data on the target
           device is overwritten unconditionally.

           For a disk pool, if neither of them is specified or --no-overwrite is specified, pool-build
           will check the target volume device for existing filesystems or partitions before
           attempting to write a new label on the target volume device. If the target volume device
           already has a label, the command will fail. If --overwrite is specified, then no check will
           be made on the target volume device prior to writing a new label. Writing of the label uses
           the pool source format type or "dos" if not specified.

           For a logical pool, if neither of them is specified or --no-overwrite is specified, pool-
           build will check the target volume devices for existing filesystems or partitions before
           attempting to initialize and format each device for usage by the logical pool. If any
           target volume device already has a label, the command will fail. If --overwrite is
           specified, then no check will be made on the target volume devices prior to initializing
           and formatting each device. Once all the target volume devices are properly formatted via
           pvcreate, the volume group will be created using all the devices.

       pool-create file [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]]
           Create and start a pool object from the XML file.

           [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]] perform a pool-build after creation in order
           to remove the need for a follow-up command to build the pool. The --overwrite and
           --no-overwrite flags follow the same rules as pool-build. If just --build is provided, then
           pool-build is called with no flags.

       pool-create-as name type [--source-host hostname] [--source-path path] [--source-dev path]
       [--source-name name] [--target path] [--source-format format] [--auth-type authtype
       --auth-username username [--secret-usage usage | --secret-uuid uuid]] [--source-protocol-ver
       ver] [[--adapter-name name] | [--adapter-wwnn wwnn --adapter-wwpn wwpn] [--adapter-parent
       parent | --adapter-parent-wwnn parent_wwnn adapter-parent-wwpn parent_wwpn |
       --adapter-parent-fabric-wwn parent_fabric_wwn]] [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]]
       [--print-xml]
           Create and start a pool object name from the raw parameters.  If --print-xml is specified,
           then print the XML of the pool object without creating the pool.  Otherwise, the pool has
           the specified type. When using pool-create-as for a pool of type "disk", the existing
           partitions found on the --source-dev path will be used to populate the disk pool.
           Therefore, it is suggested to use pool-define-as and pool-build with the --overwrite in
           order to properly initialize the disk pool.

           [--source-host hostname] provides the source hostname for pools backed by storage from a
           remote server (pool types netfs, iscsi, rbd, sheepdog, gluster).

           [--source-path path] provides the source directory path for pools backed by directories
           (pool type dir).

           [--source-dev path] provides the source path for pools backed by physical devices (pool
           types fs, logical, disk, iscsi, zfs).

           [--source-name name] provides the source name for pools backed by storage from a named
           element (pool types logical, rbd, sheepdog, gluster).

           [--target path] is the path for the mapping of the storage pool into the host file system.

           [--source-format format] provides information about the format of the pool (pool types fs,
           netfs, disk, logical).

           [--auth-type authtype --auth-username username [--secret-usage usage | --secret-uuid uuid]]
           provides the elements required to generate authentication credentials for the storage pool.
           The authtype is either chap for iscsi type pools or ceph for rbd type pools. Either the
           secret usage or uuid value may be provided, but not both.

           [--source-protocol-ver ver] provides the NFS protocol version number used to contact the
           server's NFS service via nfs mount option 'nfsvers=n'. It is expect the ver value is an
           unsigned integer.

           [--adapter-name name] defines the scsi_hostN adapter name to be used for the scsi_host
           adapter type pool.

           [--adapter-wwnn wwnn --adapter-wwpn wwpn [--adapter-parent parent | --adapter-parent-wwnn
           parent_wwnn adapter-parent-wwpn parent_wwpn | --adapter-parent-fabric-wwn
           parent_fabric_wwn]] defines the wwnn and wwpn to be used for the fc_host adapter type pool.
           Optionally provide the parent scsi_hostN node device to be used for the vHBA either by
           parent name, parent_wwnn and parent_wwpn, or parent_fabric_wwn.  The parent name could
           change between reboots if the hardware environment changes, so providing the parent_wwnn
           and parent_wwpn ensure usage of the same physical HBA even if the scsi_hostN node device
           changes. Usage of the parent_fabric_wwn allows a bit more flexibility to choose an HBA on
           the same storage fabric in order to define the pool.

           [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]] perform a pool-build after creation in order
           to remove the need for a follow-up command to build the pool. The --overwrite and
           --no-overwrite flags follow the same rules as pool-build. If just --build is provided, then
           pool-build is called with no flags.

           For a "logical" pool only [--name] needs to be provided. The [--source-name] if provided
           must match the Volume Group name.  If not provided, one will be generated using the
           [--name]. If provided the [--target] is ignored and a target source is generated using the
           [--source-name] (or as generated from the [--name]).

       pool-define file
           Define an inactive persistent storage pool or modify an existing persistent one from the
           XML file.

       pool-define-as name type [--source-host hostname] [--source-path path] [--source-dev path]
       [--source-name name] [--target path] [--source-format format] [--auth-type authtype
       --auth-username username [--secret-usage usage | --secret-uuid uuid]] [--source-protocol-ver
       ver] [[--adapter-name name] | [--adapter-wwnn --adapter-wwpn] [--adapter-parent parent]]
       [--print-xml]
           Create, but do not start, a pool object name from the raw parameters.  If --print-xml is
           specified, then print the XML of the pool object without defining the pool.  Otherwise, the
           pool has the specified type.

           Use the same arguments as pool-create-as, except for the --build, --overwrite, and
           --no-overwrite options.

       pool-destroy pool-or-uuid
           Destroy (stop) a given pool object. Libvirt will no longer manage the storage described by
           the pool object, but the raw data contained in the pool is not changed, and can be later
           recovered with pool-create.

       pool-delete pool-or-uuid
           Destroy the resources used by a given pool object. This operation is non-recoverable.  The
           pool object will still exist after this command, ready for the creation of new storage
           volumes.

       pool-dumpxml [--inactive] pool-or-uuid
           Returns the XML information about the pool object.  --inactive tells virsh to dump pool
           configuration that will be used on next start of the pool as opposed to the current pool
           configuration.

       pool-edit pool-or-uuid
           Edit the XML configuration file for a storage pool.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh pool-dumpxml pool > pool.xml
            vi pool.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh pool-define pool.xml

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

       pool-info [--bytes] pool-or-uuid
           Returns basic information about the pool object. If --bytes is specified the sizes of basic
           info are not converted to human friendly units.

       pool-list [--inactive] [--all] [--persistent] [--transient] [--autostart] [--no-autostart]
       [[--details] [--uuid] [--name] [<type>]
           List pool objects known to libvirt.  By default, only active pools are listed; --inactive
           lists just the inactive pools, and --all lists all pools.

           In addition, there are several sets of filtering flags. --persistent is to list the
           persistent pools, --transient is to list the transient pools.  --autostart lists the
           autostarting pools, --no-autostart lists the pools with autostarting disabled. If --uuid is
           specified only pool's UUIDs are printed.  If --name is specified only pool's names are
           printed. If both --name and --uuid are specified, pool's UUID and names are printed side by
           side without any header. Option --details is mutually exclusive with options --uuid and
           --name.

           You may also want to list pools with specified types using type, the pool types must be
           separated by comma, e.g. --type dir,disk. The valid pool types include 'dir', 'fs',
           'netfs', 'logical', 'disk', 'iscsi', 'scsi', 'mpath', 'rbd', 'sheepdog' and 'gluster'.

           The --details option instructs virsh to additionally display pool persistence and capacity
           related information where available.

           NOTE: When talking to older servers, this command is forced to use a series of API calls
           with an inherent race, where a pool might not be listed or might appear more than once if
           it changed state between calls while the list was being collected.  Newer servers do not
           have this problem.

       pool-name uuid
           Convert the uuid to a pool name.

       pool-refresh pool-or-uuid
           Refresh the list of volumes contained in pool.

       pool-start pool-or-uuid [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]]
           Start the storage pool, which is previously defined but inactive.

           [--build] [[--overwrite] | [--no-overwrite]] perform a pool-build prior to pool-start to
           ensure the pool environment is in an expected state rather than needing to run the build
           command prior to startup. The --overwrite and --no-overwrite flags follow the same rules as
           pool-build. If just --build is provided, then pool-build is called with no flags.

           Note: A storage pool that relies on remote resources such as an "iscsi" or a (v)HBA backed
           "scsi" pool may need to be refreshed multiple times in order to have all the volumes
           detected (see pool-refresh).  This is because the corresponding volume devices may not be
           present in the host's filesystem during the initial pool startup or the current refresh
           attempt. The number of refresh retries is dependent upon the network connection and the
           time the host takes to export the corresponding devices.

       pool-undefine pool-or-uuid
           Undefine the configuration for an inactive pool.

       pool-uuid pool
           Returns the UUID of the named pool.

       pool-event {[pool] event [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--timestamp] | --list}
           Wait for a class of storage pool events to occur, and print appropriate details of events
           as they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by pool.  Using --list as the only
           argument will provide a list of possible event values known by this client, although the
           connection might not allow registering for all these events.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.   With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event.

VOLUME COMMANDS
       vol-create pool-or-uuid FILE [--prealloc-metadata]
           Create a volume from an XML <file>.

           pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool to create the volume in.

           FILE is the XML <file> with the volume definition. An easy way to create the XML <file> is
           to use the vol-dumpxml command to obtain the definition of a pre-existing volume.

           [--prealloc-metadata] preallocate metadata (for qcow2 images which don't support full
           allocation). This option creates a sparse image file with metadata, resulting in higher
           performance compared to images with no preallocation and only slightly higher initial disk
           space usage.

           Example

            virsh vol-dumpxml --pool storagepool1 appvolume1 > newvolume.xml
            vi newvolume.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh vol-create differentstoragepool newvolume.xml

       vol-create-from pool-or-uuid FILE vol-name-or-key-or-path [--inputpool pool-or-uuid]
       [--prealloc-metadata] [--reflink]
           Create a volume, using another volume as input.

           pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool to create the volume in.

           FILE is the XML <file> with the volume definition.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the source volume.

           --inputpool pool-or-uuid is the name or uuid of the storage pool the source volume is in.

           [--prealloc-metadata] preallocate metadata (for qcow2 images which don't support full
           allocation). This option creates a sparse image file with metadata, resulting in higher
           performance compared to images with no preallocation and only slightly higher initial disk
           space usage.

           When --reflink is specified, perform a COW lightweight copy, where the data blocks are
           copied only when modified.  If this is not possible, the copy fails.

       vol-create-as pool-or-uuid name capacity [--allocation size] [--format string] [--backing-vol
       vol-name-or-key-or-path] [--backing-vol-format string] [--prealloc-metadata] [--print-xml]
           Create a volume from a set of arguments unless --print-xml is specified, in which case just
           the XML of the volume object is printed out without any actual object creation.

           pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool to create the volume in.

           name is the name of the new volume. For a disk pool, this must match the partition name as
           determined from the pool's source device path and the next available partition. For
           example, a source device path of /dev/sdb and there are no partitions on the disk, then the
           name must be sdb1 with the next name being sdb2 and so on.

           capacity is the size of the volume to be created, as a scaled integer (see NOTES above),
           defaulting to bytes if there is no suffix.

           --allocation size is the initial size to be allocated in the volume, also as a scaled
           integer defaulting to bytes.

           --format string is used in file based storage pools to specify the volume file format to
           use; raw, bochs, qcow, qcow2, vmdk, qed. Use extended for disk storage pools in order to
           create an extended partition (other values are validity checked but not preserved when
           libvirtd is restarted or the pool is refreshed).

           --backing-vol vol-name-or-key-or-path is the source backing volume to be used if taking a
           snapshot of an existing volume.

           --backing-vol-format string is the format of the snapshot backing volume; raw, bochs, qcow,
           qcow2, qed, vmdk, host_device. These are, however, meant for file based storage pools.

           [--prealloc-metadata] preallocate metadata (for qcow2 images which don't support full
           allocation). This option creates a sparse image file with metadata, resulting in higher
           performance compared to images with no preallocation and only slightly higher initial disk
           space usage.

       vol-clone vol-name-or-key-or-path name [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--prealloc-metadata] [--reflink]
           Clone an existing volume within the parent pool.  Less powerful, but easier to type,
           version of vol-create-from.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the source volume.

           name is the name of the new volume.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool that contains the source volume
           and will contain the new volume.  If the source volume name is provided instead of the key
           or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find the volume to be cloned; otherwise,
           the first volume found by the key or path will be used.

           [--prealloc-metadata] preallocate metadata (for qcow2 images which don't support full
           allocation). This option creates a sparse image file with metadata, resulting in higher
           performance compared to images with no preallocation and only slightly higher initial disk
           space usage.

           When --reflink is specified, perform a COW lightweight copy, where the data blocks are
           copied only when modified.  If this is not possible, the copy fails.

       vol-delete vol-name-or-key-or-path [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--delete-snapshots]
           Delete a given volume.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the volume name or key or path of the volume to delete.

           [--pool pool-or-uuid] is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the
           volume name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to
           find the volume to be deleted; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will be
           used.

           The --delete-snapshots flag specifies that any snapshots associated with the storage volume
           should be deleted as well. Not all storage drivers support this option, presently only rbd.

       vol-upload vol-name-or-key-or-path local-file [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--offset bytes] [--length
       bytes] [--sparse]
           Upload the contents of local-file to a storage volume.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume where the local-file will
           be uploaded.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will
           be used.

           --offset is the position in the storage volume at which to start writing the data. The
           value must be 0 or larger.

           --length is an upper bound of the amount of data to be uploaded.  A negative value is
           interpreted as an unsigned long long value to essentially include everything from the
           offset to the end of the volume.

           If --sparse is specified, this command will preserve volume sparseness.

           An error will occur if the local-file is greater than the specified length.

           See the description for the libvirt virStorageVolUpload API for details regarding possible
           target volume and pool changes as a result of the pool refresh when the upload is
           attempted.

       vol-download vol-name-or-key-or-path local-file [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--offset bytes]
       [--length bytes] [--sparse]
           Download the contents of a storage volume to local-file.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume to download into local-
           file.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will
           be used.

           --offset is the position in the storage volume at which to start reading the data. The
           value must be 0 or larger.

           --length is an upper bound of the amount of data to be downloaded.  A negative value is
           interpreted as an unsigned long long value to essentially include everything from the
           offset to the end of the volume.

           If --sparse is specified, this command will preserve volume sparseness.

       vol-wipe vol-name-or-key-or-path [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--algorithm algorithm]
           Wipe a volume, ensure data previously on the volume is not accessible to future reads.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume to wipe.  It is possible
           to choose different wiping algorithms instead of re-writing volume with zeroes.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be wiped; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will be used.

           Use the --algorithm switch choosing from the list of the following algorithms in order to
           define which algorithm to use for the wipe.

           Supported algorithms
             zero       - 1-pass all zeroes
             nnsa       - 4-pass NNSA Policy Letter NAP-14.1-C (XVI-8) for

                          Gutmann's paper.
             schneier   - 7-pass method described by Bruce Schneier in

             random     - 1-pass pattern: random.
             trim       - 1-pass trimming the volume using TRIM or DISCARD

           Note: The "scrub" binary will be used to handle the 'nnsa', 'dod', 'bsi', 'gutmann',
           'schneier', 'pfitzner7' and 'pfitzner33' algorithms.  The availability of the algorithms
           may be limited by the version of the "scrub" binary installed on the host. The 'zero'
           algorithm will write zeroes to the entire volume. For some volumes, such as sparse or rbd
           volumes, this may result in completely filling the volume with zeroes making it appear to
           be completely full. As an alternative, the 'trim' algorithm does not overwrite all the data
           in a volume, rather it expects the storage driver to be able to discard all bytes in a
           volume. It is up to the storage driver to handle how the discarding occurs. Not all storage
           drivers or volume types can support 'trim'.

       vol-dumpxml vol-name-or-key-or-path [--pool pool-or-uuid]
           Output the volume information as an XML dump to stdout.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume to output the XML.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will
           be used.

       vol-info vol-name-or-key-or-path [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--bytes] [--physical]
           Returns basic information about the given storage volume.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume to return information for.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will
           be used.

           If --bytes is specified the sizes are not converted to human friendly units.

           If --physical is specified, then the host physical size is returned and displayed instead
           of the allocation value. The physical value for some file types, such as qcow2 may have a
           different (larger) physical value than is shown for allocation. Additionally sparse files
           will have different physical and allocation values.

       vol-list [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--details]
           Return the list of volumes in the given storage pool.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool.

           The --details option instructs virsh to additionally display volume type and capacity
           related information where available.

       vol-pool vol-key-or-path [--uuid]
           Return the pool name or UUID for a given volume. By default, the pool name is returned.

           vol-key-or-path is the key or path of the volume to return the pool information.

           If the --uuid option is given, the pool UUID is returned instead.

       vol-path vol-name-or-key [--pool pool-or-uuid]
           Return the path for a given volume.

           vol-name-or-key is the name or key of the volume to return the path.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key, then providing the pool is necessary to find the
           volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key will be used.

       vol-name vol-key-or-path
           Return the name for a given volume.

           vol-key-or-path is the key or path of the volume to return the name.

       vol-key vol-name-or-path [--pool pool-or-uuid]
           Return the volume key for a given volume.

           vol-name-or-path is the name or path of the volume to return the volume key.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the path, then providing the pool is necessary to find the
           volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the path will be used.

       vol-resize vol-name-or-path capacity [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--allocate] [--delta] [--shrink]
           Resize the capacity of the given volume, in bytes.

           vol-name-or-key-or-path is the name or key or path of the volume to resize.

           capacity is a scaled integer (see NOTES above) for the volume, which defaults to bytes if
           there is no suffix.

           --pool pool-or-uuid is the name or UUID of the storage pool the volume is in. If the volume
           name is provided instead of the key or path, then providing the pool is necessary to find
           the volume to be uploaded into; otherwise, the first volume found by the key or path will
           be used.

           The new capacity might be sparse unless --allocate is specified.

           Normally, capacity is the new size, but if --delta is present, then it is added to the
           existing size.

           Attempts to shrink the volume will fail unless --shrink is present.  The capacity cannot be
           negative unless --shrink is provided, but a negative sign is not necessary.

           This command is only safe for storage volumes not in use by an active guest; see also
           blockresize for live resizing.

SECRET COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate "secrets" (e.g. passwords, passphrases and encryption keys).
       Libvirt can store secrets independently from their use, and other objects (e.g. volumes or
       domains) can refer to the secrets for encryption or possibly other uses.  Secrets are
       identified using a UUID.  See <https://libvirt.org/formatsecret.html> for documentation of the
       XML format used to represent properties of secrets.

       secret-define file
           Create a secret with the properties specified in file, with no associated secret value.  If
           file does not specify a UUID, choose one automatically.  If file specifies a UUID of an
           existing secret, replace its properties by properties defined in file, without affecting
           the secret value.

       secret-dumpxml secret
           Output properties of secret (specified by its UUID) as an XML dump to stdout.

       secret-event {[secret] event [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--timestamp] | --list}
           Wait for a class of secret events to occur, and print appropriate details of events as they
           happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by secret.  Using --list as the only
           argument will provide a list of possible event values known by this client, although the
           connection might not allow registering for all these events.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.   With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event.

       secret-set-value secret base64
           Set the value associated with secret (specified by its UUID) to the value Base64-encoded
           value base64.

       secret-get-value secret
           Output the value associated with secret (specified by its UUID) to stdout, encoded using
           Base64.

       secret-undefine secret
           Delete a secret (specified by its UUID), including the associated value, if any.

       secret-list [--ephemeral] [--no-ephemeral] [--private] [--no-private]
           Returns the list of secrets. You may also want to filter the returned secrets by
           --ephemeral to list the ephemeral ones, --no-ephemeral to list the non-ephemeral ones,
           --private to list the private ones, and --no-private to list the non-private ones.

SNAPSHOT COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate domain snapshots.  Snapshots take the disk, memory, and
       device state of a domain at a point-of-time, and save it for future use.  They have many uses,
       from saving a "clean" copy of an OS image to saving a domain's state before a potentially
       destructive operation.  Snapshots are identified with a unique name.  See
       <https://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html> for documentation of the XML format used to represent
       properties of snapshots.

       snapshot-create domain [xmlfile] {[--redefine [--current]] | [--no-metadata] [--halt]
       [--disk-only] [--reuse-external] [--quiesce] [--atomic] [--live]}
           Create a snapshot for domain domain with the properties specified in xmlfile.  Normally,
           the only properties settable for a domain snapshot are the <name> and <description>
           elements, as well as <disks> if --disk-only is given; the rest of the fields are ignored,
           and automatically filled in by libvirt.  If xmlfile is completely omitted, then libvirt
           will choose a value for all fields.  The new snapshot will become current, as listed by
           snapshot-current.

           If --halt is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state after the snapshot is
           created.

           If --disk-only is specified, the snapshot will only include disk content rather than the
           usual full system snapshot with vm state.  Disk snapshots are captured faster than full
           system snapshots, but reverting to a disk snapshot may require fsck or journal replays,
           since it is like the disk state at the point when the power cord is abruptly pulled; and
           mixing --halt and --disk-only loses any data that was not flushed to disk at the time.

           If --redefine is specified, then all XML elements produced by snapshot-dumpxml are valid;
           this can be used to migrate snapshot hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate
           hierarchy for the case of a transient domain that goes away and is later recreated with the
           same name and UUID, or to make slight alterations in the snapshot metadata (such as host-
           specific aspects of the domain XML embedded in the snapshot).  When this flag is supplied,
           the xmlfile argument is mandatory, and the domain's current snapshot will not be altered
           unless the --current flag is also given.

           If --no-metadata is specified, then the snapshot data is created, but any metadata is
           immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not treat the snapshot as current, and cannot
           revert to the snapshot unless --redefine is later used to teach libvirt about the metadata
           again).

           If --reuse-external is specified, and the snapshot XML requests an external snapshot with a
           destination of an existing file, then the destination must exist and be pre-created with
           correct format and metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused to
           avoid losing contents of the existing files.

           If --quiesce is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent to freeze and unfreeze
           domain's mounted file systems. However, if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation
           will fail.  Currently, this requires --disk-only to be passed as well.

           If --atomic is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot either succeeds, or
           fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support this.  If this flag is not specified,
           then some hypervisors may fail after partially performing the action, and dumpxml must be
           used to see whether any partial changes occurred.

           If --live is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is running. Both disk
           snapshot and domain memory snapshot are taken. This increases the size of the memory image
           of the external snapshot. This is currently supported only for full system external
           snapshots.

           Existence of snapshot metadata will prevent attempts to undefine a persistent domain.
           However, for transient domains, snapshot metadata is silently lost when the domain quits
           running (whether by command such as destroy or by internal guest action).

       snapshot-create-as domain {[--print-xml] | [--no-metadata] [--halt] [--reuse-external]} [name]
       [description] [--disk-only [--quiesce]] [--atomic] [[--live] [--memspec memspec]] [--diskspec]
       diskspec]...
           Create a snapshot for domain domain with the given <name> and <description>; if either
           value is omitted, libvirt will choose a value.  If --print-xml is specified, then XML
           appropriate for snapshot-create is output, rather than actually creating a snapshot.
           Otherwise, if --halt is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state after the
           snapshot is created, and if --disk-only is specified, the snapshot will not include vm
           state.

           The --memspec option can be used to control whether a full system snapshot is internal or
           external.  The --memspec flag is mandatory, followed by a memspec of the form
           [file=]name[,snapshot=type], where type can be no, internal, or external.  To include a
           literal comma in file=name, escape it with a second comma. --memspec cannot be used
           together with --disk-only.

           The --diskspec option can be used to control how --disk-only and external full system
           snapshots create external files.  This option can occur multiple times, according to the
           number of <disk> elements in the domain xml.  Each <diskspec> is in the form
           disk[,snapshot=type][,driver=type][,file=name].  A diskspec must be provided for disks
           backed by block devices as libvirt doesn't auto-generate file names for those.  To include
           a literal comma in disk or in file=name, escape it with a second comma.  A literal
           --diskspec must precede each diskspec unless all three of domain, name, and description are
           also present.  For example, a diskspec of "vda,snapshot=external,file=/path/to,,new"
           results in the following XML:
             <disk name='vda' snapshot='external'>
               <source file='/path/to,new'/>
             </disk>

           If --reuse-external is specified, and the domain XML or diskspec option requests an
           external snapshot with a destination of an existing file, then the destination must exist
           and be pre-created with correct format and metadata. The file is then reused; otherwise, a
           snapshot is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.

           If --quiesce is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent to freeze and unfreeze
           domain's mounted file systems. However, if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation
           will fail.  Currently, this requires --disk-only to be passed as well.

           If --no-metadata is specified, then the snapshot data is created, but any metadata is
           immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not treat the snapshot as current, and cannot
           revert to the snapshot unless snapshot-create is later used to teach libvirt about the
           metadata again).  This flag is incompatible with --print-xml.

           If --atomic is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot either succeeds, or
           fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support this.  If this flag is not specified,
           then some hypervisors may fail after partially performing the action, and dumpxml must be
           used to see whether any partial changes occurred.

           If --live is specified, libvirt takes the snapshot while the guest is running. This
           increases the size of the memory image of the external snapshot. This is currently
           supported only for external full system snapshots.

       snapshot-current domain {[--name] | [--security-info] | [snapshotname]}
           Without snapshotname, this will output the snapshot XML for the domain's current snapshot
           (if any).  If --name is specified, just the current snapshot name instead of the full xml.
           Otherwise, using --security-info will also include security sensitive information in the
           XML.

           With snapshotname, this is a request to make the existing named snapshot become the current
           snapshot, without reverting the domain.

       snapshot-edit domain [snapshotname] [--current] {[--rename] | [--clone]}
           Edit the XML configuration file for snapshotname of a domain.  If both snapshotname and
           --current are specified, also force the edited snapshot to become the current snapshot.  If
           snapshotname is omitted, then --current must be supplied, to edit the current snapshot.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh snapshot-dumpxml dom name > snapshot.xml
            vi snapshot.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh snapshot-create dom snapshot.xml --redefine [--current]

           except that it does some error checking.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

           If --rename is specified, then the edits can change the snapshot name.  If --clone is
           specified, then changing the snapshot name will create a clone of the snapshot metadata.
           If neither is specified, then the edits must not change the snapshot name.  Note that
           changing a snapshot name must be done with care, since the contents of some snapshots, such
           as internal snapshots within a single qcow2 file, are accessible only from the original
           name.

       snapshot-info domain {snapshot | --current}
           Output basic information about a named <snapshot>, or the current snapshot with --current.

       snapshot-list domain [--metadata] [--no-metadata] [{--parent | --roots | [{--tree | --name}]}]
       [--topological] [{[--from] snapshot | --current} [--descendants]] [--leaves] [--no-leaves]
       [--inactive] [--active] [--disk-only] [--internal] [--external]
           List all of the available snapshots for the given domain, defaulting to show columns for
           the snapshot name, creation time, and domain state.

           Normally, table form output is sorted by snapshot name; using --topological instead sorts
           so that no child is listed before its ancestors (although there may be more than one
           possible ordering with this property).

           If --parent is specified, add a column to the output table giving the name of the parent of
           each snapshot.  If --roots is specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots that
           have no parents.  If --tree is specified, the output will be in a tree format, listing just
           snapshot names.  These three options are mutually exclusive. If --name is specified only
           the snapshot name is printed. This option is mutually exclusive with --tree.

           If --from is provided, filter the list to snapshots which are children of the given
           snapshot; or if --current is provided, start at the current snapshot.  When used in
           isolation or with --parent, the list is limited to direct children unless --descendants is
           also present.  When used with --tree, the use of --descendants is implied.  This option is
           not compatible with --roots.  Note that the starting point of --from or --current is not
           included in the list unless the --tree option is also present.

           If --leaves is specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots that have no
           children.  Likewise, if --no-leaves is specified, the list will be filtered to just
           snapshots with children.  (Note that omitting both options does no filtering, while
           providing both options will either produce the same list or error out depending on whether
           the server recognizes the flags).  Filtering options are not compatible with --tree.

           If --metadata is specified, the list will be filtered to just snapshots that involve
           libvirt metadata, and thus would prevent undefine of a persistent domain, or be lost on
           destroy of a transient domain.  Likewise, if --no-metadata is specified, the list will be
           filtered to just snapshots that exist without the need for libvirt metadata.

           If --inactive is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that were taken when the
           domain was shut off.  If --active is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that
           were taken when the domain was running, and where the snapshot includes the memory state to
           revert to that running state.  If --disk-only is specified, the list will be filtered to
           snapshots that were taken when the domain was running, but where the snapshot includes only
           disk state.

           If --internal is specified, the list will be filtered to snapshots that use internal
           storage of existing disk images.  If --external is specified, the list will be filtered to
           snapshots that use external files for disk images or memory state.

       snapshot-dumpxml domain snapshot [--security-info]
           Output the snapshot XML for the domain's snapshot named snapshot.  Using --security-info
           will also include security sensitive information.  Use snapshot-current to easily access
           the XML of the current snapshot.

       snapshot-parent domain {snapshot | --current}
           Output the name of the parent snapshot, if any, for the given snapshot, or for the current
           snapshot with --current.

       snapshot-revert domain {snapshot | --current} [{--running | --paused}] [--force]
           Revert the given domain to the snapshot specified by snapshot, or to the current snapshot
           with --current.  Be aware that this is a destructive action; any changes in the domain
           since the last snapshot was taken will be lost.  Also note that the state of the domain
           after snapshot-revert is complete will be the state of the domain at the time the original
           snapshot was taken.

           Normally, reverting to a snapshot leaves the domain in the state it was at the time the
           snapshot was created, except that a disk snapshot with no vm state leaves the domain in an
           inactive state.  Passing either the --running or --paused flag will perform additional
           state changes (such as booting an inactive domain, or pausing a running domain).  Since
           transient domains cannot be inactive, it is required to use one of these flags when
           reverting to a disk snapshot of a transient domain.

           There are two cases where a snapshot revert involves extra risk, which requires the use of
           --force to proceed.  One is the case of a snapshot that lacks full domain information for
           reverting configuration (such as snapshots created prior to libvirt 0.9.5); since libvirt
           cannot prove that the current configuration matches what was in use at the time of the
           snapshot, supplying --force assures libvirt that the snapshot is compatible with the
           current configuration (and if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run).  The other is
           the case of reverting from a running domain to an active state where a new hypervisor has
           to be created rather than reusing the existing hypervisor, because it implies drawbacks
           such as breaking any existing VNC or Spice connections; this condition happens with an
           active snapshot that uses a provably incompatible configuration, as well as with an
           inactive snapshot that is combined with the --start or --pause flag.

       snapshot-delete domain {snapshot | --current} [--metadata] [{--children | --children-only}]
           Delete the snapshot for the domain named snapshot, or the current snapshot with --current.
           If this snapshot has child snapshots, changes from this snapshot will be merged into the
           children.  If --children is passed, then delete this snapshot and any children of this
           snapshot.  If --children-only is passed, then delete any children of this snapshot, but
           leave this snapshot intact.  These two flags are mutually exclusive.

           If --metadata is specified, then only delete the snapshot metadata maintained by libvirt,
           while leaving the snapshot contents intact for access by external tools; otherwise deleting
           a snapshot also removes the data contents from that point in time.

NWFILTER COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate network filters. Network filters allow filtering of the
       network traffic coming from and going to virtual machines.  Individual network traffic filters
       are written in XML and may contain references to other network filters, describe traffic
       filtering rules, or contain both. Network filters are referenced by virtual machines from
       within their interface description. A network filter may be referenced by multiple virtual
       machines' interfaces.

       nwfilter-define xmlfile
           Make a new network filter known to libvirt. If a network filter with the same name already
           exists, it will be replaced with the new XML.  Any running virtual machine referencing this
           network filter will have its network traffic rules adapted. If for any reason the network
           traffic filtering rules cannot be instantiated by any of the running virtual machines, then
           the new XML will be rejected.

       nwfilter-undefine nwfilter-name
           Delete a network filter. The deletion will fail if any running virtual machine is currently
           using this network filter.

       nwfilter-list
           List all of the available network filters.

       nwfilter-dumpxml nwfilter-name
           Output the network filter XML.

       nwfilter-edit nwfilter-name
           Edit the XML of a network filter.

           This is equivalent to:

            virsh nwfilter-dumpxml myfilter > myfilter.xml
            vi myfilter.xml (or make changes with your other text editor)
            virsh nwfilter-define myfilter.xml

           except that it does some error checking.  The new network filter may be rejected due to the
           same reason as mentioned in nwfilter-define.

           The editor used can be supplied by the $VISUAL or $EDITOR environment variables, and
           defaults to "vi".

NWFILTER BINDING COMMANDS
       The following commands manipulate network filter bindings. Network filter bindings track the
       association between a network port and a network filter. Generally the bindings are managed
       automatically by the hypervisor drivers when adding/removing NICs on a guest.

       If an admin is creating/deleting TAP devices for non-guest usage, however, the network filter
       binding commands provide a way to make use of the network filters directly.

       nwfilter-binding-create xmlfile
           Associate a network port with a network filter. The network filter backend will immediately
           attempt to instantiate the filter rules on the port. This command may be used to associate
           a filter with a currently running guest that does not have a filter defined for a specific
           network port. Since the bindings are generally automatically managed by the hypervisor,
           using this command to define a filter for a network port and then starting the guest
           afterwards may prevent the guest from starting if it attempts to use the network port and
           finds a filter already defined.

       nwfilter-binding-delete port-name
           Disassociate a network port from a network filter. The network filter backend will
           immediately tear down the filter rules that exist on the port. This command may be used to
           remove the network port binding for a filter currently in use for the guest while the guest
           is running without needing to restart the guest. Restoring the network port binding filter
           for the running guest would be accomplished by using nwfilter-binding-create.

       nwfilter-binding-list
           List all of the network ports which have filters associated with them.

       nwfilter-binding-dumpxml port-name
           Output the network filter binding XML for the network device called "port-name".

HYPERVISOR-SPECIFIC COMMANDS
       NOTE: Use of the following commands is strongly discouraged.  They can cause libvirt to become
       confused and do the wrong thing on subsequent operations.  Once you have used these commands,
       please do not report problems to the libvirt developers; the reports will be ignored.  If you
       find that these commands are the only way to accomplish something, then it is better to request
       that the feature be added as a first-class citizen in the regular libvirt library.

       qemu-attach pid
           Attach an externally launched QEMU process to the libvirt QEMU driver.  The QEMU process
           must have been created with a monitor connection using the UNIX driver. Ideally the process
           will also have had the '-name' argument specified.

                $ qemu-kvm -cdrom ~/demo.iso \
                    -monitor unix:/tmp/demo,server,nowait \
                    -name foo \
                    -uuid cece4f9f-dff0-575d-0e8e-01fe380f12ea  &
                $ QEMUPID=$!
                $ virsh qemu-attach $QEMUPID

           Not all functions of libvirt are expected to work reliably after attaching to an externally
           launched QEMU process. There may be issues with the guest ABI changing upon migration and
           device hotplug or hotunplug may not work. The attached environment should be considered
           primarily read-only.

       qemu-monitor-command domain { [--hmp] | [--pretty] } command...
           Send an arbitrary monitor command command to domain domain through the qemu monitor.  The
           results of the command will be printed on stdout.  If --hmp is passed, the command is
           considered to be a human monitor command and libvirt will automatically convert it into QMP
           if needed.  In that case the result will also be converted back from QMP.  If --pretty is
           given, and the monitor uses QMP, then the output will be pretty-printed.  If more than one
           argument is provided for command, they are concatenated with a space in between before
           passing the single command to the monitor.

       qemu-agent-command domain [--timeout seconds | --async | --block] command...
           Send an arbitrary guest agent command command to domain domain through qemu agent.
           --timeout, --async and --block options are exclusive.  --timeout requires timeout seconds
           seconds and it must be positive.  When --aysnc is given, the command waits for timeout
           whether success or failed. And when --block is given, the command waits forever with
           blocking timeout.

       qemu-monitor-event [domain] [--event event-name] [--loop] [--timeout seconds] [--pretty]
       [--regex] [--no-case] [--timestamp]
           Wait for arbitrary QEMU monitor events to occur, and print out the details of events as
           they happen.  The events can optionally be filtered by domain or event-name.  The
           'query-events' QMP command can be used via qemu-monitor-command to learn what events are
           supported.  If --regex is used, event-name is a basic regular expression instead of a
           literal string.  If --no-case is used, event-name will match case-insensitively.

           By default, this command is one-shot, and returns success once an event occurs; you can
           send SIGINT (usually via "Ctrl-C") to quit immediately.  If --timeout is specified, the
           command gives up waiting for events after seconds have elapsed.  With --loop, the command
           prints all events until a timeout or interrupt key.  If --pretty is specified, any JSON
           event details are pretty-printed for better legibility.

           When --timestamp is used, a human-readable timestamp will be printed before the event, and
           the timing information provided by QEMU will be omitted.

       lxc-enter-namespace domain [--noseclabel] -- /path/to/binary [arg1, [arg2, ...]]
           Enter the namespace of domain and execute the command "/path/to/binary" passing the
           requested args. The binary path is relative to the container root filesystem, not the host
           root filesystem. The binary will inherit the environment variables / console visible to
           virsh. The command will be run with the same sVirt context and cgroups placement as
           processes within the container. This command only works when connected to the LXC
           hypervisor driver.  This command succeeds only if "/path/to/binary" has 0 exit status.

           By default the new process will run with the security label of the new parent container.
           Use the --noseclabel option to instead have the process keep the same security label as
           "virsh".

ENVIRONMENT
       The following environment variables can be set to alter the behaviour of "virsh"

       VIRSH_DEBUG=<0 to 4>
           Turn on verbose debugging of virsh commands. Valid levels are

           •   VIRSH_DEBUG=0

               DEBUG - Messages at ALL levels get logged

           •   VIRSH_DEBUG=1

               INFO - Logs messages at levels INFO, NOTICE, WARNING and ERROR

           •   VIRSH_DEBUG=2

               NOTICE - Logs messages at levels NOTICE, WARNING and ERROR

           •   VIRSH_DEBUG=3

               WARNING - Logs messages at levels WARNING and ERROR

           •   VIRSH_DEBUG=4

               ERROR - Messages at only ERROR level gets logged.

       VIRSH_LOG_FILE="LOGFILE"
           The file to log virsh debug messages.

       VIRSH_DEFAULT_CONNECT_URI
           The hypervisor to connect to by default. Set this to a URI, in the same format as accepted
           by the connect option. This environment variable is deprecated in favour of the global
           LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI variable which serves the same purpose.

       LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI
           The hypervisor to connect to by default. Set this to a URI, in the same format as accepted
           by the connect option. This overrides the default URI set in any client config file and
           prevents libvirt from probing for drivers.

       VISUAL
           The editor to use by the edit and related options.

       EDITOR
           The editor to use by the edit and related options, if "VISUAL" is not set.

       VIRSH_HISTSIZE
           The number of commands to remember in the command  history.  The default value is 500.

       LIBVIRT_DEBUG=LEVEL
           Turn on verbose debugging of all libvirt API calls. Valid levels are

           •   LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1

               Messages at level DEBUG or above

           •   LIBVIRT_DEBUG=2

               Messages at level INFO or above

           •   LIBVIRT_DEBUG=3

               Messages at level WARNING or above

           •   LIBVIRT_DEBUG=4

               Messages at level ERROR
