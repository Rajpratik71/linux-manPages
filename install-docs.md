DESCRIPTION
       install-docs is a tool allow Debian package maintainers to register documentation to various documentation systems.  It currently supports dhelp,  dwww, doc-central, and scrollkeeper browsers.

       This manual page provides a quick synopsis of install-docs usage.  Full documentation can be found in the documentation, including a description of the control file syntax and grammar.

OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
           Operate verbosely.

       -d, --debug
           Print some debugging information.

       --no-update-menus
           Inhibit running dwww-build-menu(8), dhelp_parse(8), and scrollkeeper-update(8).

       --rootdir dir
           Set the root directory to dir instead of `/'. Useful and valid only with the --check action.

ACTIONS
       Below is list of possible actions install-docs could handle. There can be only one action option passed to install-docs, moreover the action with its arguments must be the last option passed.

       Each file argument should be the full path for the doc-base control file (i.e.  `/usr/share/doc-base/some_file' or `/etc/doc-base/documents/some_file'), and each docid should be the document
       identifier (Document identifiers are set in the `Document' field of the control file, and usually correspond to the package name.)

       If file or docid equals `-' (the minus sign), the list of arguments is read from the standard input (each file name or document id in separate line).

       -i file [file ...],  --install file [file ...]
           Install the documentation described by the control file file.

       -r file [file ...],  --remove file [file ...]
           Remove the documentation identified by the control file file.

       -c file [file ...],  --check file [file ...]
           Check the control file file and display number of possible problems found.  Use with --verbose to get the actual locations of errors and warnings.  If --rootdir was also given, its argument
           will be prepended to names of the files given if the `Files' and `Index' fields of the file.

       -R,  --remove-all
           De-register all registered documents.

       -I, --install-all
           (Re)register all documents from /usr/share/doc-base and /etc/doc-base/documents.

       -C, --install-changed
           Compare contents of /usr/share/doc-base and /etc/doc-base/documents directories with registered documents database and de-register any files that are missing and (re)register only changed or
           new files.

       -s docid [docid ...], --status docid [docid ...]
           Display the status of the document identifier docid.

       -L docid [docid ...], --listfiles docid [docid ...]
           Deprecated option. Does nothing.

       --dump-db dbname
           Dumps contents of internal databases, for debugging purposes. dbname can be either files.db or status.db.

       -h, --help
           Show a short help message.

       -V, --version
           Display version information.
