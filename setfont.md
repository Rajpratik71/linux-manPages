SETFONT(8)                               International Support                              SETFONT(8)

NAME
       setfont - load EGA/VGA console screen font

SYNOPSIS
       setfont  [-O font+umap.orig] [-o font.orig] [-om cmap.orig] [-ou umap.orig] [-N] [font.new ...]
       [-m cmap] [-u umap] [-C console] [-hH] [-v] [-V]

DESCRIPTION
       The setfont command reads a font from the file font.new and loads it into the EGA/VGA character
       generator,  and  optionally outputs the previous font.  It can also load various mapping tables
       and output the previous versions.

       If no args are given (or only the option -N for some number N), then a default  (8xN)  font  is
       loaded (see below).  One may give several small fonts, all containing a Unicode table, and set‐
       font will combine them and load the union.  Typical use:

       setfont
              Load a default font.

       setfont drdos8x16
              Load a given font (here the 448-glyph drdos font).

       setfont cybercafe -u cybercafe
              Load a given font that does not have a Unicode map and provide one explicitly.

       setfont LatArCyrHeb-19 -m 8859-2
              Load a given font (here a 512-glyph font combining several character sets) and  indicate
              that one's local character set is ISO 8859-2.

       Note:  if  a font has more than 256 glyphs, only 8 out of 16 colors can be used simultaneously.
       It can make console perception worse (loss of intensity and even some colors).

FONT FORMATS
       The standard Linux font format is the PSF font.  It has a  header  describing  font  properties
       like  character  size,  followed by the glyph bitmaps, optionally followed by a Unicode mapping
       table giving the Unicode value for each glyph.  Several other (obsolete) font formats are  rec‐
       ognized.   If  the input file has code page format (probably with suffix .cp), containing three
       fonts with sizes e.g. 8x8, 8x14 and 8x16, then one of the options -8 or -14 or -16 must be used
       to  select one.  Raw font files are binary files of size 256*N bytes, containing bit images for
       each of 256 characters, one byte per scan line, and N bytes per character (0 < N <= 32).   Most
       fonts have a width of 8 bits, but with the framebuffer device (fb) other widths can be used.

FONT HEIGHT
       The  program  setfont has no built-in knowledge of VGA video modes, but just asks the kernel to
       load the character ROM of the video card with certain bitmaps. However, since Linux  1.3.1  the
       kernel  knows enough about EGA/VGA video modes to select a different line distance. The default
       character height will be the number N inferred from the font or specified by  option.  However,
       the user can specify a different character height H using the -h option.

CONSOLE MAPS
       Several  mappings  are involved in the path from user program output to console display. If the
       console is in utf8 mode (see unicode_start(1)) then the kernel expects that user program output
       is  coded  as UTF-8 (see utf-8(7)), and converts that to Unicode (ucs2).  Otherwise, a transla‐
       tion table is used from the 8-bit program output to 16-bit Unicode values. Such  a  translation
       table  is  called  a Unicode console map.  There are four of them: three built into the kernel,
       the fourth settable using the -m option of setfont.  An escape sequence chooses  between  these
       four  tables;  after loading a cmap, setfont will output the escape sequence Esc ( K that makes
       it the active translation.

       Suitable arguments for the -m option are for example 8859-1, 8859-2, ..., 8859-15, cp437,  ...,
       cp1250.

       Given  the Unicode value of the symbol to be displayed, the kernel finds the right glyph in the
       font using the Unicode mapping info of the font and displays it.

       Old fonts do not have Unicode mapping info, and in order to handle them  there  are  direct-to-
       font  maps  (also loaded using -m) that give a correspondence between user bytes and font posi‐
       tions.  The most common correspondence is the one given in the file trivial  (where  user  byte
       values  are  used  directly as font positions).  Other correspondences are sometimes preferable
       since the PC video hardware expects line drawing characters in certain font positions.

       Giving a -m none argument inhibits the loading and activation of a mapping table.  The previous
       console  map can be saved to a file using the -om file option.  These options of setfont render
       mapscrn(8) obsolete. (However, it may be useful to read that man page.)

UNICODE FONT MAPS
       The correspondence between the glyphs in the font and Unicode values is described by a  Unicode
       mapping  table.   Many fonts have a Unicode mapping table included in the font file, and an ex‐
       plicit table can be indicated using the -u option. The program setfont will load such a Unicode
       mapping  table,  unless a -u none argument is given. The previous Unicode mapping table will be
       saved as part of the saved font file when the -O option is used. It can be saved to a  separate
       file using the -ou file option.  These options of setfont render loadunimap(8) obsolete.

       The  Unicode  mapping  table  should assign some glyph to the `missing character' value U+fffd,
       otherwise missing characters are not translated, giving a usually very confusing result.

       Usually no mapping table is needed, and a Unicode mapping table is  already  contained  in  the
       font  (sometimes  this  is indicated by the .psfu extension), so that most users need not worry
       about the precise meaning and functioning of these mapping tables.

       One may add a Unicode mapping table to a psf font using psfaddtable(1).

OPTIONS
       -h H   Override font height.

       -m file
              Load console map or Unicode console map from file.

       -o file
              Save previous font in file.

       -O file
              Save previous font and Unicode map in file.

       -om file
              Store console map in file.

       -ou file
              Save previous Unicode map in file.

       -u file
              Load Unicode table describing the font from file.

       -C console
              Set the font for the indicated console. (May require root permissions.)

       -v     Be verbose.

       -V     Print version and exit.

NOTE
       PC video hardware allows one to use the "intensity" bit either to indicate  brightness,  or  to
       address  512 (instead of 256) glyphs in the font. So, if the font has more than 256 glyphs, the
       console will be reduced to 8 (instead of 16) colors.

FILES
       /usr/share/consolefonts is the default font directory.  /usr/share/unimaps is the  default  di‐
       rectory  for  Unicode  maps.   /usr/share/consoletrans is the default directory for screen map‐
       pings.  The default font is a file default (or default8xN if the -N option was given  for  some
       number N) perhaps with suitable extension (like .psf).
