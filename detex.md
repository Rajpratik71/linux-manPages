NAME
       detex - a filter to strip TeX commands from a .tex file.

SYNOPSIS
       detex [ -clnstw ] [ -e environment-list ] [ filename[.tex] ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Detex (Version 2.8.3) reads each file in sequence, removes all comments and TeX control sequences and writes the remainder on the standard output.  All text in math mode and dis‚Äê
       play mode is removed.  By default, detex follows \input commands.  If a file cannot be opened, a warning message is printed and the command is ignored.  If the -n option is used,
       no \input or \include commands will be processed.  This allows single file processing.  If no input file is given on the command line, detex reads from standard input.

       If  the  magic  sequence  ``\begin{document}'' appears in the text, detex assumes it is dealing with LaTeX source and detex recognizes additional constructs used in LaTeX.  These
       include the \include and \includeonly commands.  The -l option can be used to force LaTeX mode and the -t option can be used to force TeX mode regardless of input content.

       Text in various environment modes of LaTeX is ignored.  The default modes are array, eqnarray, equation, longtable, picture, tabular and verbatim.  The -e option can be  used  to
       specify  a  comma  separated  environment-list  of  environments  to  ignore.  The list replaces the defaults so specifying an empty list effectively causes no environments to be
       ignored.

       The -c option can be used in LaTeX mode to have detex echo the arguments to \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros.  This can be useful when sending the output to a style checker.

       Detex assumes the standard character classes are being used for TeX.  Detex allows white space between control sequences and magic characters like  `{'  when  recognizing  things
       like LaTeX environments.

       The -r option tries to naively replace $..$, $$..$$,  and with nouns and verbs (in particular, "noun" and "verbs") in a way that keeps sentences readable.

       If the -w flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of two or more letters and apostrophes beginning with a letter) per line, and all other characters ignored.
       Without -w the output follows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.  Newline characters are preserved where possible so that the lines of output match  the  input  as
       closely as possible.

       The  TEXINPUTS  environment  variable is used to find \input and \include files.  Like TeX, it interprets a leading or trailing `:' as the default TEXINPUTS.  It does not support
       the `//' directory expansion magic sequence.

       Detex now handles the basic TeX ligatures as a special case, replacing the ligatures with acceptable charater substitutes.  This eliminates spelling errors introduced  by  merely
       removing  them.   The  ligatures  are  \aa,  \ae,  \oe, \ss, \o, \l (and their upper-case equivalents).  The special "dotless" characters \i and \j are also replaced with i and j
       respectively.

       Note that previous versions of detex would replace control sequences with a space character to prevent words from running together.  However, this caused accents in the middle of
       words  to  break  words, generating "spelling errors" that were not desirable.  Therefore, the new version merely removes these accents.  The old functionality can be essentially
       duplicated by using the -s option.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Nesting of \input is allowed but the number of opened files must not exceed the system's limit on the number of simultaneously opened files.  Detex  ignores  unrecognized  option
       characters after printing a warning message.

BUGS
       Detex is not a complete TeX interpreter, so it can be confused by some constructs.  Most errors result in too much rather than too little output.

       Running LaTeX source without a ``\begin{document}'' through detex may produce errors.

       Suggestions for improvements are (mildly) encouraged.
