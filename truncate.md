NAME
       truncate - shrink or extend the size of a file to the specified size

SYNOPSIS
       truncate OPTION... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

       If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.  If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the extended part (hole) reads as zero bytes.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -o, --io-blocks
              treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes

       -r, --reference=RFILE
              base size on RFILE

       -s, --size=SIZE
              set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

       SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying characters: '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least, '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.
