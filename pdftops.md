NAME
       pdftops - Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter (ver‐
       sion 3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftops [options] <PDF-file> [<PS-file>]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript so
       they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the  PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a PostScript file,
       PS-file.  If PS-file is not specified, pdftops  converts  file.pdf  to
       file.ps  (or  file.eps  with the -eps option).  If PS-file is ´-', the
       PostScript is sent to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -level1
              Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The  resulting  PostScript  files
              will be significantly larger (if they contain images), but will
              print on Level 1 printers.  This also converts  all  images  to
              black  and  white.   No  more  than one of the PostScript level
              options (-level1,  -level1sep,  -level2,  -level2sep,  -level3,
              -level3sep) may be given.

       -level1sep
              Generate  Level  1  separable  PostScript.  All colors are con‐
              verted to CMYK.  Images are written with separate  stream  data
              for the four components.

       -level2
              Generate Level 2 PostScript.  Level 2 supports color images and
              image compression.  This is the default setting.

       -level2sep
              Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.   All  colors  are  con‐
              verted to CMYK.  The PostScript separation convention operators
              are used to handle custom (spot) colors.

       -level3
              Generate Level 3 PostScript.  This enables all Level 2 features
              plus CID font embedding.

       -level3sep
              Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separation handling
              is the same as for -level2sep.

       -eps   Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.   An  EPS  file
              contains  a  single  image,  so  if  you use this option with a
              multi-page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to specify a single
              page.   No  more than one of the mode options (-eps, -form) may
              be given.

       -form  Generate a PostScript form which can be  imported  by  software
              that  understands  forms.  A form contains a single page, so if
              you use this option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f
              and  -l to specify a single page.  The -level1 option cannot be
              used with -form.  No more than one of the mode  options  (-eps,
              -form) may be given.

       -opi   Generate  OPI  comments for all images and forms which have OPI
              information.  (This option is only  available  if  pdftops  was
              compiled with OPI support.)

       -binary
              Write  binary  data in Level 1 PostScript.  By default, pdftops
              writes hex-encoded data in Level 1 PostScript.  Binary data  is
              non-standard  in  Level  1 PostScript but reduces the file size
              and can be useful when Level 1 PostScript is required only  for
              its restricted use of PostScript operators.

       -r number
              Set  the  resolution in DPI when pdftops rasterizes images with
              transparencies or, for Level 1 PostScript, when pdftops raster‐
              izes  images  with color masks.  By default, pdftops rasterizes
              images to 300 DPI.

       -noembt1
              By default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in the PDF file
              are  copied  into  the  PostScript  file.   This  option causes
              pdftops to substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts  make
              PostScript files larger, but may be necessary for readable out‐
              put.

       -noembtt
              By default, any TrueType fonts which are embedded  in  the  PDF
              file  are  copied into the PostScript file.  This option causes
              pdftops to substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts  make
              PostScript files larger, but may be necessary for readable out‐
              put.  Also, some PostScript interpreters do not  have  TrueType
              rasterizers.

       -noembcidps
              By  default, any CID PostScript fonts which are embedded in the
              PDF file are copied into the PostScript file.  This option dis‐
              ables  that  embedding.   No  attempt is made to substitute for
              non-embedded CID PostScript fonts.

       -noembcidtt
              By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are  embedded  in  the
              PDF file are copied into the PostScript file.  This option dis‐
              ables that embedding.  No attempt is  made  to  substitute  for
              non-embedded CID TrueType fonts.

       -passfonts
              By  default,  references to non-embedded 8-bit fonts in the PDF
              file are substituted  with  the  closest  "Helvetica",  "Times-
              Roman",  or  "Courier"  font.  This option passes references to
              non-embedded fonts through to the PostScript file.

       -aaRaster yes | no
              Enable or disable raster anti-aliasing.  This defaults to "no".
              pdftops  may need to rasterize transparencies and pattern image
              masks in the PDF.  If the PostScript  will  be  printed,  leave
              -aaRaster disabled and set -r to the resolution of the printer.
              If the PostScript will be viewed, enabling -aaRaster  may  make
              rasterized text easier to read.

       -optimizecolorspace
              By default, bitmap images in the PDF pass through to the output
              PostScript in their original color space, which  produces  pre‐
              dictable  results.   This  option  converts RGB and CMYK images
              into Gray images if every pixel of the image has  equal  compo‐
              nents.   This  can fix problems when doing color separations of
              PDFs that contain embedded black and white  images  encoded  as
              RGB.

       -preload
              preload images and forms

       -paper size
              Set  the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".
              This can also be set to "match", which will set the paper  size
              of  each  page  to match the size specified in the PDF file. If
              none the -paper, -paperw, or -paperh options are specified  the
              default is to match the paper size.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points.

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height, in points.

       -origpagesizes
              This option is the same as "-paper match".

       -nocrop
              By  default,  output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the
              PDF file.  This option disables cropping.

       -expand
              Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper.   By
              default, these pages are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don't  scale  PDF  pages  which  are larger than the paper.  By
              default, pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after  any  scal‐
              ing)  are centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be
              aligned to the lower-left corner of the paper instead.

       -duplex
              Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in the PostScript  file.   This
              tells duplex-capable printers to enable duplexing.

       -opw password
              Specify  the  owner  password for the PDF file.  Providing this
              will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -overprint
              Enable overprinting.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
