NAME
       sessreg - manage utmpx/wtmpx entries for non-init clients

SYNOPSIS
       sessreg  [-w  wtmpx-file]  [-u utmpx-file] [-L lastlog-file] [-l line-
       name] [-h host-name] [-s slot-number]  [-x  Xservers-file]  [-t  ttys-
       file] [-V] [-a] [-d] user-name

DESCRIPTION
       Sessreg  is  a  simple  program  for  managing utmpx/wtmpx and lastlog
       entries for xdm sessions.

       This version of sessreg is built using the modern POSIX pututxline(3c)
       interfaces,  which  no  longer  require the slot-number, ttys-file, or
       Xservers-file mappings.  For compatibility  with  older  versions  and
       other  operating  systems,  the -s, -t, and -x flags are accepted, but
       ignored.

USAGE
       In Xstartup, place a call like:

              sessreg -a -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $USER

       and in Xreset:

              sessreg -d -l $DISPLAY -x /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers $USER

OPTIONS
       -w wtmpx-file
              This  specifies   an   alternate   wtmpx   file,   instead   of
              /var/log/wtmp.    The  special  name  "none"  disables  writing
              records to the wtmpx file.

       -u utmpx-file
              This  specifies   an   alternate   utmpx   file,   instead   of
              /var/run/utmp.    The  special  name  "none"  disables  writing
              records to the utmpx file.

       -L lastlog-file
              This  specifies  an  alternate   lastlog   file,   instead   of
              /var/log/lastlog,  if the platform supports lastlog files.  The
              special name "none" disables writing  records  to  the  lastlog
              file.

       -l line-name
              This describes the "line" name of the entry.  For terminal ses‐
              sions, this is the  final  pathname  segment  of  the  terminal
              device filename (e.g. ttyd0).  For X sessions, it should proba‐
              bly be the local display name given to the users session  (e.g.
              :0).   If  none  is specified, the terminal name will be deter‐
              mined with ttyname(3) and stripped of leading components.

       -h host-name
              This is set to indicate that the session was initiated  from  a
              remote host.  In typical xdm usage, this options is not used.

       -s slot-number
              This  option is accepted for compatibility, but does nothing in
              this version of sessreg.

       -x Xservers-file
              This option is accepted for compatibility, but does nothing  in
              this version of sessreg.

       -t ttys-file
              This  option is accepted for compatibility, but does nothing in
              this version of sessreg.

       -V     This option causes the command to print its version and exit.

       -a     This session should be added to utmpx/wtmpx.

       -d     This session should be deleted from utmpx/wtmpx.  One of  -a/-d
              must be specified.
