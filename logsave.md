LOGSAVE(8)                 System Manager's Manual                 LOGSAVE(8)

NAME
       logsave - save the output of a command in a logfile

SYNOPSIS
       logsave [ -asv ] logfile cmd_prog [ ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  logsave  program  will  execute cmd_prog with the specified argu‐
       ment(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the  containing
       directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will accumulate the out‐
       put in memory until it can be written out.  A copy of the output  will
       also be written to standard output.

       If cmd_prog is a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a pro‐
       gram, logsave will take its input from standard input and save  it  in
       logfile

       logsave  is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts until
       the /var partition is  mounted,  so  the  output  can  be  written  to
       /var/log.

OPTIONS
       -a     This  option  will  cause the output to be appended to logfile,
              instead of replacing its current contents.

       -s     This option will cause logsave to skip writing to the log  file
              text which is bracketed with a control-A (ASCII 001 or Start of
              Header) and control-B (ASCII  002  or  Start  of  Text).   This
              allows  progress  bar  information to be visible to the user on
              the console, while not being written to the log file.

       -v     This option will make logsave to be more verbose in its  output
              to the user.
