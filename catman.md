CATMAN(8)                     Manual pager utils                    CATMAN(8)

NAME
       catman - create or update the pre-formatted manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       catman [-d?V] [-M path] [-C file] [section] ...

DESCRIPTION
       catman  is  used  to  create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual
       pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much faster to dis‐
       play  than the original manual pages, but require extra storage space.
       The decision to support cat pages is that of the local  administrator,
       who must provide suitable directories to contain them.

       The  options  available  to catman are the manual page hierarchies and
       sections to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are  those  specified
       as  system  hierarchies  in  the  man-db  configuration  file, and the
       default sections are either the colon-delimited contents of the  envi‐
       ronment  variable  $MANSECT  or  the standard set compiled into man if
       $MANSECT is undefined.  Supplying catman with  a  set  of  whitespace-
       delimited section names will override both of the above.

       catman  makes  use  of  the  index database cache associated with each
       hierarchy to determine which files need to be formatted.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an  alternate  colon-delimited  manual  page  hierarchy
              search path.  By default, this is all paths indicated as system
              hierarchies in the man-db configuration file.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather  than  the  default  of
              ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sec‐
              tions and it is used to  determine  which  manual  sections  to
              search  and  in what order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix
              3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7",  unless  overridden  by  the  SECTION
              directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPATH
              If  $MANPATH  is  set,  its  value is interpreted as the colon-
              delimited manual page hierarchy search path to use.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              A traditional global index database cache.

       /var/catman/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An alternate or FSSTND compliant global index database cache.
