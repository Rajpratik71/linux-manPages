NAME
       lkbib - search bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
       lkbib [ -v ] [ -ifields ] [ -pfilename ] [ -tn ] key...

DESCRIPTION
       lkbib  searches bibliographic databases for references that contain the keys key... and prints any references found on the standard output.
       lkbib will search any databases given by -p options, and then a default database.  The default database is taken from the REFER environment
       variable  if it is set, otherwise it is /usr/dict/papers/Ind.  For each database filename to be searched, if an index filename.i created by
       indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.

OPTIONS
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its parameter.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -pfilename
              Search filename.  Multiple -p options can be used.

       -istring
              When searching files for which no index exists, ignore the contents of fields whose names are in string.

       -tn    Only require the first n characters of keys to be given.  Initially n is 6.

ENVIRONMENT
       REFER  Default database.

FILES
       /usr/dict/papers/Ind  Default database to be used if the REFER environment variable is not set.

       filename.i            Index files.
