NAME
       msgexec - process translations of message catalog

SYNOPSIS
       msgexec [OPTION] COMMAND [COMMAND-OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  command to all translations of a translation catalog.  The
       COMMAND can be any program that  reads  a  translation  from  standard
       input.   It  is invoked once for each translation.  Its output becomes
       msgexec's output.  msgexec's return code is the  maximum  return  code
       across all invocations.

       A special builtin command called '0' outputs the translation, followed
       by a null byte.  The output of "msgexec 0" is suitable  as  input  for
       "xargs -0".

   Command input:
       --newline
              add newline at the end of input

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long options are mandatory for short options
       too.

   Input file location:
       -i, --input=INPUTFILE
              input PO file

       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
              add DIRECTORY to list for input files search

       If no input file is given or if it is -, standard input is read.

   Input file syntax:
       -P, --properties-input
              input file is in Java .properties syntax

       --stringtable-input
              input file is in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings syntax

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
