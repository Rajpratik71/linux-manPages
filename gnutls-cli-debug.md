NAME
       gnutls-cli-debug - GnuTLS debug client

SYNOPSIS
       gnutls-cli-debug [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       Operands and options may be intermixed.  They will be reordered.


DESCRIPTION
       TLS  debug  client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to a server and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capa‚Äê
       bilities.  It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's capabilities. If called with the `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.  Can be used to check  for  servers  with
       special needs or bugs.

OPTIONS
       -d number, --debug=number
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       -V, --verbose
              More verbose output.  This option may appear an unlimited number of times.


       -p number, --port=number
              The port to connect to.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 65536


       --app-proto=string
              The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap).


       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       -v [{v|c|n --version [{v|c|n}]}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.
