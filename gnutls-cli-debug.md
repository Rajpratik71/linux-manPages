NAME
       gnutls-cli-debug - GnuTLS debug client

SYNOPSIS
       gnutls-cli-debug [-flags] [-flag [value]] [--option-name[[=| ]value]]

       Operands and options may be intermixed.  They will be reordered.

DESCRIPTION
       TLS  debug  client.  It  sets  up  multiple TLS connections to a server and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging
       GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.  It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the  server's
       capabilities.  If  called  with  the  `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.  Can be used to check for servers with special needs or
       bugs.

OPTIONS
       -d number, --debug=number
              Enable debugging.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 9999

              Specifies the debug level.

       -V, --verbose
              More verbose output.  This option may appear an unlimited number of times.

       -p number, --port=number
              The port to connect to.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 65536

       --app-proto
              This is an alias for the --starttls-proto option.

       --starttls-proto=string
              The application protocol to be used to obtain the server's certificate (https, ftp, smtp, imap, ldap, xmpp).

              Specify the application layer protocol for STARTTLS. If the protocol is supported, gnutls-cli will proceed to the TLS negotiation.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       -v [{v|c|n --version [{v|c|n}]}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and
              `n' will print the full copyright notice.
