NAME
       ikiwiki-comment - posts a comment

SYNOPSIS
       ikiwiki-comment page.mdwn

DESCRIPTION
       ikiwiki-comment creates a comment for the specified wiki page file, and opens your editor to edit it.

       Once  you're  done,  it's  up  to you to add the comment to whatever version control system is being used by the wiki, and do any necessary
       pushing to publish it.

       Note that since ikiwiki-comment is not passed the configuration of the wiki it's acting on, it doesn't know what types of markup are avail‚Äê
       able. Instead, it always removes one level of extensions from the file, so when run on a page.mdwn file, it puts the comment in page/

       The  username  field  is set to the unix account name you're using.  You may want to edit it to match the username you use elsewhere on the
       wiki.
