SULOGIN(8)                  System Administration                  SULOGIN(8)

NAME
       sulogin - single-user login

SYNOPSIS
       sulogin [options] [tty]

DESCRIPTION
       sulogin is invoked by init when the system goes into single-user mode.

       The user is prompted:

            Give root password for system maintenance
            (or type Control-D for normal startup):

       If the root account is locked and --force is specified, no password is
       required.

       sulogin will be connected to the current terminal, or to the  optional
       tty  device  that  can  be  specified  on  the command line (typically
       /dev/console).

       When the user exits from the single-user shell, or  presses  control-D
       at the prompt, the system will continue to boot.

OPTIONS
       -e, --force
              If  the  default method of obtaining the root password from the
              system via getpwnam(3)  fails,  then  examine  /etc/passwd  and
              /etc/shadow to get the password.  If these files are damaged or
              nonexistent, or when root account is locked by '!'  or  '*'  at
              the  begin of the password then sulogin will start a root shell
              without asking for a password.

              Only use the -e option if you are sure the  console  is  physi‐
              cally protected against unauthorized access.

       -p, --login-shell
              Specifying  this  option  causes  sulogin  to  start  the shell
              process as a login shell.

       -t, --timeout seconds
              Specify the maximum amount of time to wait for user input.   By
              default, sulogin will wait forever.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       sulogin  looks  for  the  environment  variable  SUSHELL or sushell to
       determine what shell to start.  If the  environment  variable  is  not
       set,  it  will  try to execute root's shell from /etc/passwd.  If that
       fails, it will fall back to /bin/sh.
