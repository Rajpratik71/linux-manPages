NAME
       lxc-attach - start a process inside a running container.

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-attach {-n, --name name} [-f, --rcfile config_file] [-a, --arch arch] [-e, --elevated-
                  privileges privileges] [-s, --namespaces namespaces] [-R, --remount-sys-proc]
                  [--keep-env] [--clear-env] [-v, --set-var variable] [--keep-var variable] [--
                  command]

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-attach runs the specified command inside the container specified by  name.  The  container
       has to be running already.

       If  no  command is specified, the current default shell of the user running lxc-attach will be
       looked up inside the container and executed. This will fail if no such user exists inside  the
       container or the container does not have a working nsswitch mechanism.

       Previous versions of lxc-attach simply attached to the specified namespaces of a container and
       ran a shell or the specified command without first allocating a  pseudo  terminal.  This  made
       them vulnerable to input faking via a TIOCSTI ioctl call after switching between userspace ex‐
       ecution contexts with different privilege levels. Newer versions of lxc-attach will try to al‐
       locate  a  pseudo  terminal  file descriptor pair on the host and attach any standard file de‐
       scriptors which refer to a terminal to the container side of the pseudo terminal  before  exe‐
       cuting a shell or command. Note, that if none of the standard file descriptors refer to a ter‐
       minal lxc-attach will not try to allocate a pseudo terminal. Instead it will simply attach  to
       the containers namespaces and run a shell or the specified command.

OPTIONS
       -f, --rcfile config_file
              Specify  the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation function‐
              alities for the container.

              This configuration file if present will be used even if there is already  a  configura‐
              tion file present in the previously created container (via lxc-create).

       -a, --arch arch
              Specify the architecture which the kernel should appear to be running as to the command
              executed. This option will accept the same settings as the lxc.arch option in container
              configuration  files, see lxc.conf(5). By default, the current architecture of the run‐
              ning container will be used.

       -e, --elevated-privileges privileges
              Do not drop privileges when running command inside the container.  If  this  option  is
              specified,  the  new process will not be added to the container's cgroup(s) and it will
              not drop its capabilities before executing.

              You may specify privileges, in case you do not want to elevate all of them, as a  pipe-
              separated  list,  e.g.  CGROUP|LSM. Allowed values are CGROUP, CAP and LSM representing
              cgroup, capabilities and restriction privileges respectively. (The pipe symbol needs to
              be escaped, e.g. CGROUP\|LSM or quoted, e.g.  "CGROUP|LSM".)

              Warning: This may leak privileges into the container if the command starts subprocesses
              that remain active after  the  main  process  that  was  attached  is  terminated.  The
              (re-)starting  of daemons inside the container is problematic, especially if the daemon
              starts a lot of subprocesses such as cron or sshd.  Use with great care.

       -s, --namespaces namespaces
              Specify the namespaces to attach to, as a pipe-separated list,  e.g.  NETWORK|IPC.  Al‐
              lowed  values are MOUNT, PID, UTSNAME, IPC, USER and NETWORK. This allows one to change
              the context of the process to e.g. the network namespace of the container while retain‐
              ing  the  other  namespaces as those of the host. (The pipe symbol needs to be escaped,
              e.g.  MOUNT\|PID or quoted, e.g.  "MOUNT|PID".)

              Important: This option implies -e.

       -R, --remount-sys-proc
              When using -s and the mount namespace is not included, this flag will cause  lxc-attach
              to remount /proc and /sys to reflect the current other namespace contexts.

              Please see the Notes section for more details.

              This option will be ignored if one tries to attach to the mount namespace anyway.

       --keep-env
              Keep  the current environment for attached programs. This is the current default behav‐
              iour (as of version 0.9), but is is likely to change in the future, since this may leak
              undesirable information into the container. If you rely on the environment being avail‐
              able for the attached program, please use this option to be future-proof.  In  addition
              to current environment variables, container=lxc will be set.

       --clear-env
              Clear the environment before attaching, so no undesired environment variables leak into
              the container. The variable container=lxc will be the only environment with  which  the
              attached program starts.

       -v, --set-var variable
              Set an additional environment variable that is seen by the attached program in the con‐
              tainer. It is specified in the form of  "VAR=VALUE",  and  can  be  specified  multiple
              times.

       --keep-var variable
              Keep  a  specified  environment  variable. It can only be specified in conjunction with
              --clear-env, and can be specified multiple times.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to most of lxc commands.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       --usage
              Give the usage message

       -q, --quiet
              mute on

       -P, --lxcpath=PATH
              Use an alternate container path. The default is /var/lib/lxc.

       -o, --logfile=FILE
              Output to an alternate log FILE. The default is no log.

       -l, --logpriority=LEVEL
              Set log priority to LEVEL. The default log priority is ERROR. Possible values are : FA‐
              TAL, CRIT, WARN, ERROR, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG.

              Note  that  this  option is setting the priority of the events log in the alternate log
              file. It do not have effect on the ERROR events log on stderr.

       -n, --name=NAME
              Use container identifier NAME.  The container  identifier  format  is  an  alphanumeric
              string.

       --rcfile=FILE
              Specify  the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation function‐
              alities for the container.

              This configuration file if present will be used even if there is already  a  configura‐
              tion file present in the previously created container (via lxc-create).

       --version
              Show the version number.

EXAMPLES
       To spawn a new shell running inside an existing container, use

                 lxc-attach -n container

       To restart the cron service of a running Debian container, use

                 lxc-attach -n container -- /etc/init.d/cron restart

       To  deactivate  the  network link eth1 of a running container that does not have the NET_ADMIN
       capability, use either the -e option to use increased capabilities, assuming the  ip  tool  is
       installed:

                 lxc-attach -n container -e -- /sbin/ip link delete eth1

       Or, alternatively, use the -s to use the tools installed on the host outside the container:

                 lxc-attach -n container -s NETWORK -- /sbin/ip link delete eth1

COMPATIBILITY
       Attaching completely (including the pid and mount namespaces) to a container requires a kernel
       of version 3.8 or higher, or a patched kernel, please see the lxc website for details. lxc-at‐
       tach will fail in that case if used with an unpatched kernel of version 3.7 and prior.

       Nevertheless, it will succeed on an unpatched kernel of version 3.0 or higher if the -s option
       is used to restrict the namespaces that the process is to be attached to to  one  or  more  of
       NETWORK, IPC and UTSNAME.

       Attaching  to  user  namespaces is supported by kernel 3.8 or higher with enabling user names‐
       pace.

NOTES
       The Linux /proc and /sys filesystems contain information about some quantities  that  are  af‐
       fected  by namespaces, such as the directories named after process ids in /proc or the network
       interface information in /sys/class/net. The namespace of the  process  mounting  the  pseudo-
       filesystems  determines  what information is shown, not the namespace of the process accessing
       /proc or /sys.

       If one uses the -s option to only attach to the pid namespace of  a  container,  but  not  its
       mount namespace (which will contain the /proc of the container and not the host), the contents
       of /proc will reflect that of the host and not the container. Analogously, the same issue  oc‐
       curs when reading the contents of /sys/class/net and attaching to just the network namespace.

       To  work around this problem, the -R flag provides the option to remount /proc and /sys in or‐
       der for them to reflect the network/pid namespace context of the attached  process.  In  order
       not to interfere with the host's actual filesystem, the mount namespace will be unshared (like
       lxc-unshare does) before this is done, essentially giving the process a new  mount  namespace,
       which is identical to the hosts's mount namespace except for the /proc and /sys filesystems.

       Previous  versions  of  lxc-attach  suffered a bug whereby a user could attach to a containers
       namespace without being placed in a writeable cgroup for some critical subsystems. Newer  ver‐
       sions of lxc-attach will check whether a user is in a writeable cgroup for those critical sub‐
       systems. lxc-attach might thus fail unexpectedly for some users (E.g. on systems where an  un‐
       privileged  user is not placed in a writeable cgroup in critical subsystems on login.). Howev‐
       er, this behavior is correct and more secure.

SECURITY
       The -e and -s options should be used with care, as it may break the isolation of the  contain‐
       ers if used improperly.
