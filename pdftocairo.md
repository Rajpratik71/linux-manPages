NAME
       pdftocairo     -     Portable     Document     Format     (PDF)     to
       PNG/JPEG/TIFF/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG using cairo

SYNOPSIS
       pdftocairo [options] PDF-file [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       pdftocairo converts Portable Document Format (PDF)  files,  using  the
       cairo  output device of the poppler PDF library, to any of the follow‐
       ing output formats:

       ·      Portable Network Graphics (PNG)

       ·      JPEG Interchange Format (JPEG)

       ·      Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)

       ·      Portable Document Format (PDF)

       ·      PostScript (PS)

       ·      Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

       ·      Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

       ·      Windows Printer

       pdftocairo reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and  writes  to  output-file.
       The  image  formats  (PNG,  JPEG, and TIFF) generate one file per page
       with the page number and file  type  appended  to  output-file.   When
       -singlefile  is used with the image formats, the file type is appended
       to output-file.  When the output format is a vector format  (PDF,  PS,
       EPS, and SVG), output-file is the full filename.

       If  the  PDF-file is “-” , the PDF is read from stdin.  If the output-
       file is “-” , the output file will be written to stdout. Using  stdout
       is  not  valid with image formats unless -singlefile is used.  If out‐
       put-file is not used, the output filename will  be  derived  from  the
       PDF-file filename.

       Not  all options are valid with all output formats. One (and only one)
       of the output format options (-png, -jpeg, -tiff, -pdf,  -print,  -ps,
       -eps, or -svg) must be used.

       The  resolution options (-r, -rx, -ry) set the resolution of the image
       output formats. The image dimensions will depend on the PDF page  size
       and  the  resolution. For the vector outputs, regions of the page that
       can not be represented natively in the output format (eg  translucency
       in  PS)  will be rasterized at the resolution specified by the resolu‐
       tion options.

       The -scale-to options may be used to set a fixed image size. The image
       resolution will vary with the page size.

       The cropping options (-x, -y, -W, and -H) use units of pixels with the
       image formats and PostScript points (1/72 inch) with the  vector  for‐
       mats.  When  cropping is used with vector output the cropped region is
       centered unless -nocenter is used in which case the cropped region  is
       at the top left (SVG) or bottom left (PDF, PS, EPS).

OPTIONS
       -png   Generates a PNG file(s)

       -jpeg  Generates a JPEG file(s). See also -jpegopt.

       -tiff  Generates a TIFF file(s)

       -pdf   Generates a PDF file

       -ps    Generate a PS file

       -eps   Generate  an  EPS file. An EPS file contains a single image, so
              if you use this option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use
              -f  and  -l  to  specify  a single page.  The page size options
              (-origpagesizes, -paper, -paperw, -paperh) can not be used with
              this option.

       -svg   Generate a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file

       -print (Windows  only)  Prints  to a system printer. See also -printer
              and -printeropt.
               If an output file is not specified, the output will be sent to
              the printer.
               The output file '-' can not be used with this option.

       -printdlg
              (Windows  only)  Prints to a system printer. Displays the print
              dialog to allow the print options to be modified before  print‐
              ing.

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to convert.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to convert.

       -o     Generates only the odd numbered pages.

       -e     Generates only the even numbered pages.

       -singlefile
              Writes only the first page and does not add digits.

       -r number
              Specifies  the  X and Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image
              files (or rasterized regions in vector output). The default  is
              150 PPI.

       -rx number
              Specifies  the  X resolution, in pixels per inch of image files
              (or rasterized regions in vector output). The  default  is  150
              PPI.

       -ry number
              Specifies  the  Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image files
              (or rasterized regions in vector output). The  default  is  150
              PPI.

       -scale-to number
              Scales  the  long side of each page (width for landscape pages,
              height for portrait pages) to fit in scale-to pixels. The  size
              of the short side will be determined by the aspect ratio of the
              page (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -scale-to-x number
              Scales each page horizontally to fit in scale-to-x  pixels.  If
              scale-to-y  is  set to -1, the vertical size will determined by
              the aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -scale-to-y number
              Scales each page vertically to fit  in  scale-to-y  pixels.  If
              scale-to-x is set to -1, the horizontal size will determined by
              the aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -x number
              Specifies the x-coordinate of the crop area top left corner  in
              pixels (image output) or points (vector output)

       -y number

              pixels (image output) or points (vector output)

       -W number
              Specifies the width of crop area in pixels  (image  output)  or
              points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -H number
              Specifies  the  height of crop area in pixels (image output) or
              points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -sz number
              Specifies the size of crop square in pixels (image  output)  or
              points (vector output)  (sets -W and -H)

       -cropbox
              Uses  the  crop  box  rather than media box when generating the
              files (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only)

       -mono  Generate a monochrome file (PNG and TIFF only).

       -gray  Generate a grayscale file (PNG, JPEG, and TIFF only).

       -antialias
              Set the cairo antialias option used for  text  and  drawing  in
              image  files  (or  rasterized  regions  in  vector output). The
              options are:

              default
                     Use the default antialiasing for the target device. This
                     is the default setting if -antialias is not used.

              none   Antialiasing is disabled.

              gray   Perform single-color antialiasing using shades of gray.

              subpixel
                     Perform antialiasing by taking advantage of the order of
                     subpixel elements on devices such as LCD.

              fast   Hint that the backend should perform  some  antialiasing
                     but prefer speed over quality.

              good   The backend should balance quality against performance.

              best   Hint that the backend should render at the highest qual‐
                     ity, sacrificing speed if necessary.

       -transp
              Use a transparent page color instead of  white  (PNG  and  TIFF
              only).

       -icc icc-file
              Use  the  specified  ICC file as the output profile (PNG only).
              The profile will be embedded in the PNG file.

       -jpegopt jpeg-options
              When used with -jpeg, takes a list of options  to  control  the
              jpeg compression. See JPEG OPTIONS for the available options.

       -level2
              Generate Level 2 PostScript (PS only).

       -level3
              Generate Level 3 PostScript (PS only). This enables all Level 2
              features plus shading patterns and masked images. This  is  the
              default setting.

       -origpagesizes
              This option is the same as "-paper match".

       -paper size
              Set  the  paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3"
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).  This can also be set to "match", which will
              set  the paper size of each page to match the size specified in
              the PDF file. If none the -paper, -paperw, or  -paperh  options
              are specified the default is to match the paper size.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only).

       -paperh size
              Set the paper height, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only).

       -nocrop
              By default, printing output is cropped to the CropBox specified
              in the PDF file.  This  option  disables  cropping  (PS,PDF,SVG
              only).

       -expand
              Expand  PDF  pages  smaller  than  the  paper to fill the paper
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By default, these pages are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don't  scale  PDF  pages  which  are  larger  than  the   paper
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By default, pages larger than the paper are
              shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after  any  scal‐
              ing)  are centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be
              aligned  to  the  lower-left  corner  of  the   paper   instead
              (PS,PDF,SVG only).

       -duplex
              Adds  the  %%IncludeFeature: *Duplex DuplexNoTumble DSC comment
              to the PostScript file (PS only).  This tells the print manager
              to enable duplexing.

       -printer printer-name
              (Windows  only).  When  used with -print, specifies the name of
              the printer to be used, instead of the system default.

       -printopt printer-options
              (Windows only). When used with -print, takes a list of  options
              to  be  used  to  configure  the  printer.  See WINDOWS PRINTER
              OPTIONS for the available options.

       -setupdlg
              (Windows only). When used with -print, the  printer  properties
              dialog  is displayed allowing the print settings to be modified
              before printing. The paper size selected in the  print  proper‐
              ties  dialog  will be used except when -origpagesizes is speci‐
              fied.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF  file.   Providing  this
              will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The poppler tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       4      Error related to ICC profile.

       99     Other error.

JPEG OPTIONS
       When JPEG output is specified, the -jpegopt option can be used to con‐
       trol the JPEG compression parameters.  It takes a string of  the  form
       "<opt>=<val>[,<opt>=<val>]". Currently the available options are:

       quality
              Selects  the  JPEG  quality value. The value must be an integer
              between 0 and 100.

       progressive
              Select progressive JPEG output. The possible  values  are  "y",
              "n",  indicating  progressive  (yes)  or  non-progressive (no),
              respectively.

WINDOWS PRINTER OPTIONS
       In Windows, you can use the -print option to print directly to a  sys‐
       tem printer. Additionally, you can use the -printopt option to config‐
       ure   the   printer.   It    takes    a    string    of    the    form
       "<opt>=<val>[,<opt>=<val>]". Currently the available options are:

       source Selects  the  source  paper tray to be used (bin). The possible
              values are "upper",  "onlyone",  "lower",  "middle",  "manual",
              "envelope",   "envmanual",   "auto",   "tractor",   "smallfmt",
              "largefmt", "largecapacity", "formsource", or a  numeric  value
              to choose a driver specific source.

       duplex Sets  the  duplex  mode of the printer. The possible values are
              "off", "short" or "long", indicating no  duplexing,  short-edge
              binding,  or  long-edge  binding, respectively.  General option
              -duplex is a synonym of  "duplex=long".  If  both  options  are
              specified, -printopt has priority.
