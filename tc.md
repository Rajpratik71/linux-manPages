DESCRIPTION
       Tc  is  used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. Traffic
       Control consists of the following:

       SHAPING
              When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under  con‐
              trol. Shaping may be more than lowering the available bandwidth
              - it is also used to smooth out bursts in  traffic  for  better
              network behaviour. Shaping occurs on egress.

       SCHEDULING
              By  scheduling  the  transmission  of packets it is possible to
              improve interactivity for traffic that  needs  it  while  still
              guaranteeing  bandwidth  to  bulk transfers. Reordering is also
              called prioritizing, and happens only on egress.

       POLICING
              Whereas shaping deals with transmission  of  traffic,  policing
              pertains to traffic arriving. Policing thus occurs on ingress.

       DROPPING
              Traffic  exceeding  a  set bandwidth may also be dropped forth‐
              with, both on ingress and on egress.

       Processing of traffic is controlled by three kinds of objects: qdiscs,
       classes and filters.

QDISCS
       qdisc  is  short  for  'queueing  discipline'  and it is elementary to
       understanding traffic control. Whenever the kernel  needs  to  send  a
       packet  to  an  interface,  it is enqueued to the qdisc configured for
       that interface. Immediately afterwards, the kernel  tries  to  get  as
       many  packets  as possible from the qdisc, for giving them to the net‐
       work adaptor driver.

       A simple QDISC is the 'pfifo' one, which does no processing at all and
       is  a  pure  First  In, First Out queue. It does however store traffic
       when the network interface can't handle it momentarily.

CLASSES
       Some qdiscs can contain classes, which contain further qdiscs -  traf‐
       fic  may then be enqueued in any of the inner qdiscs, which are within
       the classes.  When the kernel tries to dequeue a packet  from  such  a
       classful  qdisc  it  can come from any of the classes. A qdisc may for
       example prioritize certain kinds of traffic by trying to dequeue  from
       certain classes before others.

FILTERS
       A  filter  is  used  by a classful qdisc to determine in which class a
       packet will be enqueued. Whenever traffic arrives at a class with sub‐
       classes, it needs to be classified. Various methods may be employed to
       do so, one of these are the filters. All filters attached to the class
       are  called,  until  one of them returns with a verdict. If no verdict
       was made, other criteria may be available. This differs per qdisc.

       It is important to notice that filters reside within qdiscs - they are
       not masters of what happens.

       The available filters are:

       basic  Filter  packets based on an ematch expression. See tc-ematch(8)
              for details.

       bpf    Filter packets using (e)BPF, see tc-bpf(8) for details.

       cgroup Filter packets based on the control group of their process. See
              tc-cgroup(8) for details.

       flow, flower
              Flow-based  classifiers,  filtering packets based on their flow
              (identified  by  selectable  keys).  See  tc-flow(8)  and   tc-
              flower(8) for details.

       fw     Filter  based  on fwmark. Directly maps fwmark value to traffic
              class. See tc-fw(8).

       route  Filter packets based on  routing  table.  See  tc-route(8)  for
              details.

       rsvp   Match Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) packets.

       tcindex
              Filter  packets  based  on  traffic control index. See tc-tcin‐
              dex(8).

       u32    Generic filtering on arbitrary packet data, assisted by  syntax
              to abstract common operations. See tc-u32(8) for details.

       matchall
              Traffic  control  filter  that  matches  every  packet. See tc-
              matchall(8) for details.

CLASSLESS QDISCS
       The classless qdiscs are:

       choke  CHOKe (CHOose and Keep for responsive flows,  CHOose  and  Kill
              for  unresponsive  flows) is a classless qdisc designed to both
              identify and penalize flows that monopolize the queue. CHOKe is
              a variation of RED, and the configuration is similar to RED.

       codel  CoDel  (pronounced  "coddle")  is an adaptive "no-knobs" active
              queue management algorithm (AQM) scheme that was  developed  to
              address the shortcomings of RED and its variants.

       [p|b]fifo
              Simplest usable qdisc, pure First In, First Out behaviour. Lim‐
              ited in packets or in bytes.

       fq     Fair Queue Scheduler realises TCP pacing and scales to millions
              of concurrent flows per qdisc.

       fq_codel
              Fair  Queuing  Controlled Delay is queuing discipline that com‐
              bines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme. FQ_Codel  uses  a
              stochastic  model  to  classify incoming packets into different
              flows and is used to provide a fair share of the  bandwidth  to
              all the flows using the queue. Each such flow is managed by the
              CoDel queuing discipline. Reordering within a flow  is  avoided
              since Codel internally uses a FIFO queue.

       gred   Generalized Random Early Detection combines multiple RED queues
              in order to achieve multiple drop priorities. This is  required
              to realize Assured Forwarding (RFC 2597).

       hhf    Heavy-Hitter  Filter differentiates between small flows and the
              opposite, heavy-hitters. The goal is to catch the heavy-hitters
              and  move  them  to a separate queue with less priority so that
              bulk traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.

       ingress
              This is a special qdisc as it applies to incoming traffic on an
              interface, allowing for it to be filtered and policed.

       mqprio The  Multiqueue  Priority  Qdisc is a simple queuing discipline
              that allows mapping traffic  flows  to  hardware  queue  ranges
              using  priorities  and a configurable priority to traffic class
              mapping. A traffic class in this context is a set of contiguous
              qdisc  classes  which  map  1:1  to  a  set of hardware exposed
              queues.

       multiq Multiqueue is a qdisc optimized for devices  with  multiple  Tx
              queues.  It  has  been  added for hardware that wishes to avoid
              head-of-line blocking.  It will cycle though the bands and ver‐
              ify  that  the  hardware  queue associated with the band is not
              stopped prior to dequeuing a packet.

       netem  Network Emulator is an enhancement of the Linux traffic control
              facilities  that  allow  to add delay, packet loss, duplication
              and more other  characteristics  to  packets  outgoing  from  a
              selected network interface.

       pfifo_fast
              Standard  qdisc for 'Advanced Router' enabled kernels. Consists
              of a three-band queue which honors Type of  Service  flags,  as
              well as the priority that may be assigned to a packet.

       pie    Proportional  Integral  controller-Enhanced  (PIE) is a control
              theoretic active queue management scheme. It is  based  on  the
              proportional integral controller but aims to control delay.

       red    Random  Early  Detection  simulates physical congestion by ran‐
              domly dropping packets when nearing configured bandwidth  allo‐
              cation. Well suited to very large bandwidth applications.

       rr     Round-Robin  qdisc with support for multiqueue network devices.
              Removed from Linux since kernel version 2.6.27.

       sfb    Stochastic Fair Blue is a classless qdisc to manage  congestion
              based  on packet loss and link utilization history while trying
              to prevent non-responsive flows (i.e. flows that do  not  react
              to  congestion  marking or dropped packets) from impacting per‐
              formance of responsive flows.  Unlike RED,  where  the  marking
              probability  has  to be configured, BLUE tries to determine the
              ideal marking probability automatically.

       sfq    Stochastic Fairness Queueing reorders queued  traffic  so  each
              'session' gets to send a packet in turn.

       tbf    The Token Bucket Filter is suited for slowing traffic down to a
              precisely configured rate. Scales well to large bandwidths.

CONFIGURING CLASSLESS QDISCS
       In the absence of  classful  qdiscs,  classless  qdiscs  can  only  be
       attached at the root of a device. Full syntax:

       tc qdisc add dev DEV root QDISC QDISC-PARAMETERS

       To remove, issue

       tc qdisc del dev DEV root

       The pfifo_fast qdisc is the automatic default in the absence of a con‐
       figured qdisc.

CLASSFUL QDISCS
       The classful qdiscs are:

       ATM    Map flows to virtual circuits  of  an  underlying  asynchronous
              transfer mode device.

       CBQ    Class Based Queueing implements a rich linksharing hierarchy of
              classes.  It contains shaping elements as well as  prioritizing
              capabilities.  Shaping is performed using link idle time calcu‐
              lations based on average packet size and underlying link  band‐
              width. The latter may be ill-defined for some interfaces.

       DRR    The  Deficit  Round Robin Scheduler is a more flexible replace‐
              ment for Stochastic Fairness Queuing. Unlike SFQ, there are  no
              built-in queues -- you need to add classes and then set up fil‐
              ters to classify packets accordingly.  This can be useful  e.g.
              for  using  RED  qdiscs  with different settings for particular
              traffic. There is no default class -- if  a  packet  cannot  be
              classified, it is dropped.

       DSMARK Classify  packets based on TOS field, change TOS field of pack‐
              ets based on classification.

       HFSC   Hierarchical Fair Service Curve  guarantees  precise  bandwidth
              and  delay  allocation  for  leaf  classes and allocates excess
              bandwidth fairly. Unlike HTB, it makes use of  packet  dropping
              to achieve low delays which interactive sessions benefit from.

       HTB    The  Hierarchy Token Bucket implements a rich linksharing hier‐
              archy of classes with an emphasis  on  conforming  to  existing
              practices.  HTB  facilitates guaranteeing bandwidth to classes,
              while also allowing specification of  upper  limits  to  inter-
              class  sharing.  It contains shaping elements, based on TBF and
              can prioritize classes.

       PRIO   The PRIO qdisc is a non-shaping container  for  a  configurable
              number  of classes which are dequeued in order. This allows for
              easy prioritization of traffic, where lower  classes  are  only
              able  to  send  if  higher  ones  have no packets available. To
              facilitate configuration, Type Of Service bits are  honored  by
              default.

       QFQ    Quick  Fair  Queueing  is an O(1) scheduler that provides near-
              optimal guarantees, and is the first to achieve that goal  with
              a  constant  cost also with respect to the number of groups and
              the packet length. The QFQ algorithm has  no  loops,  and  uses
              very  simple  instructions  and data structures that lend them‐
              selves very well to a hardware implementation.

THEORY OF OPERATION
       Classes form a tree, where each class has a single  parent.   A  class
       may  have multiple children. Some qdiscs allow for runtime addition of
       classes (CBQ, HTB) while others (PRIO) are created with a static  num‐
       ber of children.

       Qdiscs  which  allow dynamic addition of classes can have zero or more
       subclasses to which traffic may be enqueued.

       Furthermore, each class contains a leaf qdisc  which  by  default  has
       pfifo behaviour, although another qdisc can be attached in place. This
       qdisc may again contain classes, but each class can have only one leaf
       qdisc.

       When  a  packet enters a classful qdisc it can be classified to one of
       the classes within. Three criteria are  available,  although  not  all
       qdiscs will use all three:

       tc filters
              If tc filters are attached to a class, they are consulted first
              for relevant instructions. Filters can match on all fields of a
              packet  header,  as  well  as  on  the firewall mark applied by
              ipchains or iptables.

       Type of Service
              Some qdiscs have built in rules for classifying  packets  based
              on the TOS field.

       skb->priority
              Userspace programs can encode a class-id in the 'skb->priority'
              field using the SO_PRIORITY option.

       Each node within the tree can have its own filters  but  higher  level
       filters may also point directly to lower classes.

       If  classification  did  not succeed, packets are enqueued to the leaf
       qdisc attached to  that  class.  Check  qdisc  specific  manpages  for
       details, however.

NAMING
       All  qdiscs,  classes and filters have IDs, which can either be speci‐
       fied or be automatically assigned.

       IDs consist of a major number and a minor number, separated by a colon
       -  major:minor.   Both major and minor are hexadecimal numbers and are
       limited to 16 bits. There are two special values: root is signified by
       major and minor of all ones, and unspecified is all zeros.

       QDISCS A  qdisc,  which potentially can have children, gets assigned a
              major number, called  a  'handle',  leaving  the  minor  number
              namespace  available  for  classes.  The handle is expressed as
              '10:'.  It is customary to explicitly assign a handle to qdiscs
              expected to have children.

       CLASSES
              Classes  residing under a qdisc share their qdisc major number,
              but each have a separate minor number called a  'classid'  that
              has  no  relation to their parent classes, only to their parent
              qdisc. The same naming custom as for qdiscs applies.

       FILTERS
              Filters have a three part ID, which is only needed when using a
              hashed filter hierarchy.

PARAMETERS
       The  following parameters are widely used in TC. For other parameters,
       see the man pages for individual qdiscs.

       RATES  Bandwidths or rates.  These parameters accept a floating  point
              number,  possibly  followed  by  either a unit (both SI and IEC
              units supported), or a float followed by  a  '%'  character  to
              specify  the  rate  as a percentage of the device's speed (e.g.
              5%, 99.5%). Warning: specifying the rate as a percentage  means
              a  fraction  of  the  current  speed; if the speed changes, the
              value will not be recalculated.

              bit or a bare number
                     Bits per second

              kbit   Kilobits per second

              mbit   Megabits per second

              gbit   Gigabits per second

              tbit   Terabits per second

              bps    Bytes per second

              kbps   Kilobytes per second

              mbps   Megabytes per second

              gbps   Gigabytes per second

              tbps   Terabytes per second

              To specify in IEC units, replace the SI prefix (k-, m-, g-, t-)
              with IEC prefix (ki-, mi-, gi- and ti-) respectively.

              TC  store rates as a 32-bit unsigned integer in bps internally,
              so we can specify a max rate of 4294967295 bps.

       TIMES  Length of time. Can be specified as  a  floating  point  number
              followed by an optional unit:

              s, sec or secs
                     Whole seconds

              ms, msec or msecs
                     Milliseconds

              us, usec, usecs or a bare number
                     Microseconds.

              TC  defined its own time unit (equal to microsecond) and stores
              time values as 32-bit unsigned integer, thus we can  specify  a
              max time value of 4294967295 usecs.

       SIZES  Amounts  of  data.  Can be specified as a floating point number
              followed by an optional unit:

              b or a bare number
                     Bytes.

              kbit   Kilobits

              kb or k
                     Kilobytes

              mbit   Megabits

              mb or m
                     Megabytes

              gbit   Gigabits

              gb or g
                     Gigabytes

              TC stores sizes internally as 32-bit unsigned integer in  byte,
              so we can specify a max size of 4294967295 bytes.

       VALUES Other  values without a unit.  These parameters are interpreted
              as decimal by default, but you can  indicate  TC  to  interpret
              them  as  octal  and hexadecimal by adding a '0' or '0x' prefix
              respectively.

TC COMMANDS
       The following commands are available for qdiscs, classes and filter:

       add    Add a qdisc, class or filter to a node.  For  all  entities,  a
              parent must be passed, either by passing its ID or by attaching
              directly to the root of a device.  When creating a qdisc  or  a
              filter,  it  can be named with the handle parameter. A class is
              named with the classid parameter.

       delete A qdisc can be deleted by specifying its handle, which may also
              be  'root'.  All subclasses and their leaf qdiscs are automati‐
              cally deleted, as well as any filters attached to them.

       change Some entities can be modified 'in place'. Shares the syntax  of
              'add', with the exception that the handle cannot be changed and
              neither can the parent. In other words, change  cannot  move  a
              node.

       replace
              Performs  a nearly atomic remove/add on an existing node id. If
              the node does not exist yet it is created.

       get    Displays a single filter given  the  interface  DEV,  qdisc-id,
              priority, protocol and filter-id.

       show   Displays  all  filters attached to the given interface. A valid
              parent ID must be passed.

       link   Only available for qdiscs and performs a replace where the node
              must exist already.

OPTIONS
       -b, -b filename, -batch, -batch filename
              read  commands  from provided file or standard input and invoke
              them.  First failure will cause termination of tc.

       -force don't terminate tc on errors in batch mode.  If there were  any
              errors during execution of the commands, the application return
              code will be non zero.

       -n, -net, -netns <NETNS>
              switches tc to the specified network namespace NETNS.  Actually
              it just simplifies executing of:

              ip netns exec NETNS tc [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

              to

              tc -n[etns] NETNS [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       -cf, -conf <FILENAME>
              specifies  path to the config file. This option is used in con‐
              junction with other options (e.g.  -nm).

FORMAT
       The show command has additional formatting options:

       -s, -stats, -statistics
              output more statistics about packet usage.

       -d, -details
              output more detailed information about rates and cell sizes.

       -r, -raw
              output raw hex values for handles.

       -p, -pretty
              decode filter offset and mask values to equivalent filter  com‐
              mands based on TCP/IP.

       -iec   print rates in IEC units (ie. 1K = 1024).

       -g, -graph
              shows  classes  as ASCII graph. Prints generic stats info under
              each class if -s option was specified. Classes can be  filtered
              only by dev option.

       -j, -json
              Display results in JSON format.

       -nm, -name
              resolve  class name from /etc/iproute2/tc_cls file or from file
              specified by -cf option. This file is just a mapping of classid
              to class name:

                 # Here is comment
                 1:40   voip # Here is another comment
                 1:50   web
                 1:60   ftp
                 1:2    home

              tc  will  not  fail if -nm was specified without -cf option but
              /etc/iproute2/tc_cls file does not exist, which makes it possi‐
              ble to pass -nm option for creating tc alias.

EXAMPLES
       tc -g class show dev eth0
           Shows classes as ASCII graph on eth0 interface.

       tc -g -s class show dev eth0
           Shows classes as ASCII graph with stats info under each class.

HISTORY
       tc was written by Alexey N. Kuznetsov and added in Linux 2.2.
