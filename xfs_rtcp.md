NAME
       xfs_rtcp - XFS realtime copy command

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_rtcp [ -e extsize ] [ -p ] source ... target
       xfs_rtcp -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_rtcp copies a file to the realtime partition on an XFS filesystem.  If there is more than one source and target, the final argument (the target) must be a directory which already exists.

OPTIONS
       -e extsize
              Sets the extent size of the destination realtime file.

       -p     Use  if the size of the source file is not an even multiple of the block size of the destination filesystem. When -p is specified xfs_rtcp will pad the destination file to a size which is
              an even multiple of the filesystem block size.  This is necessary since the realtime file is created using direct I/O and the minimum I/O is the filesystem block size.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.

SEE ALSO
       xfs(5), mkfs.xfs(8), mount(8).

CAVEATS
       Currently, realtime partitions are not supported under the Linux version of XFS, and use of a realtime partition WILL CAUSE CORRUPTION on the data partition. As such, this command is made avail‐
       able for curious DEVELOPERS ONLY at this point in time.
