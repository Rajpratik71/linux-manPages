MKFS.FAT(8)                System Manager's Manual                MKFS.FAT(8)

NAME
       mkfs.fat - create an MS-DOS filesystem under Linux

SYNOPSIS
       mkfs.fat [OPTIONS] DEVICE [BLOCK-COUNT]

DESCRIPTION
       mkfs.fat  is  used  to  create  an  MS-DOS filesystem under Linux on a
       device (usually a disk partition).  DEVICE is the special file  corre‐
       sponding to the device (e.g. /dev/sdXX).  BLOCK-COUNT is the number of
       blocks on the device.  If omitted, mkfs.fat  automatically  determines
       the filesystem size.

OPTIONS
       -a  Normally, for any filesystem except very small ones, mkfs.fat will
           align all the data structures to cluster size, to make  sure  that
           as long as the partition is properly aligned, so will all the data
           structures in the filesystem.   This  option  disables  alignment;
           this  may  provide  a handful of additional clusters of storage at
           the expense of a significant  performance  degradation  on  RAIDs,
           flash media or large-sector hard disks.

        -A Use  Atari variation of the MS-DOS filesystem.  This is default if
           mkfs.fat is run on an Atari, then this option turns off Atari for‐
           mat.   There  are some differences when using Atari format: If not
           directed otherwise by the user, mkfs.fat will always use 2 sectors
           per cluster, since GEMDOS doesn't like other values very much.  It
           will also obey the maximum number of sectors  GEMDOS  can  handle.
           Larger filesystems are managed by raising the logical sector size.
           Under Atari format, an  Atari-compatible  serial  number  for  the
           filesystem  is  generated,  and  a  12  bit  FAT  is used only for
           filesystems that have one of the usual floppy sizes  (720k,  1.2M,
           1.44M,  2.88M),  a  16  bit FAT otherwise.  This can be overridden
           with the -F option.  Some PC-specific boot  sector  fields  aren't
           written, and a boot message (option -m) is ignored.

       -b SECTOR-OF-BACKUP
           Selects the location of the backup boot sector for FAT32.  Default
           depends on number of reserved sectors, but usually  is  sector  6.
           The backup must be within the range of reserved sectors.

       -c  Check the device for bad blocks before creating the filesystem.

       -C  Create the file given as DEVICE on the command line, and write the
           to-be-created filesystem to it.  This can be used  to  create  the
           new filesystem in a file instead of on a real device, and to avoid
           using dd in advance to create a file of  appropriate  size.   With
           this  option, the BLOCK-COUNT must be given, because otherwise the
           intended size of the filesystem wouldn't be known.  The file  cre‐
           ated  is a sparse file, which actually only contains the meta-data
           areas (boot sector, FATs, and root directory).  The data  portions
           won't  be  stored on the disk, but the file nevertheless will have
           the correct size.  The resulting file can be  copied  later  to  a
           floppy disk or other device, or mounted through a loop device.

       -D DRIVE-NUMBER
           Specify the BIOS drive number to be stored in the FAT boot sector.
           This value is usually 0x80 for hard  disks  and  0x00  for  floppy
           devices or partitions to be used for floppy emulation.

       -f NUMBER-OF-FATS
           Specify  the  number  of file allocation tables in the filesystem.
           The default is 2.

       -F FAT-SIZE
           Specifies the type of file allocation tables used (12,  16  or  32
           bit).  If nothing is specified, mkfs.fat will automatically select
           between 12, 16 and 32 bit, whatever fits better for the filesystem
           size.

       -h NUMBER-OF-HIDDEN-SECTORS
           Select  the  number  of  hidden sectors in the volume.  Apparently
           some digital cameras get indigestion if you feed them  a  CF  card
           without  such  hidden  sectors,  this option allows you to satisfy
           them.

       -i VOLUME-ID
           Sets the volume ID of the newly created filesystem; VOLUME-ID is a
           32-bit hexadecimal number (for example, 2e24ec82).  The default is
           a number which depends on the filesystem creation time.

       -I  It is typical for fixed disk devices  to  be  partitioned  so,  by
           default,  you  are not permitted to create a filesystem across the
           entire device.  mkfs.fat  will  complain  and  tell  you  that  it
           refuses  to  work.   This  is  different when using MO disks.  One
           doesn't always need partitions on MO disks.  The filesystem can go
           directly to the whole disk.  Under other OSes this is known as the
           'superfloppy' format.  This switch will  force  mkfs.fat  to  work
           properly.

       -l FILENAME
           Read the bad blocks list from FILENAME.

       -m MESSAGE-FILE
           Sets  the  message  the  user  receives  on  attempts to boot this
           filesystem without having properly installed an operating  system.
           The  message  file  must not exceed 418 bytes once line feeds have
           been converted to carriage return-line feed combinations, and tabs
           have  been expanded.  If the filename is a hyphen (-), the text is
           taken from standard input.

       -M FAT-MEDIA-TYPE
           Specify the media type to be stored in the FAT boot sector.   This
           value  is  usually 0xF8 for hard disks and is 0xF0 or a value from
           0xF9 to 0xFF for floppies or partitions to be used for floppy emu‐
           lation.

       -n VOLUME-NAME
           Sets  the  volume name (label) of the filesystem.  The volume name
           can be up to 11 characters long.  The default is no label.

       -r ROOT-DIR-ENTRIES
           Select the number of entries available in the root directory.  The
           default is 112 or 224 for floppies and 512 for hard disks.

       -R NUMBER-OF-RESERVED-SECTORS
           Select the number of reserved sectors.  With FAT32 format at least
           2 reserved sectors are needed, the default is 32.   Otherwise  the
           default is 1 (only the boot sector).

       -s SECTORS-PER-CLUSTER
           Specify  the  number of disk sectors per cluster.  Must be a power
           of 2, i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 128.

       -S LOGICAL-SECTOR-SIZE
           Specify the number of bytes per logical sector.  Must be  a  power
           of 2 and greater than or equal to 512, i.e. 512, 1024, 2048, 4096,
           8192, 16384, or 32768.  Values larger than 4096 are not conforming
           to the FAT file system specification and may not work everywhere.

       -v  Verbose execution.

       --invariant
           Use  constants  for normally randomly generated or time based data
           such as volume ID and creation time.  Multiple runs of mkfs.fat on
           the  same  device  create identical results with this option.  Its
           main purpose is testing mkfs.fat.

       --help
           Display option summary and exit.

BUGS
       mkfs.fat can not create boot-able filesystems.  This isn't as easy  as
       you  might think at first glance for various reasons and has been dis‐
       cussed a lot already.  mkfs.fat simply will not support it ;)
