SYNOPSIS
       dnstap-read [-m] [-p] [-y] {file}

       is specified, then a longer and more detailed YAML format is used instead.

OPTIONS

       -p
           After printing the dnstap data, print the text form of the DNS message that was encapsulated in the dnstap frame.

       -y
           Print dnstap data in a detailed YAML format.
