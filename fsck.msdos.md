FSCK.FAT(8)                System Manager's Manual                FSCK.FAT(8)

NAME
       fsck.fat - check and repair MS-DOS filesystems

SYNOPSIS
       fsck.fat [OPTIONS] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       fsck.fat verifies the consistency of MS-DOS filesystems and optionally
       tries to repair them.

       The following filesystem problems can be corrected (in this order):

       *   FAT contains invalid cluster numbers.  Cluster is changed to EOF.

       *   File's cluster chain contains a loop.  The loop is broken.

       *   Bad clusters (read errors).  The clusters are marked bad and  they
           are removed from files owning them.  This check is optional.

       *   Directories with a large number of bad entries (probably corrupt).
           The directory can be deleted.

       *   Files . and ..  are  non-directories.   They  can  be  deleted  or
           renamed.

       *   Directories . and .. in root directory.  They are deleted.

       *   Bad filenames.  They can be renamed.

       *   Duplicate directory entries.  They can be deleted or renamed.

       *   Directories with non-zero size field.  Size is set to zero.

       *   Directory . does not point to parent directory.  The start pointer
           is adjusted.

       *   Directory .. does not point to parent of  parent  directory.   The
           start pointer is adjusted.

       *   Start cluster number of a file is invalid.  The file is truncated.

       *   File contains bad or free clusters.  The file is truncated.

       *   File's  cluster chain is longer than indicated by the size fields.
           The file is truncated.

       *   Two or more files share the same cluster(s).  All but one  of  the
           files  are  truncated.  If the file being truncated is a directory
           file that has already been read, the filesystem check is restarted
           after truncation.

       *   File's cluster chain is shorter than indicated by the size fields.
           The file is truncated.

       *   Clusters are marked as used but are not owned by a file.  They are
           marked as free.

       Additionally, the following problems are detected, but not repaired:

       *   Invalid parameters in boot sector

       *   Absence of . and .. entries in non-root directories

       When  fsck.fat checks a filesystem, it accumulates all changes in mem‐
       ory and performs them only after all checks are complete.  This can be
       disabled with the -w option.

OPTIONS
       -a  Automatically repair the filesystem.  No user intervention is nec‐
           essary.  Whenever there is more than one method to solve  a  prob‐
           lem, the least destructive approach is used.

       -A  Use  Atari variation of the MS-DOS filesystem.  This is default if
           fsck.fat is run on an Atari, then this option turns off Atari for‐
           mat.   There are some minor differences in Atari format: Some boot
           sector fields are interpreted slightly different, and the  special
           FAT  entries  for  end-of-file  and  bad cluster can be different.
           Under MS-DOS 0xfff8 is used for EOF and Atari  employs  0xffff  by
           default,    but   both   systems   recognize   all   values   from
           0xfff8...0xffff as end-of-file.  MS-DOS uses only 0xfff7  for  bad
           clusters,  where on Atari values 0xfff0...0xfff7 are for this pur‐
           pose (but the standard value is still 0xfff7).

       -b  Make read-only boot sector check.

       -c PAGE
           Use DOS codepage PAGE to decode  short  file  names.   By  default
           codepage 437 is used.

       -d PATH
           Delete  the  specified file.  If more than one file with that name
           exist, the first one is deleted.  This option can  be  given  more
           than once.

       -f  Salvage  unused cluster chains to files.  By default, unused clus‐
           ters are added to the free disk space except in auto mode (-a).

       -l  List path names of files being processed.

       -n  No-operation mode: non-interactively check for errors,  but  don't
           write anything to the filesystem.

       -p  Same as -a, for compatibility with other *fsck.

       -r  Interactively repair the filesystem.  The user is asked for advice
           whenever there is more than one approach to fix an  inconsistency.
           This is the default mode and the option is only retained for back‐
           wards compatibility.

       -t  Mark unreadable clusters as bad.

       -u PATH
           Try to undelete the specified file.  fsck.fat tries to allocate  a
           chain  of contiguous unallocated clusters beginning with the start
           cluster of the undeleted file.  This option can be given more than
           once.

       -v  Verbose mode.  Generates slightly more output.

       -V  Perform  a  verification  pass.   The filesystem check is repeated
           after the first run.  The second pass should never report any fix‐
           able errors.  It may take considerably longer than the first pass,
           because the first pass may have generated long list  of  modifica‐
           tions that have to be scanned for each disk read.

       -w  Write changes to disk immediately.

       -y  Same  as  -a  (automatically  repair filesystem) for compatibility
           with other fsck tools.

EXIT STATUS
       0   No recoverable errors have been detected.

       1   Recoverable errors have been detected or fsck.fat  has  discovered
           an internal inconsistency.

       2   Usage error.  fsck.fat did not access the filesystem.

FILES
       fsck0000.rec, fsck0001.rec, ...
           When recovering from a corrupted filesystem, fsck.fat dumps recov‐
           ered data into files named 'fsckNNNN.rec' in the top level  direc‐
           tory of the filesystem.

BUGS
       Does  not  create  .  and  ..  files where necessary.  Does not remove
       entirely empty directories.  Should  give  more  diagnostic  messages.
       Undeleting files should use a more sophisticated algorithm.
