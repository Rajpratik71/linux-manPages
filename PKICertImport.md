PKICertImport(1)                                                                         PKI certificate import tool                                                                         PKICertImport(1)



NAME
       PKICertImport - Used to safely validate and import certificates into the NSS database.


SYNOPSIS
       Usage: PKICertImport -d <location of nssdb> -i <location of certificate> -n <nickname for certificate> -t <trust flags> -u <usage flags> [-h <hardware token name>] [-f <password file>] [-a]

       Validate and import a certificate into the specified NSS database. Verifies signature, trust chain, trust, and usage flags. If a certificate is not valid, it will not be added to the NSS DB or spec‚Äê
       ified hardware token.


DESCRIPTION
       The certificate import utility validates signature, trust chain, trust, and usage flags before importing a certificate into the specified NSS database. This  ensures  that  no  certificate  is  used
       before its authenticity has been verified. Unlike certutil, only one invocation is necessary to both validate and import certificates.

       See certutil for more information about the parameters to PKICertImport.
