NAME
       ifup - bring a network interface up

       ifdown - take a network interface down

SYNOPSIS
       ifup CONFIG [boot]

       ifdown CONFIG


DESCRIPTION
       The  ifup and ifdown commands may be used to configure (or, respec- tively, deconfigure) network interfaces based on interface definitions in the files /etc/sysconfig/network and /etc/sysconfig/net‚Äê
       work-scripts/ifcfg-<configuration>

       These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the configuration (e.g. eth0). They are called with a second argument of "boot" during the boot sequence so that devices that are not  meant  to
       be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at that time.


FILES
       /etc/sysconfig/network


       /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<configuration>
              The file defining an interface.
