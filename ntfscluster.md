NTFSCLUSTER(8)             System Manager's Manual             NTFSCLUSTER(8)

NAME
       ntfscluster - identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume.

SYNOPSIS
       ntfscluster [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfscluster has three modes of operation: info, sector and cluster.

   Info
       The  default mode, info is currently not implemented.  It will display
       general information about the NTFS volume when it is working.

   Sector
       The sector mode will display a list of files that  have  data  in  the
       specified range of sectors.

   Cluster
       The  cluster  mode  will display a list of files that have data in the
       specified range of clusters.  When the cluster  size  is  one  sector,
       this will be equivalent to the sector mode of operation.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary  of  all  the  options that ntfscluster accepts.
       Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is  pre‐
       ceded  by  -  and  the long name is preceded by --.  Any single letter
       options, that don't take an argument, can be combined  into  a  single
       command,  e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be
       abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -c, --cluster RANGE
              Any files whose data is in this range of clusters will be  dis‐
              played.

       -F, --filename NAME
              Show information about this file.

       -f, --force
              This  will override some sensible defaults, such as not working
              with a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -I, --inode NUM
              Show information about this inode.

       -i, --info
              This option is not yet implemented.

       -q, --quiet
              Reduce the amount  of  output  to  a  minimum.   Naturally,  it
              doesn't make sense to combine this option with

       -s, --sector RANGE
              Any  files  whose data is in this range of sectors will be dis‐
              played.

       -v, --verbose
              Increase the amount of output that ntfscluster prints.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license for ntfscluster.

EXAMPLES
       Get some information about the volume /dev/hda1.

              ntfscluster /dev/hda1

       Look for files in the first 500 clusters of /dev/hda1.

              ntfscluster -c 0-500 /dev/hda1

BUGS
       The info mode isn't implemented yet.  ntfscluster  is  quite  limited,
       but  it  has  no  known  bugs.  If you find a bug please send an email
       describing the problem to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net
