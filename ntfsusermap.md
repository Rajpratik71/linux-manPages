NTFSUSERMAP(8)                          System Manager's Manual                         NTFSUSERMAP(8)

NAME
       ntfsusermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsusermap windows-system-device [other-ntfs-device...]

       Where  windows-system-device  is the device containing the Windows system whose users are to be
       mapped to current Linux system.

       And other-ntfs-device is another device containing files which are to be accessed both  by  the
       Windows mentioned above and current Linux system.

       the  ntfsusermap  command  must  be  started  as  root,  and the designated devices must not be
       mounted.

       Typing ntfsusermap with no args will display a summary of command arguments.

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsusermap creates the file defining the mapping of Windows accounts to Linux logins for users
       who owns files which should be visible from both Windows and Linux.

       It  relies  on existing files which were created on Windows, trying to locate significant files
       and asking which Linux user or group should own them. When a Linux owner or group is requested,
       the reply may be :

       - the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of the file.
              In that situation, no more file with the same Windows owner will be selected.
       - or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
              In  that  situation another file owned by the same Windows user or group may be selected
              later so that a mapping can be defined.

       The mappings for standard Windows users, such as "Administrator" or "All Users" are defined im‐
       plicitly. As a consequence a user mapping should never be defined as Linux root.

       When  there  are  no  more significant files, ntfsusermap create the mapping file into the file
       UserMapping in the current directory. This file  has  to  be  moved  to  the  hidden  directory
       .NTFS-3G  in the root of all the NTFS file systems to be shared between Windows and Linux. This
       requires the file system to be mounted, but the created file will not be taken into account  if
       not  present  at  mount time, which means the file system has to be unmounted and mounted again
       for the new mapping file to be taken into account.

OPTIONS
       No option is defined for ntfsusermap.

EXAMPLES
       Map the users defined on the Windows system present on /dev/sda1 :

              ntfsusermap /dev/sda1

       A detailed  example,  with  screen  displays  is  available  on  http://jp-andre.pagesperso-or‐
       ange.fr/ntfsusermap.html

EXIT CODES
       ntfsusermap  exits  with a value of 0 when no error was detected, and with a value of 1 when an
       error was detected.
