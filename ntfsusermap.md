NTFSUSERMAP(8)             System Manager's Manual             NTFSUSERMAP(8)

NAME
       ntfsusermap - NTFS Building a User Mapping File

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsusermap windows-system-device [other-ntfs-device...]

       Where  windows-system-device is the device containing the Windows sys‐
       tem whose users are to be mapped to current Linux system.

       And other-ntfs-device is another device containing files which are  to
       be accessed both by the Windows mentioned above and current Linux sys‐
       tem.

       the ntfsusermap command must be started as root,  and  the  designated
       devices must not be mounted.

       Typing  ntfsusermap  with  no  args  will display a summary of command
       arguments.

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsusermap creates the file defining the mapping of Windows  accounts
       to  Linux logins for users who owns files which should be visible from
       both Windows and Linux.

       It relies on existing files which were created on Windows,  trying  to
       locate  significant  files and asking which Linux user or group should
       own them. When a Linux owner or group is requested, the reply may be :

       - the uid or gid (numeric or symbolic) of Linux owner or group of  the
       file.
              In  that  situation,  no  more file with the same Windows owner
              will be selected.
       - or no answer, when not able to define the owner or group.
              In that situation another file owned by the same  Windows  user
              or  group  may  be  selected  later  so  that  a mapping can be
              defined.

       The mappings for standard Windows users, such  as  "Administrator"  or
       "All  Users"  are  defined implicitly. As a consequence a user mapping
       should never be defined as Linux root.

       When there are no more significant files, ntfsusermap create the  map‐
       ping  file  into  the  file UserMapping in the current directory. This
       file has to be moved to the hidden directory .NTFS-3G in the  root  of
       all the NTFS file systems to be shared between Windows and Linux. This
       requires the file system to be mounted, but the created file will  not
       be  taken  into  account if not present at mount time, which means the
       file system has to be unmounted and mounted again for the new  mapping
       file to be taken into account.

OPTIONS
       No option is defined for ntfsusermap.

EXAMPLES
       Map the users defined on the Windows system present on /dev/sda1 :

              ntfsusermap /dev/sda1

       A  detailed  example,  with screen displays is available on http://jp-
       andre.pagesperso-orange.fr/ntfsusermap.html

EXIT CODES
       ntfsusermap exits with a value of 0 when no error  was  detected,  and
       with a value of 1 when an error was detected.
