NAME
       swift-object-reconstructor - OpenStack Swift EC object reconstructor


SYNOPSIS
       swift-object-reconstructor CONFIG [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Daemon  for reconstruction of EC objects. Once a pair of nodes has determined the need to replace a missing object fragment, instead of pushing over a copy like replication would do, the reconstruc‚Äê
       tor has to read in enough surviving fragments from other nodes and perform a local reconstruction before it has the correct data to push to the other node.
