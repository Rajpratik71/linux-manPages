NAME
       pnmnoraw - replaced by pnmtoplainpnm

DESCRIPTION
       This program is part of Netpbm(1)

       pnmnoraw was replaced in Netpbm 8.2 (March 2000) by pnmtoplainpnm(1) , which was obsoleted by pnmtopnm in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

       pnmtoplainpnm was actually the same program; it was just renamed to make it clear that is just a format converter.

       pnmtopnm is more general, in that it can go both directions.  pnmtopnm -plain is the same as pnmnoraw.
