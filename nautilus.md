SYNOPSIS
       nautilus [options] URIs...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  briefly the nautilus command. This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       Nautilus is the file manager for the GNOME desktop.

OPTIONS
       Nautilus follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A  summary  of  options  is  included
       below.

       -g

       --geometry=GEOMETRY
              Create the initial window with the given geometry.

       -n

       --no-default-window
              Only create windows for explicitly specified URIs.

       --no-desktop
              Do not manage the desktop â€” ignore the preference set in the preferences dialog.

       -q

       --quit Quit Nautilus.

       --help Show a summary of options.

       --version
              Show Nautilus' version.

       Other standard GNOME options not listed here are also supported.
