NAME
       dvispc - Modify a DVI file to be page-independent in specials

SYNOPSIS
       dvispc [-c] [-bvz] input_dvi_file [output_dvi_file]

       dvispc -d input_dvi_file

       dvispc -s [-p..] input_dvi_file [output_text_file]

       dvispc -a [-ltv] [-J..] [-p..] [-r..]  input_dvi_file [output_text_file]

       dvispc -x[..]  [-ltv] [-r..]  [input_text_file] output_dvi_file

DESCRIPTION
       Dvispc is a utility to modify/edit  DVI file with the following features:

           Mode option -c (default):
               modify an input DVI to be page-independent in specials (default)

           Mode option -d:
               check if an input DVI is page-independent in specials

           Mode option -s:
               show all specials in the input DVI

           Mode option -a:
               translate DVI into a Text (like dv2dt in dtl)

           Mode option -x:
               translate Text into a DVI (like dt2dv in dtl)

       (1) The main feature of dvispc is the first one, to make a page-independent DVI file.

       A  "pure"  DVI  file  must  be actually page-independent.  However in recent years, DVI files with lots of \special's (color, annotation etc.) are commonly used, and they are not
       always page-independent. In such case, for example, dviselect or dvidvi fails to preserve \special's (e.g. page color might be lost).

       The program dvispc corrects such page-"dependent" DVI files to be page-independent, which can be safely processed by dviselect or dvidvi and then properly converted to other for‚Äê
       mats such as PostScript and PDF.

       (2) To know whether such a correction is needed or not, dvispc -d will suffice.

       (3) The mode -s lists all specials found in the input DVI as-is, with a preceding number which denotes the page where it appears.  For example,

              [1]
              {color push  Black}
              {color pop}
              {color push rgb 1 0 0}
              {color pop}
              [2]
              {color push  Black}
              {color pop}

       This feature is equivalent to a program dvispecials in TeX-Guy package <http://www-masu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/%7Ekakugawa/TeX-Guy/> and dvii -s <https://ctan.org/pkg/dvii>.

       (4)  The  mode  -a  and -x correspond to dv2dt and dt2dv in the dtl (= DVI Text Language) package respectively. By default dvispc -a formats the output text in its own style, but
       DTL-compatible format is available with -t option. Also, dvispc -x can accept DTL-compatible text input.

SUPPORTED SPECIALS
       Currently dvispc supports the followings:

           dvips-compatible specials
               color push, color pop, background
           dvipdfm(x) specials
               pdf:bcolor, pdf:ecolor, pdf:bgcolor, pdf:bann, pdf:eann
           tpic specials:
               pn

       Other specials might be supported in the future if needed.
