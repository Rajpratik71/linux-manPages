NAME
       gtk-update-icon-cache - Icon theme caching utility

SYNOPSIS
       gtk-update-icon-cache [--force] [--ignore-theme-index] [--index-only |
                             --include-image-data] [--source NAME] [--quiet]
                             [--validate] PATH

DESCRIPTION
       gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmapable cache files for icon themes.

       It expects to be given the PATH to a icon theme directory containing
       an index.theme, e.g.  /usr/share/icons/hicolor, and writes a
       icon-theme.cache containing cached information about the icons in the
       directory tree below the given directory.

       GTK+ can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid
       a lot of system call and disk seek overhead when the application
       starts. Since the format of the cache files allows them to be mmaped
       shared between multiple applications, the overall memory consumption
       is reduced as well.

OPTIONS
       --force, -f
           Overwrite an existing cache file even if it appears to be
           uptodate.

       --ignore-theme-index, -t
           Don't check for the existence of index.theme in the icon theme
           directory. Without this option, gtk-update-icon-cache refuses to
           create an icon cache in a directory which does not appear to be
           the toplevel directory of an icon theme.

       --index-only, -i
           Don't include image data in the cache.

       --include-image-data
           Include image data in the cache.

       --source, -c
           Output a C header file declaring a constant NAME with the contents
           of the icon cache.

       --quiet, -q
           Turn off verbose output.

       --validate, -v
           Validate existing icon cache.
