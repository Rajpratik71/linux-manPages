SYNOPSIS
       rnano [options] [[+line[,column]] file]...

DESCRIPTION
       rnano  runs the nano editor in restricted mode.  This allows editing only the specified file or files, and doesn't allow the user access to

       In restricted mode, nano will:

       · not read any nanorc files;

       · not allow suspending;

       · not read nor write any file not specified on the command line;

       · not allow saving a file under a different name;

       · not allow appending or prepending to any file;

       · not make backup files nor do spell checking.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help

       See the nano(1) manpage for all available options.
