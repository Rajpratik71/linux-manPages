NAME
       winetricks - manage virtual windows environments using wine

SYNOPSIS
       winetricks [options] [verb ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       winetricks is an easy way to work around common problems in Wine.

       It  provides  simple commands to tweak Wine settings, download and install missing Windows DLLs and fonts, or install various games or apps
       with appropriate workarounds for the current version of wine.

       It can be used via gui or commandline.  The commandline mode is intended both for interactive use and as a building block in  fancier  wine
       frontends and in automated regression testing.

       winetricks with no arguments displays a GUI using either Zenity or Kdialog.

OPTIONS
       --force
              Don't check whether packages were already installed

       --gui  Show gui diagnostics even when driven by commandline

       -k, --keep_isos
              Cache isos (allows later installation without disc)

       --no-clean
              Don't delete temp directories (useful during debugging)

       --no-isolate
              Don't install each app or game in its own bottle

       -q, --unattended
              Don't ask any questions, just install automatically

       -r, --ddrescue
              Retry hard when caching scratched discs

       --showbroken
              Even show verbs that are currently broken in wine

       -v, --verbose
              Echo all commands as they are executed
