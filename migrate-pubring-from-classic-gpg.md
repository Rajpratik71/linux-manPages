NAME
       migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg - Migrate a public keyring from "classic" to "modern" GnuPG

SYNOPSIS
       migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg [ GPGHOMEDIR | --default ]

DESCRIPTION
       migrate-pubring-from-classic-gpg migrates the public keyring in GnuPG home directory GPGHOMEDIR
       from the "classic" keyring format to the "modern" keybox format using  GnuPG  versions  2.1  or
       2.2.

       Specifying  --default  selects  the standard GnuPG home directory (looking at $GNUPGHOME first,
       and falling back to ~/.gnupg if unset.

OPTIONS

DIAGNOSTICS

       During a migration, the tool backs up several pieces of data in a timestamped  subdirectory  of
       the GPGHOMEDIR.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GNUPGHOME Selects the GnuPG home directory when set and --default is given.

       GPG The name of the gpg executable (defaults to gpg ).
