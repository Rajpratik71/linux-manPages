NAME
       setcap - set file capabilities

SYNOPSIS
       setcap [-q] [-v] (capabilities|-|-r) filename [ ... capabilitiesN fileN ]

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  absence  of  the -v (verify) option setcap sets the capabilities of each specified filename to the capabilities specified.  The -v
       option is used to verify that the specified capabilities are currently associated with the file.

       The capabilities are specified in the form described in cap_from_text(3).

       The special capability string, '-', can be used to indicate that capabilities are read from the standard input. In such cases, the capabil‚Äê
       ity set is terminated with a blank line.

       The special capability string, '-r', is used to remove a capability set from a file.

       The -q flag is used to make the program less verbose in its output.

EXIT CODE
       The setcap program will exit with a 0 exit code if successful. On failure, the exit code is 1.
