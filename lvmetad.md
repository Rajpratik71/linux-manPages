NAME
       lvmetad — LVM metadata cache daemon

SYNOPSIS
       lvmetad [-l level[,level...]]  [-p pidfile_path] [-s socket_path] [-t timeout_value] [-f] [-h] [-V] [-?]

DESCRIPTION
       The  lvmetad  daemon  caches LVM metadata so that LVM commands can read metadata from the cache rather than scanning disks.  This can be an
       advantage because scanning disks is time consuming and may interfere with the normal work of the system.  lvmetad  can  be  a  disadvantage
       when disk event notifications from the system are unreliable.

       lvmetad  does  not read metadata from disks itself.  Instead, it relies on an LVM command, like pvscan --cache, to read metadata from disks
       and send it to lvmetad to be cached.

       New LVM disks that appear on the system must be scanned before lvmetad knows about them.  If lvmetad does not know about a disk,  then  LVM
       commands using lvmetad will also not know about it.  When disks are added or removed from the system, lvmetad must be updated.

       lvmetad  is  usually  combined with event-based system services that automatically run pvscan --cache on disks added or removed.  This way,
       the cache is automatically updated with metadata from new disks when they appear.  LVM udev rules and systemd services implement this auto‐
       mation.  Automatic scanning is usually combined with automatic activation.  For more information, see pvscan(8).

       If  lvmetad  is  started  or  restarted  after  disks have been added to the system, or if the global_filter has changed, the cache must be
       updated.  This can be done by running pvscan --cache, or it will be done automatically by the next LVM command that's run.

       When lvmetad is not used, LVM commands revert to scanning disks for LVM metadata.

       In some cases, lvmetad will be temporarily disabled while it continues running.  In this state, LVM commands will ignore the lvmetad  cache
       and  revert  to  scanning  disks.  A warning will also be printed which includes the reason why lvmetad is not being used.  The most common
       reason is the existence of duplicate PVs (lvmetad cannot cache data for duplicate PVs.)  Once duplicates have been  resolved,  the  lvmetad
       cache is can be updated with pvscan --cache and commands will return to using the cache.

       Use of lvmetad is enabled/disabled by:
       lvm.conf(5) global/use_lvmetad

       For more information on this setting, see:
       lvmconfig --withcomments global/use_lvmetad

       To ignore disks from LVM at the system level, e.g. lvmetad, pvscan use:
       lvm.conf(5) devices/global_filter

       For more information on this setting, see
       lvmconfig --withcomments devices/global_filter

OPTIONS
       To run the daemon in a test environment both the pidfile_path and the socket_path should be changed from the defaults.

       -f     Don't fork, but run in the foreground.

       -h, -? Show help information.

       -l levels
              Specify  the levels of log messages to generate as a comma separated list.  Messages are logged by syslog.  Additionally, when -f is
              given they are also sent to standard error.  Possible levels are: all, fatal, error, warn, info, wire, debug.

       -p pidfile_path
              Path to the pidfile. This overrides both the built-in default (/run/lvmetad.pid) and the environment  variable  LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE.
              This file is used to prevent more than one instance of the daemon running simultaneously.

       -s socket_path
              Path  to  the  socket  file.  This  overrides  both  the  built-in  default  (/run/lvm/lvmetad.socket)  and the environment variable
              LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET.  To communicate successfully with lvmetad, all LVM2 processes should use the same socket path.

       -t timeout_value
              The daemon may shutdown after being idle for the given time (in seconds). When the option is omitted or the value given is zero  the
              daemon never shutdowns on idle.

       -V     Display the version of lvmetad daemon.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LVM_LVMETAD_PIDFILE
              Path for the pid file.

       LVM_LVMETAD_SOCKET
              Path for the socket file.
