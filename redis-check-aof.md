NAME
       redis-check-aof - Check integrity of a Redis .AOF file

SYNOPSIS
       redis-check-aof filename

DESCRIPTION
       Redis is a key-value database. It is similar to memcached but the dataset is not volatile and other datatypes (such as lists and sets) are natively supported.

       This utility checks the integrity of a dumped .AOF file.
