NAME
       editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications

SYNTAX
       editres [ -toolkitoption ... ]

OPTIONS
       Editres accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see X(7)).  The order of the command line options is not important.

DESCRIPTION
       Editres  is  a  tool that allows users and application developers to view the full widget hierarchy of any X Toolkit application that speaks the Editres protocol.  In addition, editres will help
       the user construct resource specifications, allow the user to apply the resource to the application and view the results dynamically.  Once the  user  is  happy  with  a  resource  specification
       editres will append the resource string to the user's X Resources file.

USING EDITRES
       Editres provides a window consisting of the following four areas:

       Menu Bar                 A set of popup menus that allow you full access to editres's features.

       Panner                   The panner allows a more intuitive way to scroll the application tree display.

       Message Area             Displays information to the user about the action that editres expects of her.

       Application Widget Tree  This area will be used to display the selected application's widget tree.

       To  begin  an editres session select the Get Widget Tree menu item from the command menu.  This will change the pointer cursor to cross hair.  You should now select the application you wish look
       at by clicking on any of its windows.  If this application understands the editres protocol then editres will display the application's widget tree in its tree window.  If the  application  does
       not understand the editres protocol editres will inform you of this fact in the message area after a few seconds delay.

       Once you have a widget tree you may now select any of the other menu options. The effect of each of these is described below.

COMMANDS
       Get Widget Tree
               Allows the user to click on any application that speaks the editres protocol and receive its widget tree.

       Refresh Current Widget Tree
               Editres  only  knows  about  the widgets that exist at the present time.  Many applications create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Selecting this menu item will cause editres to ask the
               application to resend its widget tree, thus updating its information to the new state of the application.

               For example, xman only creates the widgets for its topbox when it starts up.  None of the widgets for the manual page window are created until the user actually clicks on the Manual Page
               button.   If you retrieved xman's widget tree before the the manual page is active, you may wish to refresh the widget tree after the manual page has been displayed.  This will allow you
               to also edit the manual page's resources.

       Dump Widget Tree to a File
               For documenting applications it is often useful to be able to dump the entire application widget tree to an ASCII file.  This file can then be included in the  manual  page.   When  this
               menu item is selected a popup dialog is activated.  Type the name of the file in this dialog, and either select okay, or type a carriage-return.  Editres will now dump the widget tree to
               this file.  To cancel the file dialog, select the cancel button.

       Show Resource Box
               This command will popup a resource box for the current application.  This resource box (described in detail below) will allow the user to see exactly which resources can be set  for  the
               widget  that is currently selected in the widget tree display.  Only one widget may be currently selected; if greater or fewer are selected editres will refuse to pop up the resource box
               and put an error message in the Message Area.

       Set Resource
               This command will popup a simple dialog box for setting an arbitrary resource on all selected widgets.  You must type in the resource name, as well as the value.  You can use the Tab key
               to switch between the resource name field the resource value field.

       Quit    Exits editres.

TREE COMMANDS
       The Tree menu contains several commands that allow operations to be performed on the widget tree.

       Select Widget in Client
              This  menu  item  allows  you  to select any widget in the application; editres will then highlight the corresponding element the widget tree display.  Once this menu item is selected the
              pointer cursor will again turn to a crosshair, and you must click any pointer button in the widget you wish to have displayed.  Since some widgets are fully obscured by their children, it
              is not possible to get to every widget this way, but this mechanism does give very useful feedback between the elements in the widget tree and those in the actual application.

       Select All

       Unselect All

       Invert All
              These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or invert all widgets in the widget tree.

       Select Children

       Select Parents
              These functions select the immediate parent or children of each of the currently selected widgets.

       Select Descendants

       Select Ancestors
              These functions select all parents or children of each of the currently selected widgets.  This is a recursive search.

       Show Widget Names

       Show Class Names

       Show Widget IDs

       Show Widget Windows
              When  the  tree  widget is initially displayed the labels of each widget in the tree correspond to the widget names.  These functions will cause the label of all widgets in the tree to be
              changed to show the class name, IDs, or window associated with each widget in the application.  The widget IDs, and windows are shown as hex numbers.

       In addition there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree operations.  If the input focus is over an individual widget in the tree, then that operation will only effect that  widget.   If
       the input focus is in the Tree background it will have exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu item.

       The  translation  entries  shown  may be applied to any widget in the application.  If that widget is a child of the Tree widget, then it will only affect that widget, otherwise it will have the
       same effect as the commands in the tree menu.

       Flash Active Widgets
              This command is the inverse of the Select Widget in Client command, it will show the user each widget that is currently selected in the widget tree, by flashing the  corresponding  widget
              in the application numFlashes (three by default) times in the flashColor.

              Key     Option                     Translation Entry
              -
              space   Unselect                   Select(nothing)
              w       Select                     Select(widget)
              s       Select                     Select(all)
              i       Invert                     Select(invert)
              c       Select Children            Select(children)
              d       Select Descendants         Select(descendants)
              p       Select Parent              Select(parent)
              a       Select Ancestors           Select(ancestors)
              N       Show Widget Names          Relabel(name)
              C       Show Class Names           Relabel(class)
              I       Show Widget IDs            Relabel(id)
              W       Show Widget Windows        Relabel(window)
              T       Toggle Widget/Class Name   Relabel(toggle)

              Clicking button 1 on a widget adds it to the set of selected widgets.  Clicking button 2 on a widget deselects all other widgets and then selects just that widget.  Clicking button 3 on a
              widget toggles its label between the widget's instance name the widget's class name.

USING THE RESOURCE BOX
       The resource box contains five different areas.  Each of the areas, as they appear on the screen, from top to bottom will be discussed.

       The Resource Line
              This area at the top of the resource box shows the current resource name exactly as it would appear if you were to save it to a file or apply it.

       The Widget Names and Classes
              This area allows you to select exactly which widgets this resource will apply to.  The area contains four lines, the first contains the name of the selected widget and all its  ancestors,
              and  the  more  restrictive dot (.) separator.  The second line contains less specific the Class names of each widget, and well as the less restrictive star (*) separator.  The third line
              contains a set of special buttons called Any Widget which will generalize this level to match any widget.  The last line contains a set of special buttons called Any  Widget  Chain  which
              will turn the single level into something that matches zero or more levels.

              The initial state of this area is the most restrictive, using the resource names and the dot separator.  By selecting the other buttons in this area you can ease the restrictions to allow
              more and more widgets to match the specification.  The extreme case is to select all the Any Widget Chain buttons, which will match every widget in the application.   As you  select  dif‚Äê
              ferent buttons the tree display will update to show you exactly which widgets will be effected by the current resource specification.

       Normal and Constraint Resources
              The next area allows you to select the name of the normal or constraint resources you wish to set.  Some widgets may not have constraint resources, so that area will not appear.

       Resource Value
              This  next  area  allows you to enter the resource value.  This value should be entered exactly as you would type a line into your resource file.  Thus it should contain no unescaped new-
              lines.  There are a few special character sequences for this file:

              \n - This will be replaced with a newline.

              \### - Where # is any octal digit.  This will be replaced with a single byte that contains this sequence interpreted as an octal number.  For example, a value containing a NULL  byte  can
              be stored by specifying \000.

              \<new-line> - This will compress to nothing.

              \\ - This will compress to a single backslash.

       Command Area
              This area contains several command buttons, described in this section.

       Set Save File
              This  button  allows  the  user  to  modify  file that the resources will be saved to.  This button will bring up a dialog box that will ask you for a filename; once the filename has been
              entered, either hit carriage-return or click on the okay button.  To pop down the dialog box without changing the save file, click the cancel button.

       Save   This button will append the resource line described above to the end of the current save file.  If no save file has been set the Set Save File dialog box will be popped up to  prompt  the
              user for a filename.

       Apply  This  button  attempts  to  perform a XtSetValues call on all widgets that match the resource line described above.  The value specified is applied directly to all matching widgets.  This
              behavior is an attempt to give a dynamic feel to the resource editor.  Since this feature allows users to put an application in states it may not be willing to handle,  a  hook  has  been
              provided to allow specific applications to block these SetValues requests (see Blocking Editres Requests below).

              Unfortunately  due  to  design  constraints  imposed on the widgets by the X Toolkit and the Resource Manager, trying to coerce an inherently static system into dynamic behavior can cause
              strange results.  There is no guarantee that the results of an apply will be the same as what will happen when you save the value and restart the application.  This functionality is  pro‚Äê
              vided  to  try to give you a rough feel for what your changes will accomplish, and the results obtained should be considered suspect at best.  Having said that, this is one of the neatest
              features of editres, and I strongly suggest that you play with it, and see what it can do.

       Save and Apply
              This button combines the Save and Apply actions described above into one button.

       Popdown Resource Box
              This button will remove the resource box from the display.

BLOCKING EDITRES REQUESTS
       The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget set.  This allows all applications that are linked against Xaw to be able to speak to the resource editor.  While this  provides  great
       flexibility,  and  is  a  useful  tool, it can quite easily be abused.  It is therefore possible for any Xaw application to specify a value for the editresBlock resource described below, to keep
       editres from divulging information about its internals, or to disable the SetValues part of the protocol.

       editresBlock (Class EditresBlock)
               Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to impose on the editres protocol.

       The accepted values are:

       all            Block all requests.

       setValues      Block all SetValues requests.  As this is the only editres request that actually modifies the application, this is in effect stating that the application is read-only.

       none           Allow all editres requests.

       Remember that these resources are set on any Xaw application, not editres.  They allow individual applications to keep all or some of the requests editres makes from ever succeeding.  Of course,
       editres  is  also  an  Xaw application, so it may also be viewed and modified by editres (rather recursive, I know), these commands can be blocked by setting the editresBlock resource on editres
       itself.

RESOURCES
       For editres the available application resources are:

       numFlashes (Class NumFlashes)
               Specifies the number of times the widgets in the application will be flashed when the Show Active Widgets command in invoked.

       flashTime (Class FlashTime)
               Amount of time between the flashes described above.

       flashColor (Class flashColor)
               Specifies the color used to flash application widgets.  A bright color should be used that will immediately draw your attention to the area being flashed, such as red or yellow.

       saveResourcesFile (Class SaveResourcesFile)
               This is the file the resource line will be append to when the Save button activated in the resource box.

WIDGETS
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose editres.  In the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.   The  widget  class
       name is given first, followed by the widget instance name.
