SYNOPSIS
       cdda2ogg

DESCRIPTION
       cdda2ogg  is  a simple script that uses the icedax <fileprefix> command to extract all audio tracks with the icedax <fileprefix> command and encode them using the ogg123 encoder. The scripts are not
       intended to be full-featured music archiving programs, but only for quick storing of few audio data.  It does not use databases like CDDB or have any extra features. You may look at  icedax  if  you
       need them.

       ogg123 is provided by the vorbis-tools which needs to be installed separately.  See www.ogg.org for more information.
