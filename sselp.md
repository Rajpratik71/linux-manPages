NAME
       sselp - simple X selection printer

       sselp [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       sselp  prints  the  X selection to standard out.  If there is no X client owning the selection it just exits.  Useful for scripts where you
       can query the X selection without pressing mouse Button2 in cumbersome ways.
