BLOCKDEV(8)                              System Administration                             BLOCKDEV(8)

NAME
       blockdev - call block device ioctls from the command line

SYNOPSIS
       blockdev [-q] [-v] command [command...] device [device...]
       blockdev --report [device...]
       blockdev -h|-V

DESCRIPTION
       The utility blockdev allows one to call block device ioctls from the command line.

OPTIONS
       -q     Be quiet.

       -v     Be verbose.

       --report
              Print  a  report  for  the specified device. It is possible to give multiple devices. If
              none is given, all devices which appear in /proc/partitions are  shown.  Note  that  the
              partition StartSec is in 512-byte sectors.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print version and exit.

COMMANDS
       It is possible to give multiple devices and multiple commands.

       --flushbufs
              Flush buffers.

       --getalignoff
              Get alignment offset.

       --getbsz
              Print  blocksize in bytes.  This size does not describe device topology.  It's size used
              internally by kernel and it maybe modified (for example) by filesystem driver on mount.

       --getdiscardzeroes
              Get discard zeroes support status.

       --getfra
              Get filesystem readahead in 512-byte sectors.

       --getiomin
              Get minimum I/O size.

       --getioopt
              Get optimal I/O size.

       --getmaxsect
              Get max sectors per request

       --getpbsz
              Get physical block (sector) size.

       --getra
              Print readahead (in 512-byte sectors).

       --getro
              Get read-only. Print 1 if the device is read-only, 0 otherwise.

       --getsize64
              Print device size in bytes.

       --getsize
              Print device size (32-bit!) in sectors. Deprecated in favor of the --getsz option.

       --getss
              Print logical sector size in bytes – usually 512.

       --getsz
              Get size in 512-byte sectors.

       --rereadpt
              Reread partition table

       --setbsz bytes
              Set blocksize. Note that the block size is specific to the current file descriptor open‐
              ing  the block device, so the change of block size only persists for as long as blockdev
              has the device open, and is lost once blockdev exits.

       --setfra sectors
              Set filesystem readahead (same like --setra on 2.6 kernels).

       --setra sectors
              Set readahead (in 512-byte sectors).

       --setro
              Set read-only. The currently active access to the device may  not  be  affected  by  the
              change.  For example filesystem already mounted in read-write mode will not be affected.
              The change applies after remount.

       --setrw
              Set read-write.
