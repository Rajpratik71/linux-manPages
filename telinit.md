TELINIT(8)                         telinit                         TELINIT(8)

NAME
       telinit - Change SysV runlevel

SYNOPSIS
       telinit [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       telinit may be used to change the SysV system runlevel. Since the
       concept of SysV runlevels is obsolete the runlevel requests will be
       transparently translated into systemd unit activation requests.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --no-wall
           Do not send wall message before reboot/halt/power-off.

       The following commands are understood:

       0
           Power-off the machine. This is translated into an activation
           request for poweroff.target and is equivalent to systemctl
           poweroff.

       6
           Reboot the machine. This is translated into an activation request
           for reboot.target and is equivalent to systemctl reboot.

       2, 3, 4, 5
           Change the SysV runlevel. This is translated into an activation
           request for runlevel2.target, runlevel3.target, ... and is
           equivalent to systemctl isolate runlevel2.target, systemctl
           isolate runlevel3.target, ...

       1, s, S
           Change into system rescue mode. This is translated into an
           activation request for rescue.target and is equivalent to
           systemctl rescue.

       q, Q
           Reload daemon configuration. This is equivalent to systemctl
           daemon-reload.

       u, U
           Serialize state, reexecute daemon and deserialize state again.
           This is equivalent to systemctl daemon-reexec.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

NOTES
       This is a legacy command available for compatibility only. It should
       not be used anymore, as the concept of runlevels is obsolete.
