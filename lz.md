NAME
       lz - gunzips and shows a listing of a gzip'd tar'd archive

SYNOPSIS
       lz file

DESCRIPTION
       lz  provides  a listing of a gzip'd tar'd archive, that is a tar(1) archive compressed with the gzip(1) utility.  It is not strictly neces‚Äê
       sary on Debian GNU/Linux, because the GNU tar(1) program provides the same capability with the command

       tar -tzf file

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package for other platforms and is retained here for completeness.
