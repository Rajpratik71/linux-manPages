BWRAP(1)                        User Commands                        BWRAP(1)

NAME
       bwrap - container setup utility

SYNOPSIS
       bwrap [OPTION...] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       bwrap is a privileged helper for container setup. You are unlikely to
       use it directly from the commandline, although that is possible.

       It works by creating a new, completely empty, filesystem namespace
       where the root is on a tmpfs that is invisible from the host, and
       which will be automatically cleaned up when the last process exists.
       You can then use commandline options to construct the root filesystem
       and process environment for the command to run in the namespace.

       By default, bwrap creates a new mount namespace for the sandbox.
       Optionally it also sets up new user, ipc, pid, network and uts
       namespaces (but note the user namespace is required if bwrap is not
       installed setuid root). The application in the sandbox can be made to
       run with a different UID and GID.

       If needed (e.g. when using a PID namespace) bwrap is running a minimal
       pid 1 process in the sandbox that is responsible for reaping zombies.
       It also detects when the initial application process (pid 2) dies and
       reports its exit status back to the original spawner. The pid 1
       process exits to clean up the sandbox when there are no other
       processes in the sandbox left.

OPTIONS
       When options are used multiple times, the last option wins, unless
       otherwise specified.

       General options:

       --help
           Print help and exit

       --version
           Print version

       --args FD
           Parse nul-separated arguments from the given file descriptor. This
           option can be used multiple times to parse options from multiple
           sources.

       Options related to kernel namespaces:

       --unshare-user
           Create a new user namespace

       --unshare-user-try
           Create a new user namespace if possible else skip it

       --unshare-ipc
           Create a new ipc namespace

       --unshare-pid
           Create a new pid namespace

       --unshare-net
           Create a new network namespace

       --unshare-uts
           Create a new uts namespace

       --unshare-cgroup
           Create a new cgroup namespace

       --unshare-cgroup-try
           Create a new cgroup namespace if possible else skip it

       --unshare-all
           Unshare all possible namespaces. Currently equivalent with:
           --unshare-user-try --unshare-ipc --unshare-pid --unshare-net
           --unshare-uts --unshare-cgroup-try

       --uid UID
           Use a custom user id in the sandbox (requires --unshare-user)

       --gid GID
           Use a custom group id in the sandbox (requires --unshare-user)

       --hostname HOSTNAME
           Use a custom hostname in the sandbox (requires --unshare-uts)

       Options about environment setup:

       --chdir DIR
           Change directory to DIR

       --setenv VAR VALUE
           Set an environment variable

       --unsetenv VAR
           Unset an environment variable

       Options for monitoring the sandbox from the outside:

       --lock-file DEST
           Take a lock on DEST while the sandbox is running. This option can
           be used multiple times to take locks on multiple files.

       --sync-fd FD
           Keep this file descriptor open while the sandbox is running

       Filesystem related options. These are all operations that modify the
       filesystem directly, or mounts stuff in the filesystem. These are
       applied in the order they are given as arguments. Any missing parent
       directories that are required to create a specified destination are
       automatically created as needed.

       --bind SRC DEST
           Bind mount the host path SRC on DEST

       --dev-bind SRC DEST
           Bind mount the host path SRC on DEST, allowing device access

       --ro-bind SRC DEST
           Bind mount the host path SRC readonly on DEST

       --remount-ro DEST
           Remount the path DEST as readonly. It works only on the specified
           mount point, without changing any other mount point under the
           specified path

       --proc DEST
           Mount procfs on DEST

       --dev DEST
           Mount new devtmpfs on DEST

       --tmpfs DEST
           Mount new tmpfs on DEST

       --mqueue DEST
           Mount new mqueue on DEST

       --dir DEST
           Create a directory at DEST

       --file FD DEST
           Copy from the file descriptor FD to DEST

       --bind-data FD DEST
           Copy from the file descriptor FD to a file which is bind-mounted
           on DEST

       --ro-bind-data FD DEST
           Copy from the file descriptor FD to a file which is bind-mounted
           readonly on DEST

       --symlink SRC DEST
           Create a symlink at DEST with target SRC

       Lockdown options:

       --seccomp FD
           Load and use seccomp rules from FD. The rules need to be in the
           form of a compiled eBPF program, as generated by
           seccomp_export_bpf.

       --exec-label LABEL
           Exec Label from the sandbox. On an SELinux system you can specify
           the SELinux context for the sandbox process(s).

       --file-label LABEL
           File label for temporary sandbox content. On an SELinux system you
           can specify the SELinux context for the sandbox content.

       --block-fd FD
           Block the sandbox on reading from FD until some data is available.

       --userns-block-fd FD
           Do not initialize the user namespace but wait on FD until it is
           ready. This allow external processes (like newuidmap/newgidmap) to
           setup the user namespace before it is used by the sandbox process.

       --info-fd FD
           Write information in JSON format about the sandbox to FD.

       --new-session
           Create a new terminal session for the sandbox (calls setsid()).
           This disconnects the sandbox from the controlling terminal which
           means the sandbox can't for instance inject input into the
           terminal.

           Note: In a general sandbox, if you don't use --new-session, it is
           recommended to use seccomp to disallow the TIOCSTI ioctl,
           otherwise the application can feed keyboard input to the terminal.

       --die-with-parent
           Ensures child process (COMMAND) dies when bwrap's parent dies.
           Kills (SIGKILL) all bwrap sandbox processes in sequence from
           parent to child including COMMAND process when bwrap or bwrap's
           parent dies. See prctl, PR_SET_PDEATHSIG.

       --as-pid-1
           Do not create a process with PID=1 in the sandbox to reap child
           processes.

       --cap-add CAP
           Add the specified capability when running as privileged user. It
           accepts the special value ALL to add all the permitted caps.

       --cap-drop CAP
           Drop the specified capability when running as privileged user. It
           accepts the special value ALL to drop all the caps. By default no
           caps are left in the sandboxed process. The --cap-add and
           --cap-drop options are processed in the order they are specified
           on the command line. Please be careful to the order they are
           specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME
           Used as the cwd in the sandbox if --cwd has not been explicitly
           specified and the current cwd is not present inside the sandbox.
           The --setenv option can be used to override the value that is used
           here.

EXIT STATUS
       The bwrap command returns the exit status of the initial application
       process (pid 2 in the sandbox).
