NAME
       gst-install - installs missing GStreamer plugins

SYNOPSIS
       gst-install [OPTIONS] plugin ...

DESCRIPTION
       Gst-install  makes  use of the PackageKit session D-Bus interface to install missing GStreamer plugins, e.g. encoders, decoders or URI han‚Äê
       dlers. It isn't supposed to be executed directly but instead by the gst_install_plugins_async  and  gst_install_plugins  functions  of  the
       GStreamer base library gstpbutilsinstallplugins.

       PackageKit  or  the  alternative session-installer implementation will handle the complete installation process with confirmation, progress
       and error dialogs.

       See the documentation of gstpbutilsinstallplugins for the argument construction and exit states.

OPTIONS
       --transient-for
              The X Window ID of the window which should be used as parents for the dialogs

DIAGNOSTICS
       None yet.
