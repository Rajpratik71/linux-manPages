NAME
       rpmgraph - Display RPM Package Dependency Graph

SYNOPSIS
       rpmgraph PACKAGE_FILE ...

DESCRIPTION
       rpmgraph  uses PACKAGE_FILE arguments to generate a package dependency graph. Each PACKAGE_FILE
       argument is read and added to an rpm transaction set. The elements of the transaction  set  are
       partially  ordered using a topological sort. The partially ordered elements are then printed to
       standard output.

       Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and edges in the directed graph point  to  the
       parent  of each node. The parent node is defined as the last predecessor of a package when par‚Äê
       tially ordered using the package dependencies as a relation. That means that the  parent  of  a
       given package is the package's last prerequisite.

       The  output is in dot(1) directed graph format, and can be displayed or printed using the dotty
       graph editor from the graphviz package.  There are no rpmgraph specific  options,  only  common
       rpm options.  See the rpmgraph usage message for what is currently implemented.
