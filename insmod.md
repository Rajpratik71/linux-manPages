INSMOD(8)                           insmod                          INSMOD(8)

NAME
       insmod - Simple program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel

SYNOPSIS
       insmod [filename] [module options...]

DESCRIPTION
       insmod is a trivial program to insert a module into the kernel. Most
       users will want to use modprobe(8) instead, which is more clever and
       can handle module dependencies.

       Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the work of
       trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel, the dmesg
       usually gives more information about errors.
