NAME
       ntfsrecover - Recover updates committed by Windows on an NTFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsrecover [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsrecover  applies  to the metadata the updates which were requested
       on Windows but could not be completed because they were interrupted by
       some event such as a power failure, a hardware crash, a software crash
       or the device being unplugged.  Doing so, the file system is  restored
       to a consistent state, however updates to user data may still be lost.

       Updating  the  file system generally requires updating several records
       which should all be made for the file system to  be  kept  consistent.
       For  instance,  creating a new file requires reserving an inode number
       (set a bit in a bit map), creating a file record (store the file  name
       and  file attributes), and registering the file in a directory (locate
       the file from some path). When an unfortunate event occurs, and one of
       these  updates  could  be done but not all of them, the file system is
       left inconsistent.

       A group of updates which have all to be done to  preserve  consistency
       is  called  a transaction, and the end of updates within a transaction
       is called the commitment of the transaction.

       To protect from unfortunate events, Windows first logs  in  a  special
       file  all the metadata update requests without applying any, until the
       commitment is known. If the event occurs  before  the  commitment,  no
       update  has  been made and the file system is consistent. If the event
       occurs after the update, the log file can be analyzed  later  and  the
       transactions  which were committed can be executed again, thus restor‐
       ing the integrity of the file system.

       ntfsrecover similarly examines the log file and  applies  the  updates
       within committed transactions which could not be done by Windows.

       Currently, ntfs-3g does not log updates, so ntfsrecover cannot be used
       to restore consistency after an unfortunate event occurred  while  the
       file system was updated by Linux.

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary of all the options that ntfsrecover accepts. The
       normal usage is to use no option at all, as most of these options  are
       oriented towards developers needs.

       Nearly  all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is pre‐
       ceded by - and the long name is preceded by  --.   Any  single  letter
       options,  that  don't  take an argument, can be combined into a single
       command, e.g.  -bv is equivalent to -b -v.  Long named options can  be
       abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -b, --backward
              Examine  the actions described in the logfile backward from the
              latest one to the earliest one  without  applying  any  update.
              This  may  encompass records generated during several sessions,
              and when Windows is restarted, it often does not restart  writ‐
              ing  where  it  ended  the  previous  session, so this leads to
              errors and bad sequencing when examining the full log file.

       -c, --clusters CLUSTER-RANGE
              Restrict the output generated when using options -b -f -u -p to
              the  actions  operating  on  a cluster within the given cluster
              range.  CLUSTER-RANGE is defined by the first and last  cluster
              numbers   separated  by  a  hyphen,  for  instance  100-109  or
              0x3e8-0x3ff. A single number  means  restricting  to  a  single
              cluster. The first four log blocks have a special role and they
              are always shown.

       -f, --forward NUM
              Examine the actions described in the logfile forward  from  the
              first  one  to the last one without applying any update. As the
              log file is reused circularly, the first one is  generally  not
              the earliest. Moreover when Windows is restarted, it often does
              not restart writing where it ended the previous  sessions,  and
              this leads to errors when examining a log file generated during
              several sessions.

       -h, --help
              Show some help information.

       -k, --kill-fast-restart
              When Windows has been interrupted with fast restart mode  acti‐
              vated,  part  of  pending changes are kept in the Windows cache
              and only the same Windows version can recover them. This option
              can  be  used to apply the changes recorded in the log file and
              drop the ones in the Windows cache.  This is dangerous and  may
              cause loss of data.

       -n, --no-action
              Do  not  apply  any modification, useful when using the options
              -p, -s or -u.

       -p, --play COUNT
              Undo COUNT transaction sets and redo a single one,  a  transac‐
              tion  set being all transactions between two consecutive check‐
              points. This is useful for replaying some  transaction  in  the
              past.  As  a  few  actions are not undoable, this is not always
              possible.

       -r, --range BLOCK-RANGE
              Examine the actions described in the logfile forward restricted
              to  the  requested  log  file  block range without applying any
              update. The first four log blocks have a special role and  they
              are always examined.

       -s, --sync
              Sync  the  file  system by applying the committed actions which
              have not been synced previously. This is  the  default  option,
              used  when  none  of  the  options  -n,  -f,  -r, -p and -u are
              present.

              The option -s can be repeated to request applying the committed
              actions  mentioned in the obsolete restart page. This is useful
              for testing the situations where the latest restart page cannot
              be read though it can actually be read.

       -t, --transactions COUNT
              Display  the transaction parameters when examining the log file
              with one of the options --forward, --backward or --range.

       -u, --undo COUNT
              Undo COUNT transaction sets, thus resetting the file system  to
              some checkpoint in the past, a transaction set being all trans‐
              actions between two consecutive checkpoints. As a  few  actions
              are not undoable, this is not always possible.

       -v, --verbose
              Display  more  debug/warning/error messages. This option may be
              used twice to display even more information.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license of ntfsrecover.

EXAMPLES
       Sync an NTFS volume on /dev/sda1.

              ntfsrecover -s /dev/sda1

       Display all actions which updated a cluster in range 100 to 119 :

              ntfsrecover --verbose --backward --clusters=100-119 /dev/sda1
