NAME
       ecryptfs-recover-private - find and mount any encrypted private directories

SYNOPSIS
       ecryptfs-recover-private [--rw] [encrypted private dir]

DESCRIPTION
       This utility is intended to help eCryptfs recover data from their encrypted home or encrypted private partitions.  It is useful to run this
       from a LiveISO or a recovery image.  It must run under sudo(8) or with root permission, in order to search the filesystem and  perform  the
       mounts.

       The  program  can take a target encrypted directory on the command line.  If unspecified, the utility will search the entire system looking
       for encrypted private directories, as configured by ecryptfs-setup-private(1).

       If an encrypted directory and a wrapped-passphrase file are found, the user is prompted for the login (wrapping) passphrase, the  keys  are
       inserted into the keyring, and the data is decrypted and mounted.

       If  no  wrapped-passphrase file is found, the user will be prompted for their mount passphrase.  This passphrase is typically 32 characters
       of [0-9a-f].  All users are prompted to urgently record this randomly generated passphrase when they first setup  their  encrypted  private
       directory.

       The destination mount of the decrypted data is a temporary directory, in the form of /tmp/ecryptfs.XXXXXXXX.

       By default, the mount will be read-only.  To mount with read and write permission, add the --rw parameter.
