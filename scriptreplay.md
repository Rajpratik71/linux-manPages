NAME
       scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information

SYNOPSIS
       scriptreplay [options] [-t] timingfile [typescript [divisor]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

       The  replay  simply  displays  the  information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.  Since the same information is simply being displayed,
       scriptreplay is only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters in the typescript may be  interpreted  dif‐
       ferently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is sending its output.

       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to standard error if it is run with the -t parameter.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named typescript, but other filenames may be specified, as the second parameter or with option -s.

       If  the  third  parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier.  For example, a speed-up of 2 makes scriptreplay go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower
       than the original session.

OPTIONS
       The first three options will override old-style arguments.

       -t, --timing file
              File containing script's timing output.

       -s, --typescript file
              File containing script's terminal output.

       -d, --divisor number
              Speed up the replay displaying this number of times.  The argument is a floating point number.  It's called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor.

       -m, --maxdelay number
              Set the maximum delay between transcript updates to number of seconds.  The argument is a floating point number.  This can be used to avoid long pauses in the transcript replay.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

EXAMPLE
       % script --timing=file.tm script.out
       Script started, file is script.out
       % ls
       <etc, etc>
       % exit
       Script done, file is script.out
       % scriptreplay --timing file.tm --typescript script.out
