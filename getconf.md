PROLOG

NAME
       getconf - get configuration values

SYNOPSIS
       getconf [ -v specification ] system_var

       getconf [ -v specification ] path_var pathname


DESCRIPTION
       In the first synopsis form, the getconf utility shall write to the standard output the value of the variable specified by the system_var operand.

       In the second synopsis form, the getconf utility shall write to the standard output the value of the variable specified by the path_var operand for the path specified by the pathname operand.

       The value of each configuration variable shall be determined as if it were obtained by calling the function from which it is defined to be available by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 or by  the
       System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (see the OPERANDS section). The value shall reflect conditions in the current operating environment.

OPTIONS
       The getconf utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

       The following option shall be supported:

       -v  specification

              Indicate  a  specific  specification  and  version  for which configuration variables shall be determined. If this option is not specified, the values returned correspond to an implementation
              default conforming compilation environment.

       If the command:


              getconf _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32

       does not write "-1\n" or "undefined\n" to standard output, then commands of the form:


              getconf -v POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32 ...

       determine values for configuration variables corresponding to the POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32 compilation environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.

       If the command:


              getconf _POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG

       does not write "-1\n" or "undefined\n" to standard output, then commands of the form:


              getconf -v POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG ...

       determine values for configuration variables corresponding to the POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG compilation environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.

       If the command:


              getconf _POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64

       does not write "-1\n" or "undefined\n" to standard output, then commands of the form:


              getconf -v POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 ...

       determine values for configuration variables corresponding to the POSIX_V6_LP64_OFF64 compilation environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.

       If the command:


              getconf _POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG

       does not write "-1\n" or "undefined\n" to standard output, then commands of the form:


              getconf -v POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG ...

       determine values for configuration variables corresponding to the POSIX_V6_LPBIG_OFFBIG compilation environment specified in c99, the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION.


OPERANDS
       The following operands shall be supported:

       path_var
              A name of a configuration variable. All of the variables in the Variable column of the table in the DESCRIPTION of the  fpathconf()  function  defined  in  the  System  Interfaces  volume  of
              IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, without the enclosing braces, shall be supported.  The implementation may add other local variables.

              A name of a configuration variable. All of the following variables shall be supported:

               * The  names in the Variable column of the table in the DESCRIPTION of the sysconf() function in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, except for the entries corresponding to
                 _SC_CLK_TCK, _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX, and _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX, without the enclosing braces.

              For compatibility with earlier versions, the following variable names shall also be supported:

STDIN
       Not used.

INPUT FILES
       None.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of getconf:

       LANG   Provide  a  default  value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables
              for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_CTYPE
              Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determine the locale that should be used to affect the format and contents of diagnostic messages written to standard error.

       NLSPATH
              Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES .


ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
       Default.

STDOUT
       If the specified variable is defined on the system and its value is described to be available from the confstr() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,  its  value
       shall be written in the following format:


              "%s\n", <value>

       Otherwise, if the specified variable is defined on the system, its value shall be written in the following format:


              "%d\n", <value>

       If the specified variable is valid, but is undefined on the system, getconf shall write using the following format:


              "undefined\n"

       If the variable name is invalid or an error occurs, nothing shall be written to standard output.

STDERR
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

OUTPUT FILES
       None.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
       None.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0     The specified variable is valid and information about its current state was written successfully.

       >0     An error occurred.


CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
       Default.

       The following sections are informative.

APPLICATION USAGE
       None.

EXAMPLES
       The following example illustrates the value of {NGROUPS_MAX}:


              getconf NGROUPS_MAX

       The following example illustrates the value of {NAME_MAX} for a specific directory:


              getconf NAME_MAX /usr

       The following example shows how to deal more carefully with results that might be unspecified:


              if value=$(getconf PATH_MAX /usr); then
                  if [ "$value" = "undefined" ]; then
                      echo PATH_MAX in /usr is infinite.
                  else
                      echo PATH_MAX in /usr is $value.
                  fi
              else
                  echo Error in getconf.
              fi

       Note that:


              sysconf(_SC_POSIX_C_BIND);

       and:


              system("getconf POSIX2_C_BIND");

       in a C program could give different answers. The sysconf() call supplies a value that corresponds to the conditions when the program was either compiled or executed, depending on the implementation;
       the system() call to getconf always supplies a value corresponding to conditions when the program is executed.

RATIONALE
       The original need for this utility, and for the confstr() function, was to provide a way of finding the configuration-defined default value for the PATH environment variable. Since PATH can be modi‚Äê
       fied  by the user to include directories that could contain utilities replacing the standard utilities, shell scripts need a way to determine the system-supplied PATH environment variable value that
       contains the correct search path for the standard utilities. It was later suggested that access to the other variables described in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 could also be useful to appli‚Äê
       cations.

       This functionality of getconf would not be adequately subsumed by another command such as:


              grep var /etc/conf

       because such a strategy would provide correct values for neither those variables that can vary at runtime, nor those that can vary depending on the path.

       Early  proposal  versions of getconf specified exit status 1 when the specified variable was valid, but not defined on the system. The output string "undefined" is now used to specify this case with
       exit code 0 because so many things depend on an exit code of zero when an invoked utility is successful.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
