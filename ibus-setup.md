ADVANCED
       Use system keyboard layout
              If this option is enabled, use your system keymap  instead  and
              IBus does not change it with any input method engines. The sys‐
              tem keymap is decided  by  your  desktop  session.  IBus  calls
              setxkbmap (1) command internally to set the selected keymap and
              override the system keymap if this options  is  disabled.   You
              can check the current keymap with setxkbmap -query command.

       Share the same input method among all applications
              If  this  option  is  disabled,  You  can choose an input metod
              engine by input context.
