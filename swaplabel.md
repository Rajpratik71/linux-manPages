NAME
       swaplabel - print or change the label or UUID of a swap area

SYNOPSIS
       swaplabel [-L label] [-U UUID] device

DESCRIPTION
       swaplabel will display or change the label or UUID of a swap partition located on device (or regular file).

       If the optional arguments -L and -U are not given, swaplabel will simply display the current swap-area label and UUID of device.

       If  an optional argument is present, then swaplabel will change the appropriate value on device.  These values can also be set during swap creation using mkswap(8).  The swaplabel utility allows
       to change the label or UUID on an actively used swap device.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -L, --label label
              Specify a new label for the device.  Swap partition labels can be at most 16 characters long.  If label is longer than 16 characters, swaplabel will truncate it and print a  warning  mes‚Äê
              sage.

       -U, --uuid UUID
              Specify a new UUID for the device.  The  UUID must be in the standard 8-4-4-4-12 character format, such as is output by uuidgen(1).
