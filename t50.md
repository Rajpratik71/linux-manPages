NAME
       T50 - network packet injector

SYNOPSIS
       t50 [OPTION]...  host[/CIDR]

DESCRIPTION
       Experimental mixed packet injector tool.

       T50 must to be executed as root.

OPTIONS
       host[/CIDR]
              The host address can be informed in one of two formats: IP address or URI name. In both cases the CIDR can be informed following the
              host name or IP using '/' as separator.  Partial IP addresses can be informed. To do so, the user must exclude one or  more  octects
              (ex:  192.168 for 192.168.0.0/16 - "192.168." is an invalid host because of the last '.').  When using a partial IP address T50 will
              calculate CIDR automatically (8, 16 or 24 bits, if the first, second or thrid octect is informed, respectively).

       --threshold NUM
              Number of packets to send (default 1000).

       --flood
              Superseds the threshold.

       -B, --bogus-csum
              Bogus checksum.

       --turbo
              Extend performance (create child process).

       -s, --saddr ADDR
              IP source address (default RANDOM).

       --help Display full help.

EXAMPLES
       Send 500 packets to a single target:

              # t50 --threshold 500 192.168.0.100

       Flood test:

              $ t50 --flood 192.168.0.100
