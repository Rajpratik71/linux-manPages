DESCRIPTION
       The dmstats program manages IO statistics regions for devices that use
       the device-mapper driver. Statistics regions may be created,  deleted,
       listed and reported on using the tool.

       The first argument to dmstats is a command.

       The  second  argument is the device name, uuid or major and minor num‐
       bers.

       Further options permit the selection of regions,  output  format  con‐
       trol, and reporting behaviour.

       When  no  device  argument is given dmstats will by default operate on
       all device-mapper devices present.  The  create  and  delete  commands
       require the use of --alldevices when used in this way.

OPTIONS
       --alias name
              Specify an alias name for a group.

       --alldevices
              If no device arguments are given allow operation on all devices
              when creating or deleting regions.

       --allprograms
              Include regions from all program IDs for list and report opera‐
              tions.

       --allregions
              Include all present regions for commands that normally accept a
              single region identifier.

       --area
              When peforming a list or report, include objects of  type  area
              in the results.

       --areas nr_areas
              Specify  the  number of statistics areas to create within a new
              region.

       --areasize area_size[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T|p|P|e|E]
              Specify the size of areas into which a  new  region  should  be
              divided.   An   optional  suffix  selects  units  of:  (b)ytes,
              (s)ectors, (k)ilobytes, (m)egabytes, (g)igabytes,  (t)erabytes,
              (p)etabytes,  (e)xabytes.   Capitalise to use multiples of 1000
              (S.I.) instead of 1024.

       --clear
              When printing statistics counters, also atomically  reset  them
              to zero.

       --count count
              Specify the iteration count for repeating reports. If the count
              argument is zero reports will continue to repeat  until  inter‐
              rupted.

       --group
              When  peforming a list or report, include objects of type group
              in the results.

       --filemap
              Instead of creating regions on a device as specified by command
              line  options,  open the file found at each file_path argument,
              and create regions corresponding to the locations  of  the  on-
              disk extents allocated to the file(s).

       --nomonitor
              Disable  the  dmfilemapd  daemon  when creating new file mapped
              groups. Normally the device-mapper filemap  monitoring  daemon,
              dmfilemapd, is started for each file mapped group to update the
              set of regions as the file changes on-disk: use of this  option
              disables this behaviour.

              Regions   in   the   group   may  still  be  updated  with  the
              update_filemap command, or by starting the daemon manually.

       --follow follow_mode
              Specify the dmfilemapd file following mode. The file map  moni‐
              toring  daemon can monitor files in two distinct ways: the mode
              affects the behaviour of the daemon when a file under  monitor‐
              ing  is renamed or unlinked, and the conditions which cause the
              daemon to terminate.

              The follow_mode argument is either  "inode",  for  follow-inode
              mode, or "path", for follow-path.

              If  follow-inode  mode  is  used, the daemon will hold the file
              open, and  continue  to  update  regions  from  the  same  file
              descriptor.  This  means  that  the mapping will follow rename,
              move (within the same file system), and unlink operations. This
              mode is useful if the file is expected to be moved, renamed, or
              unlinked while it is being monitored.

              In follow-inode mode, the daemon will exit once it detects that
              the  file has been unlinked and it is the last holder of a ref‐
              erence to it.

              If follow-path is used, the daemon will  re-open  the  provided
              path  on  each  monitoring iteration. This means that the group
              will be updated to reflect a new file being moved to  the  same
              path  as  the original file. This mode is useful for files that
              are expected to be updated via unlink and rename.

              In follow-path mode, the  daemon  will  exit  if  the  file  is
              removed and not replaced within a brief tolerance interval.

              In either mode, the daemon exits automatically if the monitored
              group is removed.

       --foreground
              Specify that the dmfilemapd daemon  should  run  in  the  fore‐
              ground.  The daemon will not fork into the background, and will
              replace the dmstats command that started it.

       --groupid id
              Specify the group to operate on.

       --bounds histogram_boundaries[ns|us|ms|s]
              Specify the boundaries of a latency histogram to be tracked for
              the region as a comma separated list of latency values. Latency
              values are given in nanoseconds. An optional unit suffix of ns,
              us,  ms, or s may be given after each value to specify units of
              nanoseconds, microseconds, miliseconds or seconds respectively.

       --histogram
              When used with the report  and  list  commands  select  default
              fields that emphasize latency histogram data.

       --interval seconds
              Specify  the  interval in seconds between successive iterations
              for repeating reports. If --interval is specified  but  --count
              is not, reports will continue to repeat until interrupted.

       --length length[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T|p|P|e|E]
              Specify  the  length  of a new statistics region in sectors. An
              optional  suffix  selects   units   of:   (b)ytes,   (s)ectors,
              (k)ilobytes,     (m)egabytes,     (g)igabytes,     (t)erabytes,
              (p)etabytes, (e)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples  of  1000
              (S.I.) instead of 1024.

       -j|--major major
              Specify the major number.

       -m|--minor minor
              Specify the minor number.

       --nogroup
              When creating regions mapping the extents of a file in the file
              system, do not create a group or set an alias.

       --nosuffix
              Suppress the suffix on output sizes.  Use with --units  (except
              h and H) if processing the output.

       --notimesuffix
              Suppress  the  suffix on output time values. Histogram boundary
              values will be reported in units of nanoseconds.

       -o|--options
              Specify which report fields to display.

       -O|--sort sort_fields
              Sort output according to the list of fields given. Precede  any
              sort field with '-' for a reverse sort on that column.

       --precise
              Attempt  to use nanosecond precision counters when creating new
              statistics regions.

       --programid id
              Specify a program  ID  string.  When  creating  new  statistics
              regions this string is stored with the region. Subsequent oper‐
              ations may supply a program ID in order to select only  regions
              with  a matching value. The default program ID for dmstats-man‐
              aged regions is "dmstats".

       --region
              When peforming a list or report, include objects of type region
              in the results.

       --regionid id
              Specify the region to operate on.

       --regions region_list
              Specify  a list of regions to group. The group list is a comma-
              separated list of region identifiers. Continuous  sequences  of
              identifiers  may  be expressed as a hyphen separated range, for
              example: '1-10'.

       --relative
              If displaying the histogram report show  relative  (percentage)
              values instead of absolute counts.

       -S|--select selection
              Display  only rows that match selection criteria. All rows with
              the additional "selected" column (-o selected) showing 1 if the
              row matches the selection and 0 otherwise. The selection crite‐
              ria are defined by specifying column names and their valid val‐
              ues while making use of supported comparison operators.

       --start start[b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T|p|P|e|E]
              Specify the start offset of a new statistics region in sectors.
              An  optional  suffix  selects  units  of:  (b)ytes,  (s)ectors,
              (k)ilobytes,     (m)egabytes,     (g)igabytes,     (t)erabytes,
              (p)etabytes, (e)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples  of  1000
              (S.I.) instead of 1024.

       --segments
              When  used with create, create a new statistics region for each
              target contained in the given device(s). This causes a separate
              region to be allocated for each segment of the device.

              The newly created regions are automatically placed into a group
              unless the --nogroup option is given. When grouping is  enabled
              a group alias may be specified using the --alias option.

       --units [units][h|H|b|B|s|S|k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T|p|P|e|E]
              Set  the display units for report output.  All sizes are output
              in   these   units:   (h)uman-readable,   (b)ytes,   (s)ectors,
              (k)ilobytes,     (m)egabytes,     (g)igabytes,     (t)erabytes,
              (p)etabytes, (e)xabytes.  Capitalise to use multiples  of  1000
              (S.I.)  instead  of  1024.   Can also specify custom units e.g.
              --units 3M.

       --userdata user_data
              Specify user data (a word) to be stored with a new region.  The
              value  is  added  to any internal auxilliary data (for example,
              group information), and stored with the region in the  aux_data
              field provided by the kernel. Whitespace is not permitted.

       -u|--uuid
              Specify the uuid.

       -v|--verbose [-v|--verbose]
              Produce additional output.

COMMANDS
       clear device_name [--allprograms|--programid id]
              [--allregions|--regionid id]
              Instructs the kernel to clear statistics counters for the  spe‐
              ficied regions (with the exception of in-flight IO counters).

       create device_name...|file_path...|--alldevices [--areas
              nr_areas|--areasize area_size] [--bounds histogram_boundaries]
              [--filemap] [--follow follow_mode] [--foreground] [--nomonitor]
              [--nogroup] [--precise] [--start start_sector --length
              length|--segments] [--userdata user_data] [--programid id]
              Creates  one  or  more  new statistics regions on the specified
              device(s).

              The region will span  the  entire  device  unless  --start  and
              --length  or  --segments  are  given.  The  --start an --length
              options allow a region of arbitrary length to be placed  at  an
              arbitrary  offset into the device. The --segments option causes
              a new region to be created for each target in the corresponding
              device-mapper device's table.

              If  the  --precise  option  is used the command will attempt to
              create a region using nanosecond precision counters.

              If --bounds is given a latency histogram will  be  tracked  for
              the  new region. The boundaries of the histogram bins are given
              as a comma separated  list  of  latency  values.  There  is  an
              implicit  lower  bound of zero on the first bin and an implicit
              upper bound of infinity (or the configured  interval  duration)
              on the final bin.

              Latencies  are given in nanoseconds. An optional unit suffix of
              ns, us, ms, or s may be given after each value to specify units
              of  nanoseconds,  microseconds,  miliseconds or seconds respec‐
              tively, so for example, 10ms is equivalent to 10000000. Latency
              values with a precision of less than one milisecond can only be
              used when precise timestamps are enabled: if --precise  is  not
              given  and  values less than one milisecond are used it will be
              enabled automatically.

              An optional program_id or user_data string  may  be  associated
              with  the  region.  A  program_id  may  then  be used to select
              regions for subsequent list, print, and report operations.  The
              user_data stores an arbitrary string and is not used by dmstats
              or the device-mapper kernel statistics subsystem.

              By  default  dmstats  creates  regions  with  a  program_id  of
              "dmstats".

              On success the region_id of the newly created region is printed
              to stdout.

              If the --filemap option is given with a regular file,  or  list
              of  files,  as  the  file_path  argument,  instead  of creating
              regions with parameters specified on the command line,  dmstats
              will  open  the  files  located at file_path and create regions
              corresponding to the physical extents allocated  to  the  file.
              This  can be used to monitor statistics for individual files in
              the file system, for  example,  virtual  machine  images,  swap
              areas, or large database files.

              To  work  with the --filemap option, files must be located on a
              local file system, backed by a device-mapper device, that  sup‐
              ports physical extent data using the FIEMAP ioctl (Ext4 and XFS
              for e.g.).

              By default regions that map a file are placed into a group  and
              the group alias is set to the basename of the file. This behav‐
              iour can be overridden with the --alias and --nogroup options.

              Creating a group that maps a file automatically starts  a  dae‐
              mon,  dmfilemapd  to monitor the file and update the mapping as
              the extents allocated to the file change. This behaviour can be
              disabled using the --nomonitor option.

              Use  the  --group option to only display information for groups
              when listing and reporting.

       delete device_name|--alldevices [--allprograms|--programid id]
              [--allregions|--regionid id]
              Delete  the  specified  statistics  region.  All  counters  and
              resources used by the region are released and the  region  will
              not  appear  in the output of subsequent list, print, or report
              operations.

              All regions registered on a device may be removed using  --all‐
              regions.

              To  remove  all  regions  on  all devices both --allregions and
              --alldevices must be used.

              If a --groupid is given instead of  a  --regionid  the  command
              will  attempt  to delete the group and all regions that it con‐
              tains.

              If a deleted region is the first member of a group  of  regions
              the group will also be removed.

       group [device_name|--alldevices] [--alias name] [--regions regions]
              Combine  one or more statistics regions on the specified device
              into a group.

              The list of regions to be grouped is specified  with  --regions
              and  an optional alias may be assigned with --alias. The set of
              regions is given as a comma-separated list  of  region  identi‐
              fiers.  A continuous range of identifers spanning from R1 to R2
              may be expressed as 'R1-R2'.

              Regions that have a histogram configured  can  be  grouped:  in
              this  case  the  number of histogram bins and their bounds must
              match exactly.

              On success the  group  list  and  newly  created  group_id  are
              printed to stdout.

              The  group  metadata is stored with the first (lowest numbered)
              region_id in the group: deleting this region will  also  delete
              the  group  and  other  group members will be returned to their
              prior state.

       help [-c|-C|--columns]
              Outputs a summary of the commands available, optionally includ‐
              ing the list of report fields.

       list [device_name] [--histogram] [--allprograms|--programid id]
              [--units units] [--area] [--region] [--group] [--nosuffix]
              [--notimesuffix] [-v|--verbose]
              List the statistics regions, areas, or groups registered on the
              device.  If the --allprograms switch is given all regions  will
              be listed regardless of region program ID values.

              By default only regions and groups are included in list output.
              If -v or --verbose is given the report will also include a  row
              of information for each configured group and for each area con‐
              tained in each region displayed.

              Regions that contain a single area are by default omitted  from
              the  verbose  list  since their properties are identical to the
              area that they contain - to view all regions regardless of  the
              number  of  areas present use --region). To also view the areas
              contained within regions use --area.

              If --histogram is given the report will include the  bin  count
              and latency boundary values for any configured histograms.

       print [device_name] [--clear] [--allprograms|--programid id]
              [--allregions|--regionid id]
              Print raw statistics counters for the specified region  or  for
              all present regions.

       report [device_name] [--interval seconds] [--count count] [--units
              units] [--histogram] [--allprograms|--programid id]
              [--allregions|--regionid id] [--area] [--region] [--group]
              [-O|--sort sort_fields] [-S|--select selection] [--units units]
              [--nosuffix] [--notimesuffix]
              Start  a  report  for  the  specified object or for all present
              objects. If the count argument is specified,  the  report  will
              repeat  at  a  fixed interval set by the --interval option. The
              default interval is one second.

              If the --allprograms switch  is  given,  all  regions  will  be
              listed, regardless of region program ID values.

              If  the  --histogram  is given the report will include the his‐
              togram values and latency boundaries.

              If the --relative is used the default histogram field  displays
              bin values as a percentage of the total number of I/Os.

              Object  types  (areas,  regions  and  groups) to include in the
              report are selected using the  --area,  --region,  and  --group
              options.

       ungroup [device_name|--alldevices] [--groupid id]
              Remove  an existing group and return all the group's regions to
              their original state.

              The group to be removed is specified using --groupid.

       update_filemap file_path [--groupid id] [--follow follow_mode]
              [--foreground]
              Update  a  group of dmstats regions specified by group_id, that
              were previously created with --filemap, either directly, or  by
              starting the monitoring daemon, dmfilemapd.

              This  will  add  and  remove  regions to reflect changes in the
              allocated extents of the file on-disk, since the time  that  it
              was crated or last updated.

              Use of this command is not normally needed since the dmfilemapd
              daemon will automatically monitor filemap  groups  and  perform
              these updates when required.

              If a filemapped group was created with --nomonitor, or the dae‐
              mon has been killed, the update_filemap can be used to manually
              force an update or start a new daemon.

              Use  --nomonitor  to force a direct update and disable starting
              the monitoring daemon.

REGIONS, AREAS, AND GROUPS
       The device-mapper  statistics  facility  allows  separate  performance
       counters  to  be maintained for arbitrary regions of devices. A region
       may span any range: from a single sector to the whole device. A region
       may  be  further  sub-divided  into a number of distinct areas (one or
       more), each with its own counter set. In this case a summary value for
       the entire region is also available for use in reports.

       In  addition, one or more regions on one device can be combined into a
       statistics group. Groups allow several regions to  be  aggregated  and
       reported  as  a  single entity; counters for all regions and areas are
       summed and used to report totals for all group  members.  Groups  also
       permit  the assignment of an optional alias, allowing meaningful names
       to be associated with sets of regions.

       The  group  metadata  is  stored  with  the  first  (lowest  numbered)
       region_id  in  the  group:  deleting  this region will also delete the
       group and other group members will be returned to their prior state.

       By default new  regions  span  the  entire  device.  The  --start  and
       --length options allows a region of any size to be placed at any loca‐
       tion on the device.

       Using offsets it is possible to create  regions  that  map  individual
       objects  within  a  block  device (for example: partitions, files in a
       file system, or stripes or other structures in a RAID volume).  Groups
       allow  several  non-contiguous  regions  to  be assembled together for
       reporting and data aggregation.

       A region may be either divided into the  specified  number  of  equal-
       sized  areas,  or  into  areas  of the given size by specifying one of
       --areas or --areasize when creating a region with the create  command.
       Depending  on  the  size  of the areas and the device region the final
       area within the region may be smaller than requested.

       Region identifiers

       Each region is assigned an identifier when it is created that is  used
       to  reference  the region in subsequent operations. Region identifiers
       are unique within a given  device  (including  across  different  pro‐
       gram_id values).

       Depending  on  the  sequence of create and delete operations, gaps may
       exist in the sequence of region_id values for a particular device.

       The region_id should be treated as an opaque identifier used to refer‐
       ence the region.

       Group identifiers

       Groups  are also assigned an integer identifier at creation time; like
       region identifiers, group identifiers are unique within the containing
       device.

       The  group_id should be treated as an opaque identifier used to refer‐
       ence the group.

FILE MAPPING
       Using --filemap, it is possible to create regions that  correspond  to
       the extents of a file in the file system. This allows IO statistics to
       be monitored on a per-file basis, for example to observe  large  data‐
       base files, virtual machine images, or other files of interest.

       To  be  able to use file mapping, the file must be backed by a device-
       mapper device, and in a file system that  supports  the  FIEMAP  ioctl
       (and  which returns data describing the physical location of extents).
       This currently includes xfs(5) and ext4(5).

       By default the regions making up a  file  are  placed  together  in  a
       group, and the group alias is set to the basename(3) of the file. This
       allows statistics to be reported for the file as a whole,  aggregating
       values for the regions making up the group. To see only the whole file
       (group) when using the list and report commands, use --group.

       Since it is possible for the file to change after the initial group of
       regions  is created, the update_filemap command, and dmfilemapd daemon
       are provided to update file mapped groups either manually or automati‐
       cally.

       File follow modes

       The file map monitoring daemon can monitor files in two distinct ways:
       follow-inode mode, and follow-path mode.

       The mode affects the behaviour of the daemon when a file  under  moni‐
       toring is renamed or unlinked, and the conditions which cause the dae‐
       mon to terminate.

       If follow-inode mode is used, the daemon will hold the file open,  and
       continue  to  update regions from the same file descriptor. This means
       that the mapping will follow rename, move (within the same  file  sys‐
       tem),  and  unlink  operations.  This  mode  is  useful if the file is
       expected to be moved, renamed, or unlinked while  it  is  being  moni‐
       tored.

       In  follow-inode  mode,  the daemon will exit once it detects that the
       file has been unlinked and it is the last holder of a reference to it.

       If follow-path is used, the daemon will re-open the provided  path  on
       each  monitoring  iteration. This means that the group will be updated
       to reflect a new file being moved to the same  path  as  the  original
       file.  This  mode  is useful for files that are expected to be updated
       via unlink and rename.

       In follow-path mode, the daemon will exit if the file is  removed  and
       not replaced within a brief tolerance interval (one second).

       To  stop  the  daemon, delete the group containing the mapped regions:
       the daemon will automatically shut down.

       The daemon can also be safely killed at any time and the  group  kept:
       if  the file is still being allocated the mapping will become progres‐
       sively out-of-date as extents are added and removed (in this case  the
       daemon  can  be  re-started  or  the  group  updated manually with the
       update_filemap command).

       See the  create  command  and  --filemap,  --follow,  and  --nomonitor
       options for further information.

       Limitations

       The  daemon attempts to maintain good synchronisation between the file
       extents and the regions contained in the group, however, since it  can
       only  react  to new allocations once they have been written, there are
       inevitably some IO events that cannot be counted when a file is  grow‐
       ing,  particularly  if  the  file is being extended by a single thread
       writing beyond end-of-file (for example, the dd program).

       There is a further loss of events in that there is currently no way to
       atomically  resize  a  dmstats region and preserve its current counter
       values. This affects files when  they  grow  by  extending  the  final
       extent, rather than allocating a new extent: any events that had accu‐
       mulated in the region between any prior operation and the  resize  are
       lost.

       File  mapping  is currently most effective in cases where the majority
       of IO does not trigger extent allocation. Future updates  may  address
       these limitations when kernel support is available.

REPORT FIELDS
       The  dmstats  report provides several types of field that may be added
       to the default field set, or used to create custom reports.

       All performance counters and metrics are calculated per-area.

   Derived metrics
       A number of metrics fields are included that provide high  level  per‐
       formance  indicators.  These  are  based on the fields provided by the
       conventional Linux iostat program  and  are  derived  from  the  basic
       counter values provided by the kernel for each area.

       reads_merged_per_sec
              Reads merged per second.

       writes_merged_per_sec
              Writes merged per second.

       reads_per_sec
              Reads completed per second.

       writes_per_sec
              Writes completed per second.

       read_size_per_sec
              Size of data read per second.

       write_size_per_sec
              Size of data written per second.

       avg_request_size
              Average request size.

       queue_size
              Average queue size.

       await  The average wait time for read and write operations.

       r_await
              The average wait time for read operations.

       w_await
              The average wait time for write operations.

       throughput
              The device throughput in operations per second.

       service_time
              The  average  service  time  (in  milliseconds)  for operations
              issued to the device.

       util   Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to
              the device (bandwidth utilization for the device). Device satu‐
              ration occurs when this value is close to 100%.

   Group, region and area meta fields
       Meta fields provide information about the groups,  regions,  or  areas
       that  the  statistics  values  relate to. This includes the region and
       area identifier, start, length, and counts, as well as the program  ID
       and user data values.

       region_id
              Region  identifier.  This is a non-negative integer returned by
              the kernel when a statistics region is created.

       region_start
              The region start location. Display units are  selected  by  the
              --units option.

       region_len
              The  length  of  the  region. Display units are selected by the
              --units option.

       area_id
              Area identifier. Area identifiers are assigned by  the  device-
              mapper  statistics  library  and  uniquely  identify  each area
              within a region. Each ID corresponds to a distinct set of  per‐
              formance  counters for that area of the statistics region. Area
              identifiers are always monotonically increasing within a region
              so that higher ID values correspond to greater sector addresses
              within the area and no gaps  in  the  sequence  of  identifiers
              exist.

       area_start
              The  area  start  location.  Display  units are selected by the
              --units option.

       area_len
              The length of the area.  Display  units  are  selected  by  the
              --units option.

       area_count
              The number of areas in this region.

       program_id
              The program ID value associated with this region.

       user_data
              The user data value associated with this region.

       group_id
              Group  identifier.  This  is a non-negative integer returned by
              the dmstats group command when a statistics group is created.

       interval_ns
              The estimated interval over which the  current  counter  values
              have   accumulated.  The  value  is  reported  as  an  interger
              expressed in units of nanoseconds.

       interval
              The estimated interval over which the  current  counter  values
              have  accumulated.  The  value  is reported as a real number in
              units of seconds.

   Basic counters
       Basic counters provide access to the raw counter data from the kernel,
       allowing further processing to be carried out by another program.

       The  kernel  provides  thirteen  separate counters for each statistics
       area. The first  eleven  of  these  match  the  counters  provided  in
       /proc/diskstats  or  /sys/block/*/*/stat. The final pair provide sepa‐
       rate counters for read and write time.

       read_count
              Count of reads completed this interval.

       reads_merged_count
              Count of reads merged this interval.

       read_sector_count
              Count of 512 byte sectors read this interval.

       read_time
              Accumulated duration of all read requests (ns).

       write_count
              Count of writes completed this interval.

       writes_merged_count
              Count of writes merged this interval.

       write_sector_count
              Count of 512 byte sectors written this interval.

       write_time
              Accumulated duration of all write requests (ns).

       in_progress_count
              Count of requests currently in progress.

       io_ticks
              Nanoseconds spent servicing requests.

       queue_ticks
              This field is incremented at each I/O  start,  I/O  completion,
              I/O  merge,  or  read  of  these stats by the number of I/Os in
              progress multiplied by the number of milliseconds  spent  doing
              I/O  since  the last update of this field.  This can provide an
              easy measure of both I/O completion time and the  backlog  that
              may be accumulating.

       read_ticks
              Nanoseconds spent servicing reads.

       write_ticks
              Nanoseconds spent servicing writes.

   Histogram fields
       Histograms  measure  the  frequency distribution of user specified I/O
       latency intervals. Histogram  bin  boundaries  are  specified  when  a
       region is created.

       A  brief  representation of the histogram values and latency intervals
       can be included in the report using these fields.

       hist_count
              A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics  area
              in  order of ascending latency value. Each value represents the
              number of I/Os with latency times falling into that bin's  time
              range during the sample period.

       hist_count_bounds
              A  list of the histogram counts for the current statistics area
              in order of ascending latency value including  bin  boundaries:
              each  count is prefixed by the lower bound of the corresponding
              histogram bin.

       hist_count_ranges
              A list of the histogram counts for the current statistics  area
              in  order  of ascending latency value including bin boundaries:
              each count is prefixed by both the lower and  upper  bounds  of
              the corresponding histogram bin.

       hist_percent
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current statis‐
              tics area in order of ascending latency value, expressed  as  a
              percentage.  Each  value represents the proportion of I/Os with
              latency times falling into that bin's  time  range  during  the
              sample period.

       hist_percent_bounds
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current statis‐
              tics area in order of ascending latency value, expressed  as  a
              percentage  and including bin boundaries. Each value represents
              the proportion of I/Os with latency  times  falling  into  that
              bin's  time range during the sample period and is prefixed with
              the corresponding bin's lower bound.

       hist_percent_ranges
              A list of the relative histogram values for the current statis‐
              tics  area  in order of ascending latency value, expressed as a
              percentage and including bin boundaries. Each value  represents
              the  proportion  of  I/Os  with latency times falling into that
              bin's time range during the sample period and is prefixed  with
              the corresponding bin's lower and upper bounds.

       hist_bounds
              A list of the histogram boundary values for the current statis‐
              tics area in order of ascending latency value.  The values  are
              expressed  in whole units of seconds, miliseconds, microseconds
              or nanoseconds with a suffix indicating the unit.

       hist_ranges
              A list of the histogram bin ranges for the  current  statistics
              area  in  order  of  ascending  latency  value.  The values are
              expressed as "LOWER-UPPER" in whole units of seconds,  milisec‐
              onds,  microseconds or nanoseconds with a suffix indicating the
              unit.

       hist_bins
              The number of latency histogram bins configured for the area.
