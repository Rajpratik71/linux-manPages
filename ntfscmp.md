NTFSCMP(8)                 System Manager's Manual                 NTFSCMP(8)

NAME
       ntfscmp - compare two NTFS filesystems and tell the differences

SYNOPSIS
       ntfscmp [OPTIONS] DEVICE1 DEVICE2

DESCRIPTION
       The  ntfscmp  program  makes a comparison between two NTFS filesystems
       from all aspects and reports all variances it finds.  The  filesystems
       can  be on block devices or images files. Ntfscmp can be used for vol‐
       ume verification however its primary purpose was to  be  an  efficient
       development  tool, used to quickly locate, identify and check the cor‐
       rectness of the metadata changes made to NTFS.

       If one is interested only in the NTFS metadata changes then  it  could
       be  useful to compare the metadata images created by using the --meta‐
       data option of ntfsclone(8) to  eliminate  the  usually  uninteresting
       timestamp changes.

       The terse output of ntfscmp is intentional because the provided infor‐
       mation is enough in each case to determine the exact differences. This
       can  be achieved, for instance, if one compares the verbose outputs of
       ntfsinfo(8) for each reported inodes by the diff(1) utility.
