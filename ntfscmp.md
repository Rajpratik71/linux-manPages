NTFSCMP(8)                              System Manager's Manual                             NTFSCMP(8)

NAME
       ntfscmp - compare two NTFS filesystems and tell the differences

SYNOPSIS
       ntfscmp [OPTIONS] DEVICE1 DEVICE2

DESCRIPTION
       The  ntfscmp  program  makes a comparison between two NTFS filesystems from all aspects and re‐
       ports all variances it finds.  The filesystems can be on block devices or images files. Ntfscmp
       can be used for volume verification however its primary purpose was to be an efficient develop‐
       ment tool, used to quickly locate, identify and check the correctness of the  metadata  changes
       made to NTFS.

       If  one  is interested only in the NTFS metadata changes then it could be useful to compare the
       metadata images created by using the --metadata option of ntfsclone(8) to eliminate the usually
       uninteresting timestamp changes.

       The  terse  output of ntfscmp is intentional because the provided information is enough in each
       case to determine the exact differences. This can be achieved, for instance,  if  one  compares
       the verbose outputs of ntfsinfo(8) for each reported inodes by the diff(1) utility.
