PO2DEBCONF(1)                                 po-debconf                                 PO2DEBCONF(1)

NAME
       po2debconf - merge master templates file and PO files

SYNOPSIS
       po2debconf [-v] [-h] [--podir=DIR] [-o FILE] [-e STRING] master

DESCRIPTION
       This program reads all PO files and a single templates file, and produces a Debconf templates
       file containing all translations, similar to the one produced by debconf-mergetemplate(1) (from
       the "debconf-utils" package).  PO files are by default searched in the po subdirectory below
       the location of the master file.

       To help the language code transition for Norwegian BokmÃ¥l, the no and nb language codes are
       handled specially.  If no.po exists, it should be renamed to nb.po.  Using nb.po will make both
       "-no" and "-nb" translations available in the templates file.

       Lines beginning with a number sign ("#") are comments in templates files.  They are useful to
       give hints to translators, and are discarded by po2debconf.  Special comments have been
       introduced in "po-debconf" 1.0.  They are in the form "#flag:directive".  The "#flag:partial"
       is the only directive interpreted by po2debconf.  Normally when a field is composed of several
       paragraphs (like "__Choices" and "_Description"), it is translated if all paragraphs are
       translated.  When a field contains "#flag:partial", translated strings may be mixed with
       untranslated strings.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display a usage summary and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           Process in verbose mode.

       --podir=DIR
           Set directory for PO files.  Default is to search PO files in the po subdirectory below the
           location of the master file.

       -o, --output=FILE
           Set output filename (default is standard output).

       -e, --encoding=STRING
           Convert encoding.  Argument can take 3 values: "utf8" (convert to UTF-8), "po" (do not
           change encoding) and "popular" (convert encoding of input files depending on their
           language; the "PODEBCONF_ENCODINGS" environment variable must point to a name of a file
           containing the encoding map).

           Such a filename looks like:

             #
             #   Number is comment sign
             #
             cs       ISO-8859-2
             da       ISO-8859-1
             de       ISO-8859-1
             el       ISO-8859-7

           etc.

           Default encoding used to be "popular", and has been switched to "utf8" since po-debconf
           0.9.0.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       Since debconf 1.2.0, templates format has changed, encoding is part of field names, i.e. they
       are "foo-lang.encoding".  When older debconf encounter such fields, they are silently ignored,
       which means that original text is displayed.

       If present, a po/output file can override defaults for encoding and output format.  It contains
       a single line with two fields. The first field is the output format (currently valid values are
       1 for fields in the form "foo-lang", and 2 for "foo-lang.encoding") and the second field is the
       encoding, e.g.

          echo '2 utf8' > po/output

       let po2debconf convert text to UTF-8.

       When encoding is set to "po" or "utf8", output format is always set to 2, so that older debconf
       do not try to display text with wrong encodings.
