NAME
       parkill - Kill all processes running a specified command

SYNOPSIS
       parkill [ -debug ] [ -verbose ] [ -user=name ] program

DESCRIPTION
       parkill kills all processes running a specified command.

       Many systems also have the "killall" command; this should be used instead if it is available.

       This script relies on the ps command; where possible, it uses the /proc/<pid>/cmdline interface to more reliably access the commandline (to
       avoid matching command line parameters as if they were functions).

OPTIONS
       -debug Print debug information.

       -verbose
              Be verbose.

       --user=name
              Only kill processes belonging to a particular user. Root privileges are required for this option.
