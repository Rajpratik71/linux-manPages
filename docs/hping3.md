DESCRIPTION
       hping3 is a network tool able to send custom TCP/IP packets and to display target replies like ping program does with ICMP replies.  hping3
       handle  fragmentation,  arbitrary  packets body and size and can be used in order to transfer files encapsulated under supported protocols.
       Using hping3 you are able to perform at least the following stuff:

        - Test firewall rules
        - Advanced port scanning
        - Test net performance using different protocols,
          packet size, TOS (type of service) and fragmentation.
        - Path MTU discovery
        - Transferring files between even really fascist firewall
          rules.
        - Traceroute-like under different protocols.
        - Firewalk-like usage.
        - Remote OS fingerprinting.
        - TCP/IP stack auditing.
        - A lot of others.

       It's also a good didactic tool to learn TCP/IP.  hping3 is developed and maintained by antirez@invece.org and is licensed under GPL version
       2. Development is open so you can send me patches, suggestion and affronts without inhibitions.

HPING SITE
       primary  site  at  http://www.hping.org.   You  can found both the stable release and the instruction to download the latest source code at
       http://www.hping.org/download.html

BASE OPTIONS
       -h --help
              Show an help screen on standard output, so you can pipe to less.

       -v --version
              Show version information and API used to access to data link layer, linux sock packet or libpcap.

       -c --count count
              Stop after sending (and receiving) count response packets. After last packet was send hping3 wait COUNTREACHED_TIMEOUT seconds  tar‐
              get host replies. You are able to tune COUNTREACHED_TIMEOUT editing hping2.h

       -i --interval
              Wait  the  specified number of seconds or micro seconds between sending each packet.  --interval X set wait to X seconds, --interval
              uX set wait to X micro seconds.  The default is to wait one second between each packet. Using hping3 to  transfer  files  tune  this
              option  is  really important in order to increase transfer rate. Even using hping3 to perform idle/spoofing scanning you should tune
              this option, see HPING3-HOWTO for more information.

       --fast Alias for -i u10000. Hping will send 10 packets for second.

       --faster
              Alias for -i u1. Faster then --fast ;) (but not as fast as your computer can send packets due to the signal-driven design).

       --flood
              Sent packets as fast as possible, without taking care to show incoming replies.  This is ways faster  than  to  specify  the  -i  u0
              option.

       -n --numeric
              Numeric output only, No attempt will be made to lookup symbolic names for host addresses.

       -q --quiet
              Quiet output. Nothing is displayed except the summary lines at startup time and when finished.

       -I --interface interface name
              By  default  on  linux  and  BSD  systems hping3 uses default routing interface.  In other systems or when there is no default route
              hping3 uses the first non-loopback interface.  However you are able to force hping3 to use the interface you need using this option.
              Note:  you don't need to specify the whole name, for example -I et will match eth0 ethernet0 myet1 et cetera. If no interfaces match
              hping3 will try to use lo.

       -V --verbose
              Enable verbose output. TCP replies will be shown as follows:

              len=46 ip=192.168.1.1 flags=RA DF seq=0 ttl=255 id=0 win=0 rtt=0.4 ms tos=0 iplen=40 seq=0 ack=1380893504 sum=2010 urp=0

       -D --debug
              Enable debug mode, it's useful when you experience some problem with hping3. When debug mode is enabled you will get  more  informa‐
              tion  about interface detection, data link layer access, interface settings, options parsing, fragmentation, HCMP protocol and other
              stuff.

       -z --bind
              Bind CTRL+Z to time to live (TTL) so you will able to increment/decrement ttl of outgoing packets pressing CTRL+Z once or twice.

       -Z --unbind
              Unbind CTRL+Z so you will able to stop hping3.

       --beep Beep for every matching received packet (but not for ICMP errors).

PROTOCOL SELECTION
       Default protocol is TCP, by default hping3 will send tcp headers to target host's port 0 with a winsize of 64  without  any  tcp  flag  on.
       Often this is the best way to do an 'hide ping', useful when target is behind a firewall that drop ICMP. Moreover a tcp null-flag to port 0
       has a good probability of not being logged.

       -0 --rawip
              RAW IP mode, in this mode hping3 will send IP header with data appended with --signature and/or  --file,  see  also  --ipproto  that
              allows you to set the ip protocol field.

       -1 --icmp
              ICMP mode, by default hping3 will send ICMP echo-request, you can set other ICMP type/code using --icmptype --icmpcode options.

       -2 --udp
              UDP  mode,  by  default  hping3  will  send  udp to target host's port 0.  UDP header tunable options are the following: --baseport,
              --destport, --keep.

       -8 --scan
              Scan mode, the option expects an argument that describes groups of ports  to  scan.  port  groups  are  comma  separated:  a  number
              describes  just  a  single  port, so 1,2,3 means port 1, 2 and 3. ranges are specified using a start-end notation, like 1-1000, that
              tell hping to scan ports between 1 and 1000 (included). the special word all is an alias for 0-65535, while the special  word  known
              includes all the ports listed in /etc/services.
              Groups can be combined, so the following command line will scan ports between 1 and 1000 AND port 8888 AND ports listed in /etc/ser‐
              vices: hping --scan 1-1000,8888,known -S target.host.com
              Groups can be negated (subtracted) using a ! character as prefix, so the following command line will scan all the ports  NOT  listed
              in /etc/services in the range 1-1024: hping --scan '1-1024,!known' -S target.host.com
              Keep in mind that while hping seems much more like a port scanner in this mode, most of the hping switches are still honored, so for
              example to perform a SYN scan you need to specify the -S option, you can change the TCP windows size, TTL, control the IP fragmenta‐
              tion  as  usually,  and  so on. The only real difference is that the standard hping behaviors are encapsulated into a scanning algo‐
              rithm.
              Tech note: The scan mode uses a two-processes design, with shared memory for synchronization. The scanning algorithm  is  still  not
              optimal, but already quite fast.
              Hint: unlike most scanners, hping shows some interesting info about received packets, the IP ID, TCP win, TTL, and so on, don't for‐
              get to look at this additional information when you perform a scan! Sometimes they shows interesting details.

       -9 --listen signature
              HPING3 listen mode, using this option hping3 waits for packet that contain signature and dump from signature end  to  packet's  end.
              For example if hping3 --listen TEST reads a packet that contain 234-09sdflkjs45-TESThello_world it will display hello_world.

IP RELATED OPTIONS
       -a --spoof hostname
              Use  this  option in order to set a fake IP source address, this option ensures that target will not gain your real address. However
              replies will be sent to spoofed address, so you will can't see them. In order to see how it's possible to perform spoofed/idle scan‐
              ning see the HPING3-HOWTO.

       --rand-source
              This  option  enables  the  random  source  mode.  hping will send packets with random source address. It is interesting to use this
              option to stress firewall state tables, and other per-ip basis dynamic tables inside the TCP/IP stacks and firewall software.

       --rand-dest
              This option enables the random destination mode.  hping will send the packets to random addresses obtained following  the  rule  you
              specify  as the target host. You need to specify a numerical IP address as target host like 10.0.0.x.  All the occurrences of x will
              be replaced with a random number in the range 0-255. So to obtain Internet IP addresses in the whole IPv4 space use  something  like
              hping  x.x.x.x  --rand-dest.  If you are not sure about what kind of addresses your rule is generating try to use the --debug switch
              to display every new destination address generated.  When this option is turned on, matching packets will be  accept  from  all  the
              destinations.
              Warning: when this option is enabled hping can't detect the right outgoing interface for the packets, so you should use the --inter‐
              face option to select the desired outgoing interface.

       -t --ttl time to live
              Using this option you can set TTL (time to live) of outgoing packets, it's likely that you will use this with --traceroute or --bind
              options. If in doubt try `hping3 some.host.com -t 1 --traceroute'.

       -N --id
              Set  ip->id  field.  Default  id is random but if fragmentation is turned on and id isn't specified it will be getpid() & 0xFFFF, to
              implement a better solution is in TODO list.

       -H --ipproto
              Set the ip protocol in RAW IP mode.

       -W --winid
              id from Windows* systems before Win2k has different byte ordering, if this option is enable hping3 will properly display id  replies
              from those Windows.

       -r --rel
              Display  id  increments  instead  of  id. See the HPING3-HOWTO for more information. Increments aren't computed as id[N]-id[N-1] but
              using packet loss compensation. See relid.c for more information.

       -f --frag
              Split packets in more fragments, this may be useful in order to test IP stacks fragmentation performance and to test if some  packet
              filter is so weak that can be passed using tiny fragments (anachronistic). Default 'virtual mtu' is 16 bytes. see also --mtu option.

       -x --morefrag
              Set more fragments IP flag, use this option if you want that target host send an ICMP time-exceeded during reassembly.

       -y --dontfrag
              Set don't fragment IP flag, this can be used to perform MTU path discovery.

       -g --fragoff fragment offset value
              Set the fragment offset.

       -m --mtu mtu value
              Set  different  'virtual  mtu' than 16 when fragmentation is enabled. If packets size is greater that 'virtual mtu' fragmentation is
              automatically turned on.

       -o --tos hex_tos
              Set Type Of Service (TOS), for more information try --tos help.

       -G --rroute
              Record route. Includes the RECORD_ROUTE option in each packet sent and displays the route buffer of returned packets. Note that  the
              IP  header  is  only large enough for nine such routes. Many hosts ignore or discard this option. Also note that using hping you are
              able to use record route even if target host filter ICMP. Record route is an IP option, not an ICMP option, so you  can  use  record
              route option even in TCP and UDP mode.

ICMP RELATED OPTIONS
       -C --icmptype type
              Set icmp type, default is ICMP echo request (implies --icmp).

       -K --icmpcode code
              Set icmp code, default is 0 (implies --icmp).

       --icmp-ipver
              Set IP version of IP header contained into ICMP data, default is 4.

       --icmp-iphlen
              Set IP header length of IP header contained into ICMP data, default is 5 (5 words of 32 bits).

       --icmp-iplen
              Set IP packet length of IP header contained into ICMP data, default is the real length.

       --icmp-ipid
              Set IP id of IP header contained into ICMP data, default is random.

       --icmp-ipproto
              Set IP protocol of IP header contained into ICMP data, default is TCP.

       --icmp-cksum
              Set ICMP checksum, for default is the valid checksum.

       --icmp-ts
              Alias for --icmptype 13 (to send ICMP timestamp requests).

       --icmp-addr
              Alias for --icmptype 17 (to send ICMP address mask requests).

TCP/UDP RELATED OPTIONS
       -s --baseport source port
              hping3  uses source port in order to guess replies sequence number. It starts with a base source port number, and increase this num‐
              ber for each packet sent. When packet is received sequence number can be computed as replies.dest.port - base.source.port.   Default
              base  source  port  is random, using this option you are able to set different number. If you need that source port not be increased
              for each sent packet use the -k --keep option.

       -p --destport [+][+]dest port
              Set destination port, default is 0. If '+' character precedes dest port number (i.e. +1024) destination port will be  increased  for
              each reply received. If double '+' precedes dest port number (i.e. ++1024), destination port will be increased for each packet sent.
              By default destination port can be modified interactively using CTRL+z.

       --keep keep still source port, see --baseport for more information.

       -w --win
              Set TCP window size. Default is 64.

       -O --tcpoff
              Set fake tcp data offset. Normal data offset is tcphdrlen / 4.

       -M --tcpseq
              Set the TCP sequence number.

       -L --tcpack
              Set the TCP ack.

       -Q --seqnum
              This option can be used in order to collect sequence numbers generated by target host. This can be useful when you need  to  analyze
              whether TCP sequence number is predictable. Output example:

              #hping3 win98 --seqnum -p 139 -S -i u1 -I eth0
              HPING uaz (eth0 192.168.4.41): S set, 40 headers + 0 data bytes
              2361294848 +2361294848
              2411626496 +50331648
              2545844224 +134217728
              2713616384 +167772160
              2881388544 +167772160
              3049160704 +167772160
              3216932864 +167772160
              3384705024 +167772160
              3552477184 +167772160
              3720249344 +167772160
              3888021504 +167772160
              4055793664 +167772160
              4223565824 +167772160

              The  first column reports the sequence number, the second difference between current and last sequence number. As you can see target
              host's sequence numbers are predictable.

       -b --badcksum
              Send packets with a bad UDP/TCP checksum.

       --tcp-mss
              Enable the TCP MSS option and set it to the given value.

       --tcp-timestamp
              Enable the TCP timestamp option, and try to guess the timestamp update frequency and the remote system uptime.

       -F --fin
              Set FIN tcp flag.

       -S --syn
              Set SYN tcp flag.

       -R --rst
              Set RST tcp flag.

       -P --push
              Set PUSH tcp flag.

       -A --ack
              Set ACK tcp flag.

       -U --urg
              Set URG tcp flag.

       -X --xmas
              Set Xmas tcp flag.

       -Y --ymas
              Set Ymas tcp flag.

COMMON OPTIONS
       -d --data data size
              Set packet body size. Warning, using --data 40 hping3 will not generate 0 byte packets but  protocol_header+40  bytes.  hping3  will
              display  packet  size  information  as  first line output, like this: HPING www.yahoo.com (ppp0 204.71.200.67): NO FLAGS are set, 40
              headers + 40 data bytes

       -E --file filename
              Use filename contents to fill packet's data.

       -e --sign signature
              Fill first signature length bytes of data with signature.  If the signature length is bigger than data size an error message will be
              displayed.   If you don't specify the data size hping will use the signature size as data size.  This option can be used safely with
              --file filename option, remainder data space will be filled using filename.

       -j --dump
              Dump received packets in hex.

       -J --print
              Dump received packets' printable characters.

       -B --safe
              Enable safe protocol, using this option lost packets in file transfers will be resent. For example in order to send file /etc/passwd
              from host A to host B you may use the following:
              [host_a]
              # hping3 host_b --udp -p 53 -d 100 --sign signature --safe --file /etc/passwd
              [host_b]
              # hping3 host_a --listen signature --safe --icmp

       -u --end
              If  you  are  using --file filename option, tell you when EOF has been reached. Moreover prevent that other end accept more packets.
              Please, for more information see the HPING3-HOWTO.

       -T --traceroute
              Traceroute mode. Using this option hping3 will increase ttl for each ICMP time to live 0 during transit received.  Try  hping3  host
              --traceroute.   This  option implies --bind and --ttl 1. You can override the ttl of 1 using the --ttl option. Since 2.0.0 stable it
              prints RTT information.

       --tr-keep-ttl
              Keep the TTL fixed in traceroute mode, so you can monitor just one hop in the route. For example, to monitor how the 5th hop changes
              or how its RTT changes you can try hping3 host --traceroute --ttl 5 --tr-keep-ttl.

       --tr-stop
              If this option is specified hping will exit once the first packet that isn't an ICMP time exceeded is received. This better emulates
              the traceroute behavior.

       --tr-no-rtt
              Don't show RTT information in traceroute mode. The ICMP time exceeded RTT information aren't even calculated if this option is set.

       --tcpexitcode
              Exit with last received packet tcp->th_flag as exit code. Useful for scripts that need, for example, to known if  the  port  999  of
              some host reply with SYN/ACK or with RST in response to SYN, i.e. the service is up or down.

TCP OUTPUT FORMAT
       The standard TCP output format is the following:

       len=46 ip=192.168.1.1 flags=RA DF seq=0 ttl=255 id=0 win=0 rtt=0.4 ms

       len  is  the  size,  in bytes, of the data captured from the data link layer excluding the data link header size. This may not match the IP
       datagram size due to low level transport layer padding.

       ip is the source ip address.

       flags are the TCP flags, R for RESET, S for SYN, A for ACK, F for FIN, P for PUSH, U for URGENT, X for not standard 0x40, Y for  not  stan‐
       dard 0x80.

       If the reply contains DF the IP header has the don't fragment bit set.

       seq is the sequence number of the packet, obtained using the source port for TCP/UDP packets, the sequence field for ICMP packets.

       id is the IP ID field.

       win is the TCP window size.

       rtt is the round trip time in milliseconds.

       If you run hping using the -V command line switch it will display additional information about the packet, example:

       len=46 ip=192.168.1.1 flags=RA DF seq=0 ttl=255 id=0 win=0 rtt=0.4 ms tos=0 iplen=40 seq=0 ack=1223672061 sum=e61d urp=0

       tos is the type of service field of the IP header.

       iplen is the IP total len field.

       seq and ack are the sequence and acknowledge 32bit numbers in the TCP header.

       sum is the TCP header checksum value.

       urp is the TCP urgent pointer value.

UDP OUTPUT FORMAT
       The standard output format is:

       len=46 ip=192.168.1.1 seq=0 ttl=64 id=0 rtt=6.0 ms

       The field meaning is just the same as the TCP output meaning of the same fields.

ICMP OUTPUT FORMAT
       An example of ICMP output is:

       ICMP Port Unreachable from ip=192.168.1.1 name=nano.marmoc.net

       It  is  very  simple to understand. It starts with the string "ICMP" followed by the description of the ICMP error, Port Unreachable in the
       example. The ip field is the IP source address of the IP datagram containing the ICMP error, the name field is just the  numerical  address
       resolved to a name (a dns PTR request) or UNKNOWN if the resolution failed.

       The ICMP Time exceeded during transit or reassembly format is a bit different:

       TTL 0 during transit from ip=192.168.1.1 name=nano.marmoc.net

       TTL 0 during reassembly from ip=192.70.106.25 name=UNKNOWN

       The only difference is the description of the error, it starts with TTL 0.

BUGS
       Even using the --end and --safe options to transfer files the final packet will be padded with 0x00 bytes.

       Data  is  read  without care about alignment, but alignment is enforced in the data structures.  This will not be a problem under i386 but,
       while usually the TCP/IP headers are naturally aligned, may create problems with different processors and bogus packets if  there  is  some
       unaligned access around the code (hopefully none).

       On  solaris  hping does not work on the loopback interface. This seems a solaris problem, as stated in the tcpdump-workers mailing list, so
       the libpcap can't do nothing to handle it properly.
