NAME
       zvbi-chains - VBI proxy wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       zvbi-chains [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       zvbi-chains is a small wrapper which executes the VBI application given on the command line while overloading several C library calls (such
       as open(2) and read(2)) so that the application can be forced to access VBI devices via the VBI proxy instead of device files directly.

       LD_PRELOAD is used to intercept C library calls and call functions in the libzvbi-chain shared library instead.  Parameters  given  on  the
       command line (e.g. device path) are passed to the library by means of environment variables.

OPTIONS
       -dev path
              Path of a VBI device from which to read data.

       -debug level
              Enables debug output: 0 = off (default); 1 = warnings, 2 = all messages.

       -help  Print a short description of all command line options.
