NAME
       lxc-create - creates a container

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-create {-n name} [-f config_file] {-t template} [-B backingstore] [-- template-options]

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-create creates a system object where is stored the configuration information and where can
       be stored user information. The identifier name is used to specify the container  to  be  used
       with the different lxc commands.

       The object is a directory created in /var/lib/lxc and identified by its name.

       The object is the definition of the different resources an application can use or can see. The
       more the configuration file contains information, the more the container is isolated  and  the
       more the application is jailed.

       If the configuration file config_file is not specified, the container will be created with the
       default isolation: processes, sysv ipc and mount points.

OPTIONS
       -f, --config config_file
              Specify the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation  function‐
              alities for the container.

       -t, --template template
              'template'  is  the  short  name of an existing 'lxc-template' script that is called by
              lxc-create, eg. busybox, debian, fedora, ubuntu or sshd.   Refer  to  the  examples  in
              /usr/share/lxc/templates  for details of the expected script structure.  Alternatively,
              the full path to an executable template script can  also  be  passed  as  a  parameter.
              "none" can be used to force lxc-create to skip rootfs creation.

       -B, --bdev backingstore
              'backingstore'  is  one  of 'dir', 'lvm', 'loop', 'btrfs', 'zfs', 'rbd', or 'best'. The
              default is 'dir', meaning that the container root filesystem will be a directory  under
              /var/lib/lxc/container/rootfs.   This  backing  store  type  allows  the optional --dir
              ROOTFS to be specified, meaning that the container rootfs should be  placed  under  the
              specified  path, rather than the default. (The 'none' backingstore type is an alias for
              'dir'.) If 'btrfs' is specified, then the target filesystem must be btrfs, and the con‐
              tainer  rootfs will be created as a new subvolume. This allows snapshotted clones to be
              created, but also causes rsync --one-filesystem to treat it as a  separate  filesystem.
              If  backingstore is 'lvm', then an lvm block device will be used and the following fur‐
              ther options are available: --lvname lvname1 will create an  LV  named  lvname1  rather
              than  the  default, which is the container name. --vgname vgname1 will create the LV in
              volume group vgname1 rather than the default, lxc.  --thinpool  thinpool1  will  create
              the  LV  as  a  thin-provisioned volume in the pool named thinpool1 rather than the de‐
              fault, lxc.  --fstype FSTYPE will create an FSTYPE filesystem on the  LV,  rather  than
              the  default,  which  is ext4.  --fssize SIZE will create a LV (and filesystem) of size
              SIZE rather than the default, which is 1G.

              If backingstore is 'loop', you can use --fstype FSTYPE and --fssize SIZE as 'lvm'.  The
              default values for these options are the same as 'lvm'.

              If backingstore is 'rbd', then you will need to have a valid configuration in ceph.conf
              and a ceph.client.admin.keyring defined.  You  can  specify  the  following  options  :
              --rbdname  RBDNAME  will  create  a  blockdevice named RBDNAME rather than the default,
              which is the container name.  --rbdpool POOL will create the blockdevice  in  the  pool
              named POOL, rather than the default, which is 'lxc'.

              If  backingstore is 'best', then lxc will try, in order, btrfs, zfs, lvm, and finally a
              directory backing store.

       -- template-options
              This will pass template-options to the template as arguments. To see the  list  of  op‐
              tions supported by the template, you can run lxc-create -t TEMPLATE -h.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to most of lxc commands.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       --usage
              Give the usage message

       -q, --quiet
              mute on

       -P, --lxcpath=PATH
              Use an alternate container path. The default is /var/lib/lxc.

       -o, --logfile=FILE
              Output to an alternate log FILE. The default is no log.

       -l, --logpriority=LEVEL
              Set log priority to LEVEL. The default log priority is ERROR. Possible values are : FA‐
              TAL, CRIT, WARN, ERROR, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG.

              Note that this option is setting the priority of the events log in  the  alternate  log
              file. It do not have effect on the ERROR events log on stderr.

       -n, --name=NAME
              Use  container  identifier  NAME.   The  container identifier format is an alphanumeric
              string.

       --rcfile=FILE
              Specify the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation  function‐
              alities for the container.

              This  configuration  file if present will be used even if there is already a configura‐
              tion file present in the previously created container (via lxc-create).

       --version
              Show the version number.

DIAGNOSTIC
       The container already exists
              As the message mention it, you try to create a container but there is a container  with
              the  same  name. You can use the lxc-ls command to list the available containers on the
              system.
