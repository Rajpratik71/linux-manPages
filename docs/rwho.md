RWHO(1)                                                     BSD General Commands Manual                                                    RWHO(1)

NAME
     rwho â€” who is logged in on local machines

SYNOPSIS
     rwho [-a]

DESCRIPTION
     The rwho command produces output similar to who, but for all machines on the local network.  If no report has been received from a machine
     for 11 minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known to be logged into that machine.

     If a users hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then rwho reports this idle time.  If a user hasn't typed to the system for an
     hour or more, then the user will be omitted from the output of rwho unless the -a flag is given.

FILES
     /var/spool/rwho/whod.*   information about other machines

HISTORY
     The rwho command appeared in 4.3BSD.

BUGS
     This is unwieldy when the number of machines on the local net is large.
