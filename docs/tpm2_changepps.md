NAME
       tpm2_changepps(1) - Replaces the active platform primary seed with a new one generated off the TPM2 RNG.

SYNOPSIS
       tpm2_changepps [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm2_changepps(1)  - Replaces the active platform primary seed with a new one generated off the TPM2 RNG.  The Transient and Persistent ob‐
       jects under the platform hierarchy are lost whilst retaining the NV objects.

OPTIONS
       • -p, --auth specifies the AUTH for the platform.  hierarchy.

Authorization Formatting
       Authorization for use of an object in TPM2.0 can come in 3 different forms: 1.  Password 2.  HMAC 3.  Sessions

       NOTE: “Authorizations default to the EMPTY PASSWORD when not specified”.

   Passwords
       Passwords are interpreted in the following forms below using prefix identifiers.

       Note: By default passwords are assumed to be in the string form when they do not have a prefix.

   String
       A string password, specified by prefix “str:” or it’s absence (raw string without prefix) is not interpreted, and is directly used for  au‐
       thorization.

   Examples
              foobar
              str:foobar

   Hex-string
       A hex-string password, specified by prefix “hex:” is converted from a hexidecimal form into a byte array form, thus allowing passwords with
       non-printable and/or terminal un-friendly characters.

   Example
              hex:0x1122334455667788

   File
       A file based password, specified be prefix “file:” should be the path of a file containing the password to be read by the tool or a “-”  to
       use  stdin.  Storing passwords in files prevents information leakage, passwords passed as options can be read from the process list or com‐
       mon shell history features.

   Examples
              # to use stdin and be prompted
              file:-

              # to use a file from a path
              file:path/to/password/file

              # to echo a password via stdin:
              echo foobar | tpm2_tool -p file:-

              # to use a bash here-string via stdin:

              tpm2_tool -p file:- <<< foobar

   Sessions
       When using a policy session to authorize the use of an object, prefix the option argument with the session keyword.  Then indicate  a  path
       to  a  session  file that was created with tpm2_startauthsession(1).  Optionally, if the session requires an auth value to be sent with the
       session handle (eg policy password), then append a + and a string as described in the Passwords section.

   Examples
       To use a session context file called session.ctx.

              session:session.ctx

       To use a session context file called session.ctx AND send the authvalue mypassword.

              session:session.ctx+mypassword

       To use a session context file called session.ctx AND send the HEX authvalue 0x11223344.

              session:session.ctx+hex:11223344

   PCR Authorizations
       You  can  satisfy  a  PCR  policy  using  the  “pcr:”  prefix  and  the  PCR  minilanguage.   The   PCR   minilanguage   is   as   follows:
       <pcr-spec>=<raw-pcr-file>

       The PCR spec is documented in in the section “PCR bank specifiers”.

       The raw-pcr-file is an optional the output of the raw PCR contents as returned by tpm2_pcrread(1).

       PCR bank specifiers (common/pcr.md)

   Examples
       To satisfy a PCR policy of sha256 on banks 0, 1, 2 and 3 use a specifier of:

              pcr:sha256:0,1,2,3

       specifying AUTH.

TCTI Configuration
       The  TCTI or “Transmission Interface” is the communication mechanism with the TPM.  TCTIs can be changed for communication with TPMs across
       different mediums.

       To control the TCTI, the tools respect:

       1. The command line option -T or --tcti

       2. The environment variable: TPM2TOOLS_TCTI.

       Note: The command line option always overrides the environment variable.

       The current known TCTIs are:

       • tabrmd - The resource manager, called tabrmd (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd).  Note that tabrmd and abrmd as  a  tcti  name
         are synonymous.

       • mssim - Typically used for communicating to the TPM software simulator.

       • device - Used when talking directly to a TPM device file.

       • none  -  Do not initalize a connection with the TPM.  Some tools allow for off-tpm options and thus support not using a TCTI.  Tools that
         do not support it will error when attempted to be used without a TCTI connection.  Does not support ANY options and MUST BE presented  as
         the exact text of “none”.

       The arguments to either the command line option or the environment variable are in the form:

       <tcti-name>:<tcti-option-config>

       Specifying  an  empty  string for either the <tcti-name> or <tcti-option-config> results in the default being used for that portion respec‐
       tively.

   TCTI Defaults
       When a TCTI is not specified, the default TCTI is searched for using dlopen(3) semantics.  The tools will search  for  tabrmd,  device  and
       mssim  TCTIs  IN  THAT  ORDER and USE THE FIRST ONE FOUND.  You can query what TCTI will be chosen as the default by using the -v option to
       print the version information.  The “default-tcti” key-value pair will indicate which of the aforementioned TCTIs is the default.

   Custom TCTIs
       Any TCTI that implements the dynamic TCTI interface can be loaded.  The tools internally use dlopen(3), and the raw tcti-name value is used
       for the lookup.  Thus, this could be a path to the shared library, or a library name as understood by dlopen(3) semantics.

TCTI OPTIONS
       This collection of options are used to configure the various known TCTI modules available:

       • device: For the device TCTI, the TPM character device file for use by the device TCTI can be specified.  The default is /dev/tpm0.

         Example: -T device:/dev/tpm0 or export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“device:/dev/tpm0”

       • mssim:  For  the  mssim  TCTI,  the  domain  name  or IP address and port number used by the simulator can be specified.  The default are
         127.0.0.1 and 2321.

         Example: -T mssim:host=localhost,port=2321 or export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“mssim:host=localhost,port=2321”

       • abrmd: For the abrmd TCTI, the configuration string format is a series of simple key value pairs separated by a `,' character.  Each  key
         and value string are separated by a `=' character.

         • TCTI abrmd supports two keys:

           1. `bus_name' : The name of the tabrmd service on the bus (a string).

           2. `bus_type' : The type of the dbus instance (a string) limited to `session' and `system'.

         Specify the tabrmd tcti name and a config string of bus_name=com.example.FooBar:

                \--tcti=tabrmd:bus_name=com.example.FooBar

         Specify the default (abrmd) tcti and a config string of bus_type=session:

                \--tcti:bus_type=session

         NOTE: abrmd and tabrmd are synonymous.  the various known TCTI modules.

EXAMPLES
   Change the platform primary seed where the platform auth is NULL.
              tpm2_changepps

Returns
       Tools can return any of the following codes:

       • 0 - Success.

       • 1 - General non-specific error.

       • 2 - Options handling error.

       • 3 - Authentication error.

       • 4 - TCTI related error.

       • 5 - Non supported scheme.  Applicable to tpm2_testparams.

Limitations
       It expects a session to be already established via tpm2_startauthsession(1) and requires one of the following:

       • direct device access

       • extended session support with tpm2-abrmd.

       Without it, most resource managers will not save session state between command invocations.
