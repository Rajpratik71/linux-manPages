NAME
       walldns-conf - sets up a DNS wall service.

SYNOPSIS
       walldns-conf acct logacct D ip

DESCRIPTION
       walldns-conf creates a service directory D that runs walldns(8).  The name D must start with a slash and must not contain any special char‚Äê
       acters.  Normally D is /etc/walldns.

       You can run the service under svscan(8) by using the update-service(8) program on Debian GNU/Linux

       update-service --add D

       or by creating a symbolic link in the svscan(8) directory (normally /service or /etc/service), e.g.:

       ln -s D /service

       The service will start within five seconds, and will be restarted upon reboot.  You can use svc(8) to control the service.

       walldns-conf arranges for walldns to chroot to D/root and to run under the uid and gid of acct.  The name acct must not contain any special
       characters.

       walldns-conf arranges for walldns(8) to listen for UDP packets on port 53 of ip, and to send outgoing packets from ip.

       walldns-conf  creates  an automatically rotated log directory in D/log/main.  The logs are owned by logacct.  The corresponding multilog(8)
       processes run under the uid and gid of logacct.  The name logacct must not contain any special characters.
