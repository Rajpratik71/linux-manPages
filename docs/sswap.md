SSWAP(1)                                                      General Commands Manual                                                     SSWAP(1)

NAME
       sswap - secure swap wiper (secure_deletion toolkit)

SYNOPSIS
       sswap [-f] [-l] [-l] [-v] [-z] swapdevice

DESCRIPTION
       sswap  is  designed  to  delete  data  which  may lie still on your swapspace in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thieves, law
       enforcement or other threats.  The wipe algorythm is based on the paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" pre‐
       sented at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The secure data deletion process of sswap goes like this:

       *      1 pass with 0xff

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       *      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -f     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize mode.

       -l     lessens the security. Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode with random values.

       -l     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one pass with random values is written.

       -v     verbose mode

       -z     wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

BEWARE
       swapoff
              unmount your swapspace before using this tool! Otherwise your system might crash!

       BETA!  sswap is still beta. It was only tested on Linux but on this system it performed it's work all of the time.

BUGS
       No  bugs.  There  was  never  a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew, good luck ;-) Send me any that you
       find.  Patches are nice too :)
