NOTES
       As  tartest  is  limited  to tests the data that is delivered by the tar archiver that is going to be checked, it cannot tests if the tar archiver in question will produce correct archives under all
       circumstances. There may be borderline cases that trigger bugs in the tar archiver.

       If you like to to a more complete test, you should have a look at the file READE.quicktest in the directory testscripts of either the star distribution or the ftp server.
