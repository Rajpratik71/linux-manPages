NAME
       abrt-harvest-pstoreoops - Reconstruct oops from /sys/fs/pstore/* files, create ABRT problems and remove the files

SYNOPSIS
       abrt-harvest-pstoreoops

DESCRIPTION
       This script is meant to be run once at system startup after abrtd is up and running. It scans /sys/fs/pstore/*, reconstructs oops text(s) from these files, creates ABRT problem directories from
       them, then removes the files (pstore storage is a limited resource).
