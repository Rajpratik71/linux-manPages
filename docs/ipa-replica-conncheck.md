NAME
       ipa-replica-conncheck - Check a replica-master network connection before installation

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-replica-conncheck [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       When  an  IPA  replica  is being installed a network connection between a replica machine and a replicated IPA master machine has to be prepared for master-replica communication. In case of a flawed
       connection the installation may fail with inconvenient error messages. A common connection problem is a misconfigured firewall with closed required port on a replica or master machine.

       The connection is checked by running a set of tests from both master and replica machines. The program is incorporated to ipa-replica-install(1) but can be also run separately.


OPTIONS
   REPLICA MACHINE OPTIONS
       This set of options is used when the connection check is run on a prepared IPA replica machine.

       -m MASTER, --master=MASTER
              Remote master machine address

       -a, --auto-master-check
              Automatically log in to master machine and execute the master machine part of the connection check. The following options for replica part are only evaluated when this option is set

       -r REALM, --realm=REALM
              The Kerberos realm name for the IPA server

       -k KDC, --kdc=KDC
              KDC server address. Defaults to MASTER

       -p PRINCIPAL, --principal=PRINCIPAL
              Authorized Kerberos principal to use to log in to master machine. Defaults to admin

       -w PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
              Password for given principal. The password will be prompted interactively when this option is missing


   MASTER MACHINE OPTIONS
       This set of options is used when the connection check is run on a master machine against a running ipa-replica-conncheck(1) on a replica machine.

       -R REPLICA, --replica=REPLICA
              Remote replica machine address


   COMMON OPTIONS
       -c, --check-ca
              Include in a check also a set of dogtag connection requirements. Only needed when the master was installed with Dogtag 9 or lower.

       -h HOSTNAME, --hostname=HOSTNAME
              The hostname of this server (FQDN). By default the result of getfqdn() call from Python's socket module is used.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information

       -q, --quiet
              Output only errors


EXAMPLES
       ipa-replica-conncheck -m master.example.com
              Run a replica machine connection check against a remote master master.example.com. If the connection to the remote master machine is successful the program will switch to listening  mode  and
              prompt for running the master machine part. The second part check the connection from master to replica.

       ipa-replica-conncheck -R replica.example.com
              Run  a  master  machine connection check part. This is either run automatically by replica part of the connection check program (when -a option is set) or manually by the user. A running ipa-
              replica-conncheck(1) in a listening mode must be already running on a replica machine.

       ipa-replica-conncheck -m master.example.com -a -r EXAMPLE.COM -w password
              Run a replica-master connection check. In case of a success switch to listening mode, automatically log to master.example.com in a realm EXAMPLE.COM with a password password and run the  sec‚Äê
              ond part of the connection check.


EXIT STATUS
       0 if the connection check was successful

       1 if an error occurred
