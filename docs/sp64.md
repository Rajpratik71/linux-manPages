NAME
       sp64 - word generator based on per-position Markov chains

SYNOPSIS
       sp64 [options]... hcstat-file [filter-mask]

DESCRIPTION
       Statsprocessor  is  a  word  generator based on per-position Markov chains packed into a single stand-alone binary. The resulting words can
       then, for example, be postprocessed and fed into Hashcat or other password recovery tools.

       sp by atom, High-Performance word generator based on hashcat markov stats

       * Startup:

       -V,  --version
              Print version

       -h,  --help
              Print help

       * Increment:

       --pw-min=NUM
              Start incrementing at NUM

       --pw-max=NUM
              Stop incrementing at NUM

       * Markov:

       --markov-disable
              Emulates maskprocessor output

       --markov-classic
              No per-position tables

       --threshold=NUM
              Filter out chars after NUM chars added Set to 0 to disable

       * Misc:

       --combinations
              Calculate number of combinations

       --hex-charset
              Assume charset is given in hex

       * Resources:

       -s,  --skip=NUM
              skip number of words (for restore)

       -l,  --limit=NUM
              limit number of words (for distributed)

       * Files:

       -o,  --output-file=FILE
              Output-file

       * Custom charsets:

       -1,  --custom-charset1=CS
              User-defineable charsets

       -2,  --custom-charset2=CS
              Example:

       -3,  --custom-charset3=CS  --custom-charset1=?dabcdef

       -4,  --custom-charset4=CS
              sets charset ?1 to 0123456789abcdef

       * Built-in charsets:

              ?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ?d = 0123456789 ?s =  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ ?a = ?l?u?d?s
              ?h  = 8 bit characters from 0xc0 - 0xff ?D = 8 bit characters from german alphabet ?F = 8 bit characters from french alphabet ?R = 8
              bit characters from russian alphabet

EXAMPLE
       The following example was made just to see what comes out of statsprocessor.

       $ ./sp64.bin --pw-min 5 --pw-max 5 hashcat.hcstat ?l?l?l?l?l | head -9

       In Markov chains we have a statistic generated which letter is following which letter based on the analysis of the original  input  dictio‚Äê
       nary used to generate the .hcstat. In this case the most used letter on the first position is the letter "s". The program then looks up the
       Markov table with the key "s" to get the most used letter after the letter "s" on position 0. In our case, it's the letter "a". This  chain
       continues until the end of the word, iterating through all letters stored in the Markov table.
