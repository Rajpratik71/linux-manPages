NAME
       Firemon - Monitoring program for processes started in a Firejail sandbox.

SYNOPSIS
       firemon [OPTIONS] [PID]

DESCRIPTION
       Firemon monitors programs started in a Firejail sandbox.  Without a PID specified, all processes started by Firejail are monitored. Descen‐
       dants of these processes are also being monitored. On Grsecurity systems only root user can run this program.

OPTIONS
       --apparmor
              Print AppArmor confinement status for each sandbox.

       --arp  Print ARP table for each sandbox.

       --caps Print capabilities configuration for each sandbox.

       --cgroup
              Print control group information for each sandbox.

       --cpu  Print CPU affinity for each sandbox.

       --debug
              Print debug messages

       -?, --help
              Print options end exit.

       --interface
              Print network interface information for each sandbox.

       --list List all sandboxes.

       --name=name
              Print information only about named sandbox.

       --netstats
              Monitor network statistics for sandboxes creating a new network namespace.

       --nowrap
              Enable line wrapping in terminals. By default the lines are trimmed.

       --route
              Print route table for each sandbox.

       --seccomp
              Print seccomp configuration for each sandbox.

       --top  Monitor the most CPU-intensive sandboxes. This command  is similar to the regular UNIX top command, however it applies only to sand‐
              boxes.

       --tree Print a tree of all sandboxed processes.

       --version
              Print program version and exit.

       --x11  Print X11 display number.

       The format for each listed sandbox entry is as follows:

            PID:USER:Sandbox Name:Command

       Listed below are the available fields (columns) in various firemon commands in alphabetical order:

       Command
              Command used to start the sandbox.

       CPU%   CPU usage, the sandbox share of the elapsed CPU time since the last screen update

       PID    Unique process ID for the task controlling the sandbox.

       Prcs   Number of processes running in sandbox, including the controlling process.

       RES    Resident  Memory  Size  (KiB),  sandbox non-swapped physical memory.  It is a sum of the RES values for all processes running in the
              sandbox.

       Sandbox Name
              The name of the sandbox, if any.

       SHR    Shared Memory Size (KiB), it reflects memory shared with other processes. It is a sum of the SHR values for all processes running in
              the sandbox, including the controlling process.

       Uptime Sandbox running time in hours:minutes:seconds format.

       USER   The owner of the sandbox.
