NAME
       mesongui - a gui for the Meson build system

DESCRIPTION
       Mesongui provides a graphical user interface to the Meson build system. It can be used for two main purposes: configuring an existing build
       or creating a new build for the given source.

       mesongui [ source or build directory ]

       If the argument is a directory with a Meson project, the Gui will allow you to configure and generate a build tree for it.

       If the argument is an existing build directory, Mesongui will start a gui that will show all your configuration options and allows  you  to
       change them as desired. The gui can also be used to build and install the project.
