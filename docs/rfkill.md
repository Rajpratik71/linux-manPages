NAME
       rfkill - tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices

SYNOPSIS
       rfkill [options] [command] [id|type ...]

DESCRIPTION
       rfkill lists, enabling and disabling wireless devices.

       The command "list" output format is deprecated and maintained for backward compatibility only. The new output format is the default when no command is specified or when the option --output is
       used.

       The default output is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always explicitly define expected columns by using the --output option
       together with a columns list in environments where a stable output is required.

OPTIONS
       -J, --json
              Use JSON output format.

       -n, --noheadings
              Do not print a header line.

       -o, --output
              Specify which output columns to print.  Use --help to get a list of available columns.

       -r, --raw
              Use the raw output format.

       --help Display help text and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

COMMANDS
       help   Display help text and exit.

       event  Listen for rfkill events and display them on stdout.

       list [id|type ...]
              List  the  current state of all available devices.  The command output format is deprecated, see the section DESCRIPTION.  It is a good idea to check with list command id or type scope
              is appropriate before setting block or unblock.  Special all type string will match everything.  Use of multiple id or type arguments is supported.

       block id|type [...]
              Disable the corresponding device.

       unblock id|type [...]
              Enable the corresponding device.  If the device is hard-blocked, for example via a hardware switch, it will remain unavailable though it is now soft-unblocked.

EXAMPLES
       rfkill --output ID,TYPE
       rfkill block all
       rfkill unblock wlan
       rfkill block bluetooth uwb wimax wwan gps fm nfc
