NAME
       festival - a text-to-speech system.

SYNOPSIS
       festival [options] [file0] [file1] ...



DESCRIPTION
       Festival  is  a  general purpose text-to-speech system.  As well as simply rendering text as speech it can be used in an interactive command mode for testing and developing various aspects of speech
       synthesis technology.

       Festival has two major modes, command and tts (text-to-speech).  When in command mode input (from file or interactively) is interpreted by the command interpreter.  When in tts mode  input  is  ren‚Äê
       dered as speech.  When in command mode filenames that start with a left paranthesis are treated as literal commands and evaluated.

BUGS
       More than you can imagine.

       A manual with much detail (though not complete) is available in distributed as part of the system and is also accessible at
       http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/manual/

       Although we cannot guarantee the time required to fix bugs, we would appreciated it if they were reported to
       festival-bug@cstr.ed.ac.uk
