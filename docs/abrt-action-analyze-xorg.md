NAME
       abrt-action-analyze-xorg - Calculate and save UUID and duplicate hash for a problem data directory DIR with Xorg backtrace.

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       The tool reads the file named Xorg.0.log and checks if any black listed module was loaded. If so, not-reportable file is created with an appropriate explanation text. If no black listed module was
       loaded, the tool reads the file named backtrace from a problem data directory record and generates a duplication hash and a universally unique identifier (UUID). Then it saves this data as new
       elements duphash and uuid.

   Integration with ABRT events
       abrt-action-analyze-xorg can be used to generate the duplication hash of a newly discovered Xorg backtraces.
