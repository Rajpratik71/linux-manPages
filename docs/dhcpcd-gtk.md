NAME
     dhcpcd-gtk â€” a GTK+ frontend for network configuration

DESCRIPTION
     dhcpcd-gtk is a GTK+ frontend for network configuration.  It uses dhcpcd(8) as the backend and communicates to it and optionally
     wpa_supplicant(8) via dhcpcd_dbus.

   wpa_supplicant
     dhcpcd-gtk relies on wpa_supplicant(8) being configured to write its sockets to /var/run/wpa_supplicant. dhcpcd-gtk relies on
     wpa_supplicant(8) being started by the operating system.  If dhcpcd-gtk is used to select and set pass phrases for wireless networks then
     update_config=1 needs to be set in wpa_supplicant.conf.

SEE ALSO
     dhcpcd(8), wpa_supplicant(8), wpa_supplicant.conf(5)
