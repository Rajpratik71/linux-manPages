DESCRIPTION
       finddup search the working directory and all files below on the same partition for duplicate files.

       finddup can optional hardlink such files to save space.

       Files size 0 will not be reported or hardlinked as this might give problemes later.

       This is a complete rewrite of the finddup in perl to handle several issues:

         - Allow spaces and other characters in filenames

         - be faster

         - include nodup in same script

         - Handle files that already have other hardlinks in the same tree

         - Several improvements

       If started as nodup or nodup.pl the script will act like started with options --link and --oldresult
