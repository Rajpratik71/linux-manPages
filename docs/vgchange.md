DESCRIPTION
       vgchange  allows  you  to  change the attributes of one or more volume groups. Its main purpose is to activate and deactivate VolumeGroupName, or all volume groups if none is specified.  Only active
       volume groups are subject to changes and allow access to their logical volumes.  [Not yet implemented: During volume group activation, if vgchange recognizes  snapshot  logical  volumes  which  were
       dropped because they ran out of space, it displays a message informing the administrator that such snapshots should be removed (see lvremove(8)).  ]

OPTIONS
       See lvm(8) for common options.

       -A, --autobackup {y|n}
              Controls automatic backup of metadata after the change.  See vgcfgbackup(8).  Default is yes.

       -a, --activate [a|e|l]{y|n}
              Controls  the  availability  of  the logical volumes in the volume group for input/output.  In other words, makes the logical volumes known/unknown to the kernel.  If autoactivation option is
              used (-aay), each logical volume in the volume group is activated only if it matches an item in the activation/auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf. If this list is not set,  then  all
              volumes  are  considered for activation.  The -aay option should be also used during system boot so it's possible to select which volumes to activate using the activation/auto_activation_vol-
              ume_list settting.

              Activation of a logical volume creates a symbolic link /dev/VolumeGroupName/LogicalVolumeName pointing to the device node.  This link is removed on deactivation.   All  software  and  scripts
              should access the device through this symbolic link and present this as the name of the device.  The location and name of the underlying device node may depend on the distribution and config-
              uration (e.g. udev) and might change from release to release.

              If clustered locking is enabled, add 'e' to activate/deactivate exclusively on one node or 'l' to activate/deactivate only on the local node.  Logical volumes with single-host  snapshots  are
              always activated exclusively because they can only be used on one node at once.

       --activationmode {complete|degraded|partial}
              The  activation  mode  determines  whether  logical  volumes are allowed to activate when there are physical volumes missing (e.g. due to a device failure).  complete is the most restrictive;
              allowing only those logical volumes to be activated that are not affected by the missing PVs.  degraded allows RAID logical volumes to be activated even if they have PVs missing.  (Note  that
              the  "mirror" segment type is not considered a RAID logical volume.  The "raid1" segment type should be used instead.)  Finally, partial allows any logical volume to be activated even if por-
              tions are missing due to a missing or failed PV.  This last option should only be used when performing recovery or repair operations.  degraded is the default  mode.   To  change  it,  modify
              activation_mode in lvm.conf(5).

       -K, --ignoreactivationskip
              Ignore the flag to skip Logical Volumes during activation.

       -c, --clustered {y|n}
              If  clustered  locking is enabled, this indicates whether this Volume Group is shared with other nodes in the cluster or whether it contains only local disks that are not visible on the other
              nodes.  If the cluster infrastructure is unavailable on a particular node at a particular time, you may still be able to use Volume Groups that are not marked as clustered.

       --detachprofile
              Detach any metadata configuration profiles attached to given Volume Groups. See lvm.conf(5) for more information about metadata profiles.

       -u, --uuid
              Generate new random UUID for specified Volume Groups.

       --monitor {y|n}
              Start or stop monitoring a mirrored or snapshot logical volume with dmeventd, if it is installed.  If a device used by a monitored mirror reports an I/O error, the failure is handled  accord-
              ing to mirror_image_fault_policy and mirror_log_fault_policy set in lvm.conf(5).

       --poll {y|n}
              Without  polling  a  logical  volume's  backgrounded  transformation process will never complete.  If there is an incomplete pvmove or lvconvert (for example, on rebooting after a crash), use
              --poll y to restart the process from its last checkpoint.  However, it may not be appropriate to immediately poll a logical volume when it is activated, use --poll n to defer and then  --poll
              y to restart the process.

       --sysinit
              Indicates  that  vgchange(8)  is being invoked from early system initialisation scripts (e.g. rc.sysinit or an initrd), before writeable filesystems are available. As such, some functionality
              needs to be disabled and this option acts as a shortcut which selects an appropriate set of options. Currently this is equivalent to using --ignorelockingfailure, --ignoremonitoring, --poll n
              and setting LVM_SUPPRESS_LOCKING_FAILURE_MESSAGES environment variable.

              If  --sysinit  is  used  in  conjunction  with  lvmetad(8) enabled and running, autoactivation is preferred over manual activation via direct vgchange call.  Logical volumes are autoactivated
              according to auto_activation_volume_list set in lvm.conf(5).

       --noudevsync
              Disable udev synchronisation. The process will not wait for notification from udev.  It will continue irrespective of any possible udev processing in the background.  You should only use this
              if udev is not running or has rules that ignore the devices LVM2 creates.

       --ignoremonitoring
              Make no attempt to interact with dmeventd unless --monitor is specified.  Do not use this if dmeventd is already monitoring a device.

       -l, --logicalvolume MaxLogicalVolumes
              Changes the maximum logical volume number of an existing inactive volume group.

       -p, --maxphysicalvolumes MaxPhysicalVolumes
              Changes  the maximum number of physical volumes that can belong to this volume group.  For volume groups with metadata in lvm1 format, the limit is 255.  If the metadata uses lvm2 format, the
              value 0 removes this restriction: there is then no limit.  If you have a large number of physical volumes in a volume group with metadata in lvm2 format, for  tool  performance  reasons,  you
              should consider some use of --pvmetadatacopies 0 as described in pvcreate(8), and/or use --vgmetadatacopies.

       --metadataprofile ProfileName
              Uses and attaches ProfileName configuration profile to the volume group metadata. Whenever the volume group is processed next time, the profile is automatically applied. The profile is inher-
              ited by all logical volumes in the volume group unless the logical volume itself has its own profile attached. See lvm.conf(5) for more information about metadata profiles.

       --[vg]metadatacopies NumberOfCopies|unmanaged|all
              Sets the desired number of metadata copies in the volume group.  If set to a non-zero value, LVM will automatically manage the 'metadataignore' flags on the physical volumes (see pvchange  or
              pvcreate  --metadataignore) in order to achieve NumberOfCopies copies of metadata.  If set to unmanaged, LVM will not automatically manage the 'metadataignore' flags.  If set to all, LVM will
              first clear all of the 'metadataignore' flags on all metadata areas in the volume group, then set the value to unmanaged.  The vgmetadatacopies option is useful for volume  groups  containing
              large numbers of physical volumes with metadata as it may be used to minimize metadata read and write overhead.

       -s, --physicalextentsize PhysicalExtentSize[BbBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE]
              Changes  the  physical  extent  size  on  physical  volumes  of this volume group.  A size suffix (k for kilobytes up to t for terabytes) is optional, megabytes is the default if no suffix is
              present.  For LVM2 format, the value must be a power of 2 of at least 1 sector (where the sector size is the largest sector size of the PVs currently used in the VG) or, if not a power of  2,
              at least 128KiB.  For the older LVM1 format, it must be a power of 2 of at least 8KiB.  The default is 4 MiB.

              Before  increasing  the physical extent size, you might need to use lvresize, pvresize and/or pvmove so that everything fits.  For example, every contiguous range of extents used in a logical
              volume must start and end on an extent boundary.

              If the volume group metadata uses lvm1 format, extents can vary in size from 8KiB to 16GiB and there is a limit of 65534 extents in each logical volume.  The default of 4 MiB leads to a maxi-
              mum logical volume size of around 256GiB.

              If the volume group metadata uses lvm2 format those restrictions do not apply, but having a large number of extents will slow down the tools but have no impact on I/O performance to the logi-
              cal volume.  The smallest PE is 1KiB.

              The 2.4 kernel has a limitation of 2TiB per block device.

       --systemid SystemID
              Changes the system ID of the VG.  Using this option requires caution because the VG may become foreign to the host running the command, leaving the host unable  to  access  it.   See  lvmsys-
              temid(7).

       --refresh
              If any logical volume in the volume group is active, reload its metadata.  This is not necessary in normal operation, but may be useful if something has gone wrong or if you're doing cluster-
              ing manually without a clustered lock manager.

       -x, --resizeable {y|n}
              Enables or disables the extension/reduction of this volume group with/by physical volumes.

Examples
       To activate all known volume groups in the system:

       vgchange -a y

       To change the maximum number of logical volumes of inactive volume group vg00 to 128.

       vgchange -l 128 /dev/vg00
