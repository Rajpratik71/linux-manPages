NAME
       xkbprint - print an XKB keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       xkbprint [options] source [ output_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xkbprint command generates a printable or encapsulated PostScript description of the XKB keyboard description specified by source.  The source can be any compiled keymap (.xkm) file that
       includes a geometry description or an X display specification.  If an output_file is specified, xkbprint writes to it.  If no output file is specified, xkbprint creates replaces the extension
       of  the source file with .ps or .eps depending on the requested format.  If the source is a non-local X display (e.g.:0), xkbprint appends the appropriate prefix to the display specification,
       replacing the colon with a dash.  For a local display, xkprint uses server-n where n is the number of the display.
