NAME
       pcapfix - repair pcap and pcapng files

SYNOPSIS
       pcapfix [-d] [-n] [-o filename] [-t DATA_LINK_TYPE] [-v] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Pcapfix  is  a tool to repair your damaged or corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It is written in C and released under the GNU General Public
       License.

       To fix your pcap files the tool first checks for an intact pcap global header and repairs it if there are some corrupted  bytes.  It  there
       seems  to be no global header at all, pcapfix adds a self-created one at the beginning of the file. In a second step the tool tries to find
       pcap packet headers inside the file, below the global header. It checks if the values are correct (or seem to  be  correct)  and  tries  to
       repair a packet if there is something wrong.

       To  fix  your  pcapng files the tool loops through all packet headers that can be found in the file. It checks for mandatory Section Header
       and Interface Description Block and creates them if missing. Pcapfix checks for correct block sizes and valid option fields.  If  something
       is wrong, invalid fields are repaired (if possible) or skipped and adjusted to finally get a proper pcapng file.

OPTIONS
       -d, --deep-scan
            Force deep scan (default = 0)
            This option will force pcapfix to scan for any packet inside the whole file (instead of the first 65535 bytes only).

       -n, --pcapng
            Force File Format to PCAPNG (default = 0)
            This option will force pcapfix to repair the input file as it were in pcapng format (useful for destroyed file headers).

       -o, --outfile <filename>
            Set the output file name. Default will be input file prepended by "fixed_".

       -t, --data-link-type <nr>
            Data Link Type (default = 1)
            (See NOTES section below.)

       -v, --verbose
            Enable verbose output (default = 0)
            You can use multiple -v options to increase verbosity.
            An verbosity of 2 will result in very much output data during package search.

EXAMPLES
       Repair the pcap file using deep scan mode, because large blocks of the file are corrupted.
            pcapfix -d file.pcap

       Repair the file damaged_file.pcapng using verbose output.
            pcapfix -v damaged_file.pcapng

       Repair the file wlan_traffic.pcap and force the data link type to be 119 (PRISM HEADER).
            pcapfix -t 119 wlan_traffic.pcap

       Repair the file damaged.pcapng which file header is corrupted and force its format to be pcapng.
            pcapfix -n damaged.pcapng

NOTES
       Deep scan

            In  classic pcap files, pcapfix will only scan the first 65536 bytes (maximum packet length) for a proper first packet. If you want to
            force packet detection even above this limit (e.g. because your file has been heavily destroyed) you can  use  the  deep  scan  option
            (-d).

            This  option is not necessary for pcapng files because the whole file is arranged in blocks that are 'unlimited' by default. In result
            pcapfix will always scan the whole pcapng file for further blocks.

       PCAPNG Format

            Pcapfix will try to identify the file format to repair (pcap / pcapng) before doing any further checks. If the header itself  is  cor‐
            rupted, it will assume the format to be classic pcap. To change this behaviour you can force the tool to do a pcapng-repair by supply‐
            ing -n (--pcapng) option.

       Verbosity

            You can use multiple -v options to increase verbosity. An verbosity of 2 will result in very much output data during package search.

       ASCII-mode transferred Files (FTP)

            Pcapfix is able to repair pcap files that have been transferred in ascii-mode via FTP. In those files a proper pcap structure will  be
            created  only to make them readable by wireshark etc. The data inside the packets (and some pcap headers) might still be corrupted. To
            repair those packets a deeper look inside the packet structure (e.g. checksum) will be necessary.

       Data Link Types

            You can make pcapfix change / select your data link type by supplying -t option. Although you may  select  a  data  link  type  number
            between 0 and 255, only the following types are assigned: If the data link type field is corrupt, pcapfix will selct LINKTYPE_ETHERNET
            by default.

DEVELOPMENT
       This tool is still under development! Please send any  further  wishes,  feature  requests  or  problems  in  compiling  and  execution  to
       ruport@f00l.de. Additionally You may send me pcap/pcapng files that could not be repaired too in order to improve pcapfix and get your file
       repaired.

       For further information visit the pcapfix homepage at http://f00l.de/pcapfix/.
