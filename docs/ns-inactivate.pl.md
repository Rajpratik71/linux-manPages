NAME
       ns-inactivate.pl - Directory Server perl script for inactivating entries.

SYNOPSIS
       ns-inactivate.pl [-Z serverID] [-D rootdn] { -w password | -w - | -j filename } [-p port] [-h host] [-P protocol] -I DN

DESCRIPTION
       Inactivates, and consequently locks, an entry or group of entries.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below:

       -Z Server Identifier
              The server ID of the Directory Server instance.  If there is only one instance on the system, this option can be skipped.

       -D Root DN
              The Directory Manager DN, or root DN.  If not specified, the script will search the server instance configuration for the value.

       -w password
              The rootdn password.

       -w -
              Prompt for the rootdn password.

       -j password filename
              The name of the file that contains the root DN password.

       -P Protocol
              The  connection  protocol  to connect to the Directory Server.  Protocols are STARTTLS, LDAPS, LDAPI, and LDAP.  If this option is skipped, the most secure protocol that is available is used.
              For LDAPI, AUTOBIND is also available for the root user.

       -I DN  Specifies the entry DN or role DN to deactivate.

       -h host
              Host name of the Directory Server.

       -p port
              Port number of the Directory Server.

EXAMPLE
       ns-inactivate.pl -Z instance2 -D 'cn=directory manager' -j /tmp/passwd.txt -P STARTTLS -I 'uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'

              Note: security must be enabled to use protocol STARTTLS.  If STARTTLS is not available it will default to next strongest/available protocol automatically.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
