NAME
       rephrase - Specialized passphrase recovery tool for GnuPG

DESCRIPTION
       rephrase  is  a specialized passphrase recovery tool for GnuPG. If you can nearly remember your GnuPG passphrase - but not quite - then Re‐
       phrase may be able to help.

       Tell Rephrase the parts of the passphrase you know, and any number of alternatives for the parts you're not sure about; and  Rephrase  will
       try  all  the  alternatives,  in  all possible combinations, and tell you which combination (if any) gives you the correct passphrase.  You
       could try all the combinations yourself, of course, if there are just a handful of them; but if there are more, that might be impractical.

       On the other hand, if you need to try a huge number of possible passphrases, Rephrase might be too slow; it is far from being an  efficient
       passphrase  cracker.   E.g.  Rephrase  can try out about 2600 possible passphrases per minute on my 1GHz Athlon (with other processes doing
       nothing very heavy at the same time).  How many passphrases Rephrase can try depends on how long you are prepared to  wait!   Rephrase  can
       reasonably be run for a long time; e.g. it *won't* use more memory the longer it runs.

       It would be a Bad Thing to leave your passphrase (or part of it, or your guesses at it) lying around on your hard drive; since a passphrase
       is supposed to be an extra line of defence if an attacker obtains access to your secret keyring (which you presumably  *do*  keep  on  your
       hard  drive).   That's  why Rephrase keeps all the information about your passphrase that you give it in secure memory (and then pipes each
       possible passphrase to a child gpg process).  For this reason, Rephrase is likely to be more secure than alternative solutions that involve
       generating a list of possible passphrases in a file and then testing them.

       [1] For more information about GnuPG, see http://www.gnupg.org/ .

USAGE
       rephrase <key>

       where  <key> is the key whose passphrase you want to recover; you can identify the key in any of the ways that GnuPG understands.  (To make
       sure you're using a sensible value for <key>, you could first try

           gpg --list-secret-keys <key>

       which should list exactly 1 key.)

       You will be prompted to enter a pattern (the pattern is not echoed to the screen as you type it).  So what's a pattern?  Suppose  you  know
       that  your  passphrase was something like "super-secret", but you're not sure if you changed some (or all) of the "e"s into "3"s, or any of
       the consonants into upper case, or indeed changed the "c" into "k" or "K" or even "|<", or changed the "-" into " "  or  just  omitted  it.
       Then you could enter this pattern:

           (s|S)u(p|P)(e|3)(r|R)(-| |)(s|S)(e|3)(c|C|k|K|\|<)(r|R)(e|3)(t|T)

       The  pattern  is your passphrase - except that 4 characters have special meanings.  Brackets - "(" and ")" - are used to group alternatives
       wherever you're not sure what characters are correct; "|" is used inside a pair of brackets to separate the alternatives; and "\"  is  used
       to escape any of the 4 special characters when you need to use it literally.

       Rephrase  will tell you if your pattern contains a syntax error.  That happens if there are unbalanced brackets (i.e. they aren't in proper
       pairs); or if the pattern ends with "\" (because then there's nothing for it to escape).  It also happens (and these cases are  limitations
       in  Rephrase's  simple  pattern parser) if you try to nest pairs of brackets; or if you try to use "|" anywhere that's not inside a pair of
       brackets.

       If the pattern contains no syntax errors, Rephrase will try each possible  passphrase  matching  the  pattern  in  turn.   If  the  correct
       passphrase is found, Rephrase won't actually tell you what it is (in case someone's looking over your shoulder), but will tell you a string
       of numbers: you can work out the correct passphrase from these numbers and the pattern you entered.  E.g.

                  2 1 2 1 2 1 1 5 1 2 2

       The first number - 2 - means that at the first pair of brackets in the pattern - "(s|S)" - you must take the second alternative - viz. "S".
       The  second  number  -  1  - means that at the seconds pair of brackets - "(p|P)" - you must take the first alternative - viz. "p".  And so
       forth.  So in this case the correct passphrase is "Sup3r se|<r3T".

       If the correct passphrase is not found from the pattern, Rephrase tells you so.  (Note that you will also get this result if you  specified
       <key> incorretly; how to check that the value of <key> is OK is explained above.)

       Rephrase's exit status is 0 is the passphrase is found, 1 if it's not found, or other values if an error occurs.

SECURITY
       The  good news is that Rephrase uses mlock() in order to keep the information about passphrases that it's given as secure as possible.  The
       bad news is that using mlock() requires root privileges, so Rephrase needs to be setuid root.  However, it does drop root  privileges  very
       quickly, as soon as it has called mlock().

       It's  also  debatable  whether  mlock() is a proper way to protect sensitive information.  According to POSIX, mlock()ing a page guarantees
       that it *is* in memory (useful for realtime applications), not that it *isn't* in the swap (useful for security applications).  Possibly an
       encrypted  swap  partition (or no swap partition) is a better solution.  Anyway, GnuPG itself uses mlock(), which makes it sensible for Re‐
       phrase to follow suit.

BUGS
       Portability is untested: I have only used Rephrase on a GNU/Linux system (Linux 2.4.21 and Glibc 2.3.2; building with GNU Make 3.79.1, bash
       2.05  (as  /bin/sh)  and  either GCC 2.95.3 or GCC 3.3).  I believe setreuid() is a BSD-ism, so it may not exist on more SysV-like systems.
       There are probably many other issues.

       If mlock() fails (probably because Rephrase is not setuid root), Rephrase refuses to proceed: it would be better to  issue  a  warning  and
       continue, since that's what GnuPG does.

       Before  it  asks  you  to  enter  a pattern, Rephrase should check that the <key> argument does refer to exactly 1 key and that that key is
       available.

       If you'd like Rephrase to be faster, then it's too slow.  (But if you're happy with it, then it's fast enough.)

       The standard --version and --help options are unimplemented.
