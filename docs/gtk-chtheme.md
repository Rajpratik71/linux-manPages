NAME
       gtk-chtheme - Gtk+ 2.0 theme preview and selection made slick.

SYNOPSIS
       gtk-chtheme

DESCRIPTION
       As the name suggests, this little program lets you change your Gtk+ 2.0 theme.  The aim is to make theme preview and selection as slick as
       possible. Themes installed on the system are presented for selection and previewed on the fly.  A large variety of widgets provides a com‐
       prehensive demonstration.

BUGS
       The .gtkrc-2.0 parser is somewhat shaky, but this shouldn't affect anyone.
