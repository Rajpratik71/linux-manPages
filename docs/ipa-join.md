NAME
       ipa-join - Join a machine to an IPA realm and get a keytab for the host service principal

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-join [-d|--debug] [-q|--quiet] [-u|--unenroll] [-h|--hostname hostname] [-s|--server hostname] [-k|--keytab filename] [-w|--bindpw password] [-b|--basedn basedn] [-?|--help] [--usage]


DESCRIPTION
       Joins a host to an IPA realm and retrieves a kerberos keytab for the host service principal, or unenrolls an enrolled host from an IPA server.

       Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to perform kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one or more secrets (or keys) for a kerberos principal.

       The  ipa-join  command  will  create  and  retrieve a service principal for host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM and place it by default into /etc/krb5.keytab. The location can be overridden with the -k
       option.

       The IPA server to contact is set in /etc/ipa/default.conf by default and can be overridden using the -s,--server option.

       In order to join the machine needs to be authenticated. This can happen in one of two ways:

       * Authenticate using the current kerberos principal

       * Provide a password to authenticate with

       If a client host has already been joined to the IPA realm the ipa-join command will fail. The host will need to be removed from the server using `ipa host-del FQDN` in order to join  the  client  to
       the realm.

       This command is normally executed by the ipa-client-install command as part of the enrollment process.

       The reverse is unenrollment. Unenrolling a host removes the Kerberos key on the IPA server. This prepares the host to be re-enrolled. This uses the host principal stored in /etc/krb5.conf to authen‚Äê
       ticate to the IPA server to perform the unenrollment.

       Please note, that while the ipa-join option removes the client from the domain, it does not actually uninstall the client or properly remove all of the IPA-related configuration.  The  only  way  to
       uninstall a client completely is to use ipa-client-install --uninstall (see ipa-client-install(1)).


OPTIONS
       -h,--hostname hostname
              The hostname of this server (FQDN). By default of nodename from uname(2) is used.

       -s,--server server
              The hostname of the IPA server (FQDN). Note that by default there is no /etc/ipa/default.conf, in most cases it needs to be supplied.

       -k,--keytab keytab-file
              The keytab file where to append the new key (will be created if it does not exist). Default: /etc/krb5.keytab

       -w,--bindpw password
              The password to use if not using Kerberos to authenticate. Use a password of this particular host (one time password created on IPA server)

       -b,--basedn basedn
              The basedn of the IPA server (of the form dc=example,dc=com). This is only needed when not using Kerberos to authenticate and anonymous binds are disallowed in the IPA LDAP server.

       -f,--force
              Force enrolling the host even if host entry exists.

       -u,--unenroll
              Unenroll this host from the IPA server. No keytab entry is removed in the process (see ipa-rmkeytab(1)).

       -q,--quiet
              Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.

       -d,--debug
              Print the raw XML-RPC output in GSSAPI mode.

EXAMPLES
       Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab with kerberos credentials.

         # kinit admin
         # ipa-join

       Join IPA domain and retrieve a keytab using a one-time password.

         # ipa-join -w secret123

       Join IPA domain and save the keytab in another location.

         # ipa-join -k /tmp/host.keytab

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is 0 on success, nonzero on error.

       0 Success

       19 Unable to generate Kerberos credentials cache

       20 Unenrollment result not in XML-RPC response

       21 Failed to get default Kerberos realm
