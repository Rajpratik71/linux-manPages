PG_CONFIG(1)                                               PostgreSQL 11.4 Documentation                                              PG_CONFIG(1)

NAME
       pg_config - retrieve information about the installed version of PostgreSQL

SYNOPSIS
       pg_config [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       The pg_config utility prints configuration parameters of the currently installed version of PostgreSQL. It is intended, for example, to be
       used by software packages that want to interface to PostgreSQL to facilitate finding the required header files and libraries.

OPTIONS
       To use pg_config, supply one or more of the following options:

       --bindir
           Print the location of user executables. Use this, for example, to find the psql program. This is normally also the location where the
           pg_config program resides.

       --docdir
           Print the location of documentation files.

       --htmldir
           Print the location of HTML documentation files.

       --includedir
           Print the location of C header files of the client interfaces.

       --pkgincludedir
           Print the location of other C header files.

       --includedir-server
           Print the location of C header files for server programming.

       --libdir
           Print the location of object code libraries.

       --pkglibdir
           Print the location of dynamically loadable modules, or where the server would search for them. (Other architecture-dependent data files
           might also be installed in this directory.)

       --localedir
           Print the location of locale support files. (This will be an empty string if locale support was not configured when PostgreSQL was
           built.)

       --mandir
           Print the location of manual pages.

       --sharedir
           Print the location of architecture-independent support files.

       --sysconfdir
           Print the location of system-wide configuration files.

       --pgxs
           Print the location of extension makefiles.

       --configure
           Print the options that were given to the configure script when PostgreSQL was configured for building. This can be used to reproduce
           the identical configuration, or to find out with what options a binary package was built. (Note however that binary packages often
           contain vendor-specific custom patches.) See also the examples below.

       --cc
           Print the value of the CC variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows the C compiler used.

       --cppflags
           Print the value of the CPPFLAGS variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler switches needed at preprocessing
           time (typically, -I switches).

       --cflags
           Print the value of the CFLAGS variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows C compiler switches.

       --cflags_sl
           Print the value of the CFLAGS_SL variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows extra C compiler switches used for building
           shared libraries.

       --ldflags
           Print the value of the LDFLAGS variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows linker switches.

       --ldflags_ex
           Print the value of the LDFLAGS_EX variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows linker switches used for building
           executables only.

       --ldflags_sl
           Print the value of the LDFLAGS_SL variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This shows linker switches used for building shared
           libraries only.

       --libs
           Print the value of the LIBS variable that was used for building PostgreSQL. This normally contains -l switches for external libraries
           linked into PostgreSQL.

       --version
           Print the version of PostgreSQL.

       -?
       --help
           Show help about pg_config command line arguments, and exit.
       If more than one option is given, the information is printed in that order, one item per line. If no options are given, all available
       information is printed, with labels.

NOTES
       The options --docdir, --pkgincludedir, --localedir, --mandir, --sharedir, --sysconfdir, --cc, --cppflags, --cflags, --cflags_sl, --ldflags,
       --ldflags_sl, and --libs were added in PostgreSQL 8.1. The option --htmldir was added in PostgreSQL 8.4. The option --ldflags_ex was added
       in PostgreSQL 9.0.

EXAMPLE
       To reproduce the build configuration of the current PostgreSQL installation, run the following command:

           eval ./configure `pg_config --configure`

       The output of pg_config --configure contains shell quotation marks so arguments with spaces are represented correctly. Therefore, using
       eval is required for proper results.
