NAME
     lorder — list dependencies for object files

SYNOPSIS
     lorder file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The lorder utility uses nm(1) to determine interdependencies in the list of object files and library archives specified on the command line.  The lorder utility outputs a list of file names
     where the first file contains a symbol which is defined by the second file.

     The output is normally used with tsort(1) when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single pass of the
     loader.

     When linking static binaries, lorder and tsort(1) can be used to properly order library archives automatically.

ENVIRONMENT
     NM      Path to the nm(1) binary, defaults to “nm”.

     NMFLAGS
             Flags to pass to nm(1).

EXAMPLES
           ar cr library.a `lorder ${OBJS} | tsort`
           cc -o foo ${OBJS} `lorder ${STATIC_LIBS} | tsort`
