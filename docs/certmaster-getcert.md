NAME
       certmaster-getcert


SYNOPSIS
        certmaster-getcert request [options]
        certmaster-getcert resubmit [options]
        certmaster-getcert start-tracking [options]
        certmaster-getcert status [options]
        certmaster-getcert stop-tracking [options]
        certmaster-getcert list [options]
        certmaster-getcert list-cas [options]
        certmaster-getcert refresh-cas [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The  certmaster-getcert tool issues requests to a org.fedorahosted.certmonger service on behalf of the invoking user.  It can ask the service to begin enrollment, optionally generating a key pair to
       use, it can ask the service to begin monitoring a certificate in a specified location for expiration, and optionally to refresh it when expiration nears, it can list the set of certificates that the
       service is already monitoring, or it can list the set of CAs that the service is capable of using.

       If no command is given as the first command-line argument, certmaster-getcert will print short usage information for each of its functions.

       The certmaster-getcert tool behaves identically to the generic getcert tool when it is used with the -c certmaster option.

       There  is no standard authenticated method for obtaining the root certificate from certmaster CAs, so certmonger does not support retrieving trust information from them.  While the -F and -a options
       will still be recognized, they will effectively be ignored.
