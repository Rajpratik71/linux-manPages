NAME
       ikiwiki - a wiki compiler

SYNOPSIS
       ikiwiki [options] source destination

       ikiwiki --setup setupfile [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ikiwiki is a wiki compiler. It builds static HTML pages for a wiki, from source in the ikiwiki/Markdown language (or others), and writes it
       out to destination.

       Note that most options can be shortened to single letters, boolean flags such as --verbose can be negated with  --no-verbose,  and  options
       such as --verbose can also be spelled like -verbose.

MODE OPTIONS
       These options control the mode that ikiwiki operates in.

       --refresh
              Refresh  the  wiki,  updating  any  changed  pages. This is the default behavior if no other mode action is specified (but note that
              --setup is a mode action, and has different default behavior).

       --rebuild
              Force a rebuild of all pages.

       --setup setupfile
              Load options from the given setup file. If no other mode action is  specified,  generate  wrappers  and  rebuild  the  wiki,  as  if
              --rebuild --wrappers were used.  If you only want to build any changed pages, you can use --refresh with --setup.

       --changesetup setupfile
              Reads  the setup file, adds any configuration changes specified by other options, and writes the new configuration back to the setup
              file. Also updates any configured wrappers. In this mode, the wiki is not fully rebuilt, unless you also add --rebuild.

              Example, to enable some plugins:

               ikiwiki --changesetup ~/ikiwiki.setup --plugin goodstuff --plugin calendar

       --dumpsetup setupfile
              Causes ikiwiki to write to the specified setup file, dumping out its current configuration.

       --wrappers
              If used with --setup --refresh, this makes it also update any configured wrappers.

       --clean
              This makes ikiwiki clean up by removing any files it generated in the destination directory, as well as any configured wrappers, and
              the .ikiwiki state directory. This is mostly useful if you're running ikiwiki in a Makefile to build documentation and want a corre‐
              sponding clean target.

       --cgi  Enable CGI mode. In cgi mode ikiwiki runs as a cgi script, and supports editing pages, signing in, and registration.

              To use ikiwiki as a CGI program you need to use --wrapper or --setup to generate a wrapper. The wrapper will generally need  to  run
              suid 6755 to the user who owns the source and destination directories.

       --wrapper [file]
              Generate  a wrapper binary that is hardcoded to do action specified by the other options, using the specified input files and desti‐
              nation directory. The filename to use for the wrapper is optional.

              The wrapper is designed to be safely made suid and be run by untrusted users, as a post-commit hook, or as a CGI.

              Note that the generated wrapper will ignore all command line parameters.

       --aggregate
              If the plugins/aggregate plugin is enabled, this makes ikiwiki poll configured feeds and save new posts to the srcdir.

              Note that to rebuild previously aggregated posts, use the --rebuild option along with this one. --rebuild will also force  feeds  to
              be polled even if they were polled recently.

       --render file
              Renders  a  single file, outputting the resulting html. Does not save state, so this cannot be used for building whole wikis, but it
              is useful for previewing an edited file at the command line. Generally used in conjunction with --setup to load in a wiki's setup:

               ikiwiki --setup ~/ikiwiki.setup --render foo.mdwn

       --post-commit
              Run in post-commit mode, the same as if called by a post-commit hook.  This is probably only useful when using ikiwiki  with  a  web
              server  on  one  host and a repository on another, to allow the repository's real post-commit hook to ssh to the web server host and
              manually run ikiwiki to update the web site.

       --version
              Print ikiwiki's version number.

CONFIG OPTIONS
       These options configure the wiki. Note that plugins can add additional configuration options of their own. All of these  options  and  more
       besides can also be configured using a setup file.

       --wikiname name
              The name of the wiki, default is "wiki".

       --templatedir dir
              Specify  the  directory that templates are stored in.  Default is /usr/share/ikiwiki/templates, or another location as configured at
              build time. If the templatedir is changed, missing templates will still be searched for in the default location as a fallback.  Tem‐
              plates can also be placed in the "templates/" subdirectory of the srcdir.

              Note  that  if you choose to copy and modify ikiwiki's templates, you will need to be careful to keep them up to date when upgrading
              to new versions of ikiwiki. Old versions of templates do not always work with new ikiwiki versions.

       --underlaydir dir
              Specify the directory that is used to underlay the source directory.  Source files will be taken from here unless  overridden  by  a
              file in the source directory. Default is /usr/share/ikiwiki/basewiki or another location as configured at build time.

       --wrappermode mode
              Specify a mode to chmod the wrapper to after creating it.

       --wrappergroup group
              Specify  what  unix  group the wrapper should be owned by. This can be useful if the wrapper needs to be owned by a group other than
              the default.  For example, if a project has a repository with multiple committers with access controlled by a group, it makes  sense
              for the ikiwiki wrappers to run setgid to that group.

       --rcs=svn|git|.., --no-rcs
              Enable or disable use of a revision_control_system.

              The source directory will be assumed to be a working copy, or clone, or whatever the revision control system you select uses.

              In CGI mode, with a revision control system enabled, pages edited via the web will be committed.

              No revision control is enabled by default.

       --svnrepo /svn/wiki
              Specify the location of the svn repository for the wiki.

       --svnpath trunk
              Specify  the  path  inside your svn repository where the wiki is located.  This defaults to trunk; change it if your wiki is at some
              other path inside the repository. If your wiki is rooted at the top of the repository, set svnpath to "".

       --rss, --norss
              If rss is set, ikiwiki will default to generating RSS feeds for pages that inline a blog.

       --allowrss
              If allowrss is set, and rss is not set, ikiwiki will not default to generating RSS feeds, but setting rss=yes in the  inline  direc‐
              tive can override this default and generate a feed.

       --atom, --noatom
              If atom is set, ikiwiki will default to generating Atom feeds for pages that inline a blog.

       --allowatom
              If  allowatom  is  set,  and  rss  is not set, ikiwiki will not default to generating Atom feeds, but setting atom=yes in the inline
              directive can override this default and generate a feed.

       --pingurl URL
              Set this to the URL of an XML-RPC service to ping when an RSS feed is  updated.  For  example,  to  ping  Technorati,  use  the  URL
              http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping

              This parameter can be specified multiple times to specify more than one URL to ping.

       --url URL
              Specifies the URL to the wiki. This is a required parameter in CGI mode.

       --cgiurl http://example.org/ikiwiki.cgi
              Specifies the URL to the ikiwiki CGI script wrapper. Required when building the wiki for links to the cgi script to be generated.

       --historyurl URL
              Specifies  the  URL to link to for page history browsing. In the URL, "[[file]]" is replaced with the file to browse. It's common to
              use ViewVC for this.

       --adminemail you@example.org
              Specifies the email address that ikiwiki should use for sending email.

       --diffurl URL
              Specifies the URL to link to for a diff of changes to a page. In the URL, "[[file]]" is replaced with the file to  browse,  "[[r1]]"
              is the old revision of the page, and "[[r2]]" is the new revision. It's common to use ViewVC for this.

       --exclude regexp
              Specifies a rexexp of source files to exclude from processing.  May be specified multiple times to add to exclude list.

       --include regexp
              Specifies  a  rexexp of source files, that would normally be excluded, but that you wish to include in processing.  May be specified
              multiple times to add to include list.

       --adminuser name
              Specifies a username of a user (or, if openid is enabled, an openid) who has the powers of a wiki admin. Currently allows locking of
              any page, and banning users, as well as powers granted by enabled plugins (such as [[moderating comments|plugins/moderatedcomments]]
              and plugins/websetup. May be specified multiple times for multiple admins.

              For an openid user specify the full URL of the login, including "http://".

       --plugin name
              Enables the use of the specified plugin in the wiki.  Note that plugin names are case sensitive.

       --disable-plugin name
              Disables use of a plugin. For example "--disable-plugin htmlscrubber" to do away with HTML sanitization.

       --libdir directory
              Makes ikiwiki look in the specified directory first, before the regular locations when loading library files and plugins. For  exam‐
              ple, if you set libdir to "/home/you/.ikiwiki/", you can install a foo.pm plugin as "/home/you/.ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin/foo.pm".

       --discussion, --no-discussion
              Enables or disables "Discussion" links from being added to the header of every page. The links are enabled by default.

       --numbacklinks n
              Controls how many backlinks should be displayed at the bottom of a page.  Excess backlinks will be hidden in a popup. Default is 10.
              Set to 0 to disable this feature.

       --userdir subdir
              Optionally, allows links to users of the wiki to link to pages inside a subdirectory of the wiki. The default is to link to pages in
              the toplevel directory of the wiki.

       --htmlext html
              Configures the extension used for generated html files. Default is "html".

       --timeformat format
              Specify how to display the time or date. The format string is passed to the strftime(3) function.

       --verbose, --no-verbose
              Be verbose about what is being done.

       --syslog, --no-syslog
              Log to syslog(3).

       --usedirs, --no-usedirs
              Toggle creating output files named page/index.html (default) instead of page.html.

       --prefix-directives, --no-prefix-directives
              Toggle new '!'-prefixed syntax for preprocessor directives.  ikiwiki currently defaults to --prefix-directives.

       --w3mmode, --no-w3mmode
              Enable w3mmode, which allows w3m to use ikiwiki as a local CGI script, without a web server.

       --sslcookie
              Only send cookies over an SSL connection. This should prevent them being intercepted. If you enable this option then you must run at
              least the CGI portion of ikiwiki over SSL.

       --gettime, --no-gettime
              Extract creation and modification times for each new page from the the revision control's  log.  This  is  done  automatically  when
              building a wiki for the first time, so you normally do not need to use this option.

       --set var=value
              This  allows  setting  an  arbitrary  configuration  variable, the same as if it were set via a setup file. Since most commonly used
              options can be configured using command-line switches, you will rarely need to use this.

       --set-yaml var=value
              This is like --set, but it allows setting configuration variables that use complex data structures, by passing in a YAML document.

EXAMPLES
       ikiwiki --setup my.setup

              Completely (re)build the wiki using the specified setup file.

       ikiwiki --setup my.setup --refresh
              Refresh the wiki, using settings from my.setup, and avoid rebuilding any pages that have not changed. This is faster.

       ikiwiki --setup my.setup --refresh --wrappers
              Refresh the wiki, including regenerating all wrapper programs, but do not rebuild all pages. Useful if you have changed something in
              the setup file that does not need a full wiki rebuild to update all pages, but that you want to immediately take effect.

       ikiwiki --rebuild srcdir destdir
              Use srcdir as source and build HTML in destdir, without using a setup file.

       ikiwiki srcdir destdir
              Use srcdir as source to update changed pages' HTML in destdir, without using a setup file.

ENVIRONMENT
       CC

              This controls what C compiler is used to build wrappers. Default is 'cc'.

       CFLAGS This can be used to pass options to the C compiler when building wrappers.
