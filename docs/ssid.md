NAME
       ssid - simple setsid

SYNOPSIS
       ssid [-v] cmd [ args ]

DESCRIPTION
       ssid is an extremly simple setsid replacement.  It executes any given command after first assuming the present session identity, and possi‚Äê
       bly after forking to get a correct process group.

OPTIONS
       ssid only prints its version when fed with -v.

NOTES
       Like with all forking software, the shell interpreter might misplace a line feed when displaying output from the invoked command. This is a
       timing artefact.
