NAME
       pooltype - display a WEB pool file

SYNOPSIS
       pooltype pool_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The pooltype program translates a (program-oriented) Web string pool file to a (human-oriented) text file.

       The pool_file_name must be complete; no adding of default extensions or path searching is done.

       tangle(1).

AUTHORS
       Donald E. Knuth wrote the program and originally ported it to Unix. It was published as part of the TeXware technical report, available from the TeX Users Group.
