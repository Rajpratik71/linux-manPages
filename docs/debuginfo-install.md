NAME
       debuginfo-install - install debuginfo packages and their dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       debuginfo-install package

DESCRIPTION
       debuginfo-install is a program which installs the RPMs needed to debug the specified package.  The package argument can be a wildcard, but will only match installed packages.  debuginfo-install will
       then enable any debuginfo repositories, and install the relevant debuginfo rpm.

EXAMPLES
       Download and install all the RPMs needed to debug the kernel RPM:
              debuginfo-install kernel

WARNING MESSAGES
       Could not find debuginfo for:
              You may sometimes see warning messages about certain packages not being found if you run debuginfo-install for a wildcard or glob. Debuginfo packages are  not  necessary  for  "noarch"  RPMs;
              these will generate a warning message.  Additionally, On 64-bit systems, no multilib debuginfo packages are published, so if you have 32-bit packages installed, these will also generate warn‚Äê
              ing messages.

FILES
       As debuginfo-install uses YUM libraries for retrieving all the information, it relies on YUM configuration for its default values like which  repositories  to  use.  Consult  YUM  documentation  for
       details:

       /etc/yum.conf
       /etc/yum/repos.d/
       /var/cache/yum/
