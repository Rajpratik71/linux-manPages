NAME
       sg_ident - send SCSI REPORT/SET IDENTIFYING INFORMATION command

SYNOPSIS
       sg_ident [--ascii] [--clear] [--help] [--itype=IT] [--raw] [--set] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Send a SCSI REPORT IDENTIFYING INFORMATION or SET IDENTIFYING INFORMATION command to DEVICE. Prior to SPC-4 (revision 7) these commands were called REPORT DEVICE IDENTIFIER and SET DEVICE IDENTIFIER
       respectively. SCSI devices that support these two commands allow users to write (set) identifying information and report it back at some later time. The information is  persistent  (i.e.  stored  on
       some non-volatile medium within the SCSI device that will survive a power outage).

       Typically  the  space allocated for the information is limited: SPC-4 (revision 7) states that for information type 0, the minimum length is 64 bytes and the maximum is 512 bytes. For other informa-
       tion types (1 to 126 inclusive) the maximum length is 256 bytes. Also information types 1 to 126 (inclusive) should contain a null terminated UTF-8 string. The author has seen older disks that  only
       support 16 bytes.

       The  default  action  when no options are given is to invoke the Report Identifying Information command with the information type defaulting to zero. Error reports are sent to stderr. By default the
       information is shown in ASCII-HEX (up to 16 bytes per line) with an ASCII representation to the right with dots replacing non printable characters.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -A, --ascii
              invokes the Report Identifying Information command and if anything is found interprets it as ASCII (or UTF-8 depending on the locale) and prints the information to stdout.

       -C, --clear
              invokes the Set Identifying Information command with an information length of zero. This has the effect of clearing the existing information.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -i, --itype=IT
              where IT is the information type. Defaults to zero. The maximum value is 127 which is special and cannot be used with --set or --clear. The information type of 127 (if supported)  causes  the
              REPORT  IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION command to respond with a list of available information types and their maximum lengths in bytes. The odd numbered information types between 3 and 125 (inclu-
              sive) are not to be used (as they clash with the SCC-2 standard).

       -r, --raw
              invokes the Report Identifying information command and if anything is found sends the information (which may be binary) to stdout. Nothing else is sent to stdout  however  error  reports,  if
              any, are sent to stderr.

       -S, --set
              first  reads  stdin  until  an EOF is detected then invokes the Set Identifying Information command to set what has been fetched from stdin as the information. The amount of data read must be
              between 1 and 512 bytes length (inclusive).

       -v, --verbose
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output).

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

       This utility permits users to write their own identifying information to their SCSI devices. There are several other types of descriptors (or designators) that the user cannot change. These  include
       the  SCSI INQUIRY command with its standard vendor and product identification strings and the product revision level; plus the large amount of information provided by the "Device Identification" VPD
       page (see sg_vpd). There is also the READ MEDIA SERIAL NUMBER command (see sg_rmsn). The MMC-4 command set for CD and DVDs has a "media serial number" feature (0x109) [and  a  "logical  unit  serial
       number" feature]. These can be viewed with the sg_get_config utility.

EXAMPLES
       First, to see if there is an existing information whose format is unknown (for information type 0), use no options:

         # sg_ident /dev/sdb
          00     31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38  39 30          1234567890

       If it is ASCII then it can printed as such:

         # sg_ident --ascii /dev/sdb
         1234567890

       The information can be copied to a file, cleared and then re-asserted with this sequence:

         # sg_ident --raw /dev/sdb > t
         # sg_ident --clear /dev/sdb
         # cat t | sg_ident --set /dev/sdb

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_ident is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
