NAME
       virt-copy-in - Copy files and directories into a virtual machine disk image.

SYNOPSIS
        virt-copy-in -a disk.img file|dir [file|dir ...] /destination

        virt-copy-in -d domain file|dir [file|dir ...] /destination

WARNING
       Using "virt-copy-in" on live virtual machines, or concurrently with other disk editing tools, can be dangerous, potentially causing disk corruption.  The virtual machine must be shut down before
       you use this command, and disk images must not be edited concurrently.

DESCRIPTION
       "virt-copy-in" copies files and directories from the local disk into a virtual machine disk image or named libvirt domain.

       You can give one of more filenames and directories on the command line.  Directories are copied in recursively.  The final parameter must be the destination directory in the disk image which
       must be an absolute path starting with a / character.

EXAMPLES
       Update /etc/resolv.conf in a guest:

        virt-copy-in -d MyGuest resolv.conf /etc

       Upload a home directory to a guest:

        virt-copy-in -d MyGuest skel /home

JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH
       This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the guestfish(1) "copy-in" command.  For anything more complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish
       directly.

OPTIONS
       Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full list of options.
