NILFS-TUNE(8)                                                 System Manager's Manual                                                NILFS-TUNE(8)

NAME
       nilfs-tune - adjust tunable file system parameters on NILFS file system

SYNOPSIS
       nilfs-tune [options] device

DESCRIPTION
       nilfs-tune is a utility to modify tunable file system parameters on NILFS2 file system in device.

       This command is valid for inactive NILFS2 file systems.  Modifying active mounts may cause severe damage.

OPTIONS
       -f     Force to modify even the specified file system is mounted.

       -i interval
              Set the commit interval of segment.

       -m block-max
              Set the threshold of the data amount of the segment construction.

       -l     List the contents of the file system superblock, including the current values of the parameters that can be set via this program.

       -L volume-label
              Set the volume label of the file system.  NILFS2 file system labels can be at most 80 bytes long.  If volume-label is longer than 80
              bytes, nilfs-tune will truncate it.  The volume label can be used mount(8) and /etc/fstab(5) (and  possibly  others)  by  specifying
              LABEL=volume-label instead of a block special device name like /dev/sda5.

       -O [^]feature[,...]
              Set  or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in the filesystem.  More than one filesystem feature can be cleared or set
              by separating features with commas.  Filesystem features prefixed with a caret character ('^') will be cleared in  the  filesystem's
              superblock; filesystem features without a prefix character will be added to the filesystem.

              The following filesystem feature can be set or cleared using nilfs-tune:

              block_count
                     Enable block count per checkpoint.  After setting this option, fsck should be run on the filesystem to make the counts right,
                     but no fsck tool is available yet, sorry.

       -U UUID
              Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the file system to UUID.  The format of the UUID is a series of hex digits separated
              by hyphens, like this: "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".

       -h     Display help message and exit.
