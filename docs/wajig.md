DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the wajig command.

       wajig  packages  into one tool many commands useful for managing a Debian system. Instead of having to remember whether to use dpkg or apt-
       get or apt-cache, etc, wajig does the selection of the appropriate tool for you.

       wajig is a user command but will use sudo to run commands requiring super user permissions.

       The primary documentation is available from http://www.togaware.com/wajig.
