NAME
       pon, poff, plog - starts up, shuts down or lists the log of PPP connections

SYNOPSIS
       pon [ isp-name [ options ] ]
       poff [ -r ] [ -d ] [ -c ] [ -a ] [ -h ] [ isp-name ]
       plog [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the pon, plog and poff scripts, which allow users to control PPP connections.

   pon
       pon,  invoked  without  arguments,  runs  the  /etc/ppp/ppp_on_boot  file,  if  it  exists  and  is  executable.  Otherwise,  a  PPP  connection  will  be  started  using  configuration  from
       /etc/ppp/peers/provider.  This is the default behaviour unless an isp-name argument is given.

       For instance, to use ISP configuration "myisp" run:

              pon myisp

       pon will then use the options file /etc/ppp/peers/myisp.  You can pass additional pppd options after the ISP name, too.  pon can be used to run multiple, simultaneous PPP connections.

       pon takes the following command line options:

              -q --quick
                     disconnect when ip-up finishes running.  This function is only available to the root user.

   poff
       poff closes a PPP connection. If more than one PPP connection exists, the one named in the argument to poff will be killed, e.g.

              poff myprovider2

       will terminate the connection to myprovider2, and leave the PPP connections to e.g. "myprovider1" or "myprovider3" up and running.

       poff takes the following command line options:

              -r     causes the connection to be redialed after it is dropped.

              -d     toggles the state of pppd's debug option.

              -c     causes pppd(8) to renegotiate compression.

              -a     stops all running ppp connections. If the argument isp-name is given it will be ignored.

              -h     displays help information.

              -v     prints the version and exits.

              If no argument is given, poff will stop or signal pppd if and only if there is exactly one running. If more than one connection is active, it will exit with an error code of 1.

   plog
       plog shows you the last few lines of /var/log/ppp.log. If that file doesn't exist, it shows you the last few lines of your /var/log/syslog file, but excluding the lines not generated by pppd.
       This script makes use of the tail(1) command, so arguments that can be passed to tail(1) can also be passed to plog.

       Note:  the plog script can only be used by root or another system administrator in group "adm", due to security reasons. Also, to have all pppd-generated information in one logfile, that plog
       can show, you need the following line in your /etc/syslog.conf file:

       local2.*       -/var/log/ppp.log

FILES
       /etc/ppp/options
              PPPd system options file.

       /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
              System PAP passwords file.

       /etc/ppp/chap-secrets
              System CHAP passwords file.

       /etc/ppp/peers/
              Directory holding the peer options files. The default file is called provider.

       /etc/chatscripts/provider
              The chat script invoked from the default /etc/ppp/peers/provider.

       /var/log/ppp.log
              The default PPP log file.
