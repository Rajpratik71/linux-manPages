NAME
       ipa-cacert-manage - Manage CA certificates in IPA

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-cacert-manage [OPTIONS...] renew
ipa-cacert-manage [OPTIONS...] install CERTFILE...
ipa-cacert-manage [OPTIONS...] list

DESCRIPTION
       ipa-cacert-manage can be used to manage CA certificates in IPA.

COMMANDS
       renew  - Renew the IPA CA certificate

              This command can be used to manually renew the CA certificate of the IPA CA (NSS database nickname: "caSigningCert cert-pki-ca"). To renew other certificates, use getcert-resubmit(1).

              When  the IPA CA is the root CA (the default), it is not usually necessary to manually renew the CA certificate, as it will be renewed automatically when it is about to expire, but you can do
              so if you wish.

              When the IPA CA is subordinate of an external CA, the renewal process involves submitting a CSR to the external CA and installing the newly issued certificate in IPA,  which  cannot  be  done
              automatically. It is necessary to manually renew the CA certificate in this setup.

              When the IPA CA is not configured, this command is not available.

       install
              - Install one or more CA certificates

              This command can be used to install the certificates contained in CERTFILE as additional CA certificates to IPA.

              Important:  this  does not replace IPA CA but adds the provided certificate as a known CA. This is useful for instance when using ipa-server-certinstall to replace HTTP/LDAP certificates with
              third-party certificates signed by this additional CA.

              Please do not forget to run ipa-certupdate on the master, all the replicas and all the clients after this command in order to update IPA certificates databases.

              The supported formats for the certificate files are DER, PEM and PKCS#7 format.
       list - List the stored CA certificates

              Display a list of the nicknames or subjects of the CA certificates that have been installed.

COMMON OPTIONS
       --version
              Show the program's version and exit.

       -h, --help
              Show the help for this program.

       -p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD
              The Directory Manager password to use for authentication.

       -v, --verbose
              Print debugging information.

       -q, --quiet
              Output only errors.

       --log-file=FILE
              Log to the given file.

RENEW OPTIONS
       --self-signed
              Sign the renewed certificate by itself.

       --external-ca
              Sign the renewed certificate by external CA.

       --external-ca-type=TYPE
              Type of the external CA. Possible values are "generic", "ms-cs". Default value is "generic". Use "ms-cs" to include the template name required by Microsoft Certificate Services (MS CS) in the
              generated CSR (see --external-ca-profile for full details).


       --external-ca-profile=PROFILE_SPEC
              Specify the certificate profile or template to use at the external CA.

              When --external-ca-type is "ms-cs" the following specifiers may be used:


              <oid>:<majorVersion>[:<minorVersion>]
                     Specify a certificate template by OID and major version, optionally also specifying minor version.

              <name> Specify a certificate template by name.  The name cannot contain any : characters and cannot be an OID (otherwise the OID-based template specifier syntax takes precedence).

              default
                     If no template is specified, the template name "SubCA" is used.


       --external-cert-file=FILE
              File  containing  the  IPA  CA certificate and the external CA certificate chain. The file is accepted in PEM and DER certificate and PKCS#7 certificate chain formats. This option may be used
              multiple times.

INSTALL OPTIONS
       -n NICKNAME, --nickname=NICKNAME
              Nickname for the certificate. Applicable only when a single certificate is being installed.

       -t TRUST_FLAGS, --trust-flags=TRUST_FLAGS
              Trust flags for the certificate in certutil format. Trust flags are of the form "A,B,C" or "A,B,C,D" where A is for SSL, B is for S/MIME, C is for code signing, and D is for PKINIT. Use  ",,"
              for no explicit trust.

              The supported trust flags are:

                     C - CA trusted to issue server certificates

                     T - CA trusted to issue client certificates

                     p - not trusted

EXIT STATUS
       0 if the command was successful

       1 if an error occurred
