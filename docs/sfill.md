NAME
       sfill - secure free disk and inode space wiper (secure_deletion toolkit)

SYNOPSIS
       sfill [-f] [-i] [-I] [-l] [-l] [-v] [-z] directory/mountpoint

DESCRIPTION
       sfill is designed to delete data which lies on available diskspace on mediums in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thieves, law
       enforcement or other threats.  The wipe algorithm is based on the paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" pre‐
       sented at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The secure data deletion process of sfill goes like this:

       *      1 pass with 0xff

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       *      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       afterwards  as  many  temporary files as possible are generated to wipe the free inode space. After no more temporary files can be created,
       they are removed and sfill is finished.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -f     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom, no synchronize mode.

       -i     wipe only free inode space, not free disk space

       -I     wipe only free disk space, not free inode space

       -l     lessens the security. Only two passes are written: one mode with 0xff and a final mode with random values.

       -l     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one random pass is written.

       -v     verbose mode

       -z     wipes the last write with zeros instead of random data

       directory/mountpoint this is the location of the file created in your filesystem. It should lie on the partition you want to write.

LIMITATIONS
       FILESYSTEM INTELLIGENCE
              Most filesystems (ext2, ffs, etc.) have several features included to enhance performance, which will result in that sfill might  not
              receive all available free space. Sad but true. Nothing can be done about that ...

       NFS    Beware of NFS. You can't ensure you really completely wiped your data from the remote disks. (especially because of caching)

       Raid   Raid Systems use stripped disks and have got large caches. It's hard to wipe them.

       swap   Some of your data might have a copy in your swapspace.  sswap is available for this task.

BUGS
       No  bugs.  There  was  never  a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew, good luck ;-) Send me any that you
       find.  Patches are nice too :)
