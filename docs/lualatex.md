NAME
       latex, pdflatex, xelatex, lualatex, dvilualatex, cslatex, pdfcslatex, platex, uplatex, lamed - structured text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       latex [first-line]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page is a mere skeleton.

       The  LaTeX  language is described in the book LaTeX - A Document Preparation System.  LaTeX is a TeX macro package, not a modification to the TeX source program, so all the capa‚Äê
       bilities described in tex(1) are present.

       The LaTeX macros encourage writers to think about the content of their documents, rather than the form.  The ideal, very difficult to realize, is to have no  formatting  commands
       (like ``switch to italic'' or ``skip 2 picas'') in the document at all; instead, everything is done by specific markup instructions: ``emphasize'', ``start a section''.

       The primary source of documentation for LaTeX is the LaTeX manual referenced below.

       lualatex, pdflatex, pdfcslatex, platex, uplatex, xelatex are LaTeX formats based on the respective engines.  All output PDF by default.
       lamed is the Aleph-based LaTeX format (DVI output).
       dvilualatex is LuaTeX-based and outputs DVI.
       cslatex is csTeX-based (primitives integrated into pdfTeX) and outputs DVI.

       On some systems latex209 and slitex may still be available for compatibility with older versions of LaTeX.  These should not be used for new texts.
