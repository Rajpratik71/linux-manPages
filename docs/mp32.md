NAME
       mp64 - high-performance word generator with a per-position configurable charset

SYNOPSIS
       mp64 [options]... mask

DESCRIPTION
       Maskprocessor  is  a  fast  word list generator. It enumerates all combinations from a given user-defined keyspace and outputs the results.
       Since it supports different alphabets (which also can be combined) at  different  positions  in  the  generation  template  ('mask'),  this
       approach  allows a more fine-tunable generation of candidates than using 'naive' brute force enumeration of words.  Masks are defined using
       the description also used in the Hashcat password recovery utility.

       High-Performance word generator with a per-position configureable charset

       * Startup:

       -V,  --version
              Print version

       -h,  --help
              Print help

       * Increment:

       -i,  --increment=NUM:NUM
              Enable increment mode. 1st NUM=start, 2nd NUM=stop Example: -i 4:8 searches lengths 4-8 (inclusive)

       * Misc:

       --combinations
              Calculate number of combinations

       --hex-charset
              Assume charset is given in hex

       -q,  --seq-max=NUM
              Maximum number of multiple sequential characters

       -r,  --occurrence-max=NUM
              Maximum number of occurrence of a character

       * Resources:

       -s,  --start-at=WORD
              Start at specific position

       -l,  --stop-at=WORD
              Stop at specific position

       * Files:

       -o,  --output-file=FILE
              Output-file

       * Custom charsets:

       -1,  --custom-charset1=CS
              User-defineable charsets

       -2,  --custom-charset2=CS
              Example:

       -3,  --custom-charset3=CS  --custom-charset1=?dabcdef

       -4,  --custom-charset4=CS
              sets charset ?1 to 0123456789abcdef

       * Built-in charsets:

              ?l = abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ?u = ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ?d = 0123456789 ?s =  !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ ?a = ?l?u?d?s
              ?b = 0x00 - 0xff

MASKS
       For each position of the generated password candidates we need to configure a placeholder. If a password we want to crack has the length 8,
       our mask must consist of 8 placeholders.  A mask is a simple string that configures the keyspace of the  password  candidate  engine  using
       placeholders.  A  placeholder  can be either a custom charset variable, a built-in charset variable or a static letter. A variable is indi‚Äê
       cated by the ? letter followed by one of the built-in charset (l, u, d, s, a) or one of the custom charset variable names (1, 2, 3,  4).  A
       static letter is not indicated by a letter. An exception is if we want the static letter ? itself, which must be written as ??.

BUILTIN CHARSETS
       ?l  =  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,  ?u  =  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,  ?d  = 0123456789, ?s = (space)!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~, ?a =
       ?l?u?d?s, ?b = 0x00-0xff

CUSTOM CHARSETS
       There are four  command  line  parameters  to  configure  four  custom  charsets:  --custom-charset1=CS,  --custom-charset2=CS,   --custom-
       charset3=CS, --custom-charset4=CS.

       These  command  line  parameters  have four analogous shortcuts called -1, -2, -3 and -4. You can specify the chars directly on the command
       line.

PASSWORD LENGTH INCREMENT
       A Mask attack is always specific to a password length. For example, if we use the mask ????l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l??? we can only crack a  password
       of the length 8. But if the password we try to crack has the length 7 we will not find it. That is why we have to repeat the attack several
       times, each time with one placeholder added to the mask. This is transparently automated by using the '--increment' flag.

       ?l -> ?l?l -> ?l?l?l -> ?l?l?l?l -> ?l?l?l?l?l -> ?l?l?l?l?l?l -> ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l -> ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l
