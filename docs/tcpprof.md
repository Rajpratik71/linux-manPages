NAME
     tcpprof — report profile of network traffic

SYNOPSIS
     tcpprof [-?hdnpR] [-f filter expr] [-i interface] [-P port] [-r filename] [-s seconds] [-S letters] [-t lines]

DESCRIPTION
     tcpprof reports a profile of network traffic by ranking it by link type, ip protocol, TCP/UDP port, ip address, or network address.

     Network information is collected either by reading data from filename, or by directly monitoring the network interface interface.  The
     default action for tcpprof is to automatically search for an appropriate interface, and to generate a profile before it exits.

     When reading data from filename, tcpprof will display the profile and exit immediately after the entire file has been processed.  When col‐
     lecting data from interface, tcpprof will keep running unless the -s option had been specified.

OPTIONS
     The options are as follows:

     -f filter expr
                 Filter the packets according the rules given by filter expr.  For the syntax of these rules, see tcpdump(1).  The argument must
                 be quoted if it contains spaces in order to separate it from other options.

     -h, -?      Display version and a brief help message.

     -d          tcpprof will track the source and destination information separately, where applicable, and identify source data with a ">" and
                 destination data with "<".  For example, a "http <" statistic signifies all traffic with destination port 80 (http). This option
                 only applies to port, host and network statistics.

     -i interface
                 Do a live capture (rather than read from a file) on the interface interface given on the command line.  If interface is "auto"
                 then tcpprof tries to find an appropriate one by itself.

     -P port     This tells tcpprof to ignore TCP and UDP ports greater than or equal to port when displaying port statistics.  This is not the
                 same as filtering these port numbers out of the data set.  This way, packets with i.e. the source port above port and the desti‐
                 nation port below port will be able to still count the lower port number as a statistic.  In addition, this doesn't affect the
                 other statistic types (link, protocol, etc.)

     -p          Set the interface into non-promiscuous mode (promiscuous is the default) when doing live captures.

     -r filename
                 Read all data from filename, which may be a regular file, a named pipe or "-" to read it's data from standard input. Acceptable
                 file formats include pcap (tcpdump(1) files) and "snoop" format files.  filename is usually a file created by the tcpdump(1) com‐
                 mand using the "-w" option.

     -S letters  Tells tcpprof which statistics to display.  letters must be a string of one or more of the following letters:

                 l     show stats about the link layer

                 i     show stats about all ip protocols

                 p     show stats about TCP/UDP ports

                 h     show stats about hosts/ip addresses

                 n     show stats about network addresses

                 a     a synonym for "liphn"

     -s seconds  When monitoring an interface, tcpprof runs for only seconds seconds, and then quits.  Has no effect when reading data from a
                 file.

     -t lines    When printing a profile of the data, tcpprof will display a maximum of lines lines for each statistic.

SIGNALS
     Upon receiving a SIGINT, tcpprof will print any remaining statistics, and then exit.

FILES
     /dev/bpfn    the packet filter device

EXAMPLES
           tcpprof -i fxp0 -S a

     Displays a complete profile of network data passing through the fxp0 network interface, after the user enters ^C (control C).

           tcpprof -r file.dump -S a

     Displays a complete profile of network data from the tcpdump(1) generated file "file.dump".

HISTORY
     tcpprof was first written along side tcpstat in Winter 1998 using FreeBSD 3.0, and then finally retrofitted for Linux in Spring 2000.  It
     became installed along with tcpstat since version 1.5.

BUGS
     Not tested with link types other than Ethernet, PPP, and "None" types.

     There may be problems reading non-IPv4 packets across platforms when reading null type link layers.  This is due to a lack of a standardized
     packet type descriptor in libpcap for this link type.

     Snoop file formats cannot be read from stdin or named pipes.
