NAME
       iptraf - Interactive Colorful IP LAN Monitor

SYNOPSIS
       iptraf { [ -f ] [ -q ] [ -u ] [ { -i iface | -g | -d iface | -s iface | -z iface | -l iface } [ -t timeout ] [ -B [ -L logfile ] ] ] | [ -h
       ] }

DESCRIPTION
       iptraf is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor that generates various network statistics including TCP info, UDP counts, ICMP and OSPF  informa‚Äê
       tion, Ethernet load info, node stats, IP checksum errors, and others.

       If  the  iptraf  command  is issued without any command-line options, the program comes up in interactive mode, with the various facilities
       accessed through the main menu.

OPTIONS
       These options can also be supplied to the command:

       -i iface
              immediately start the IP traffic monitor on the specified interface, or all interfaces if "-i all" is specified

       -g     immediately start the general interface statistics

       -d iface
              allows you to immediately start the detailed on the indicated interface (iface)

       -s iface
              allows you to immediately monitor TCP and UDP traffic on the specified interface (iface)

       -z iface
              shows packet counts by size on the specified interface

       -l iface
              start the LAN station monitor on the specified interface, or all LAN interfaces if "-l all" is specified

       -t timeout
              tells IPTraf to run the specified facility for only timeout minutes.  This option is used only with one of the above parameters.

       -B     redirect standard output to /dev/null, closes standard input, and forks the program into the background.  Can be used only with  one
              of the facility invocation parameters above.  Send the backgrounded process a USR2 signal to terminate.

       -L logfile
              allows  you  to  specify  an alternate log file name.  The default log file name is based on either the interface selected (detailed
              interface statistics, TCP/UDP service statistics, packet size breakdown), or the instance of the facility (IP traffic  monitor,  LAN
              station monitor).  If a path is not specified, the log file is placed in /var/log/iptraf

       -f     clears  all  locks  and  counters, causing this instance of IPTraf to think it's the first one running.  This should only be used to
              recover from an abnormal termination or system crash.

       -u     allow use of unsupported interfaces as ethernet devices.  This is needed if you changed the name of an interface (ex:  ip  link  set
              eth0 name foo0)

       -q     no longer needed, maintained only for compatibility.

       -h     shows a command summary

SIGNALS
        SIGUSR1 - rotates log files while program is running
        SIGUSR2 - terminates an IPTraf process running in the background.

FILES
        /var/log/iptraf/*.log - log file
        /var/lib/iptraf/* - important IPTraf data files
