NAME
       bladeRF-install-firmware - BladeRF Firmware Utility

SYNOPSIS
       bladeRF-install-firmware [-h] [show help] [-i imagedir] [image_directory] [-f fpgaimage] [fpkg_image_file] [-u usbimage] [fx3_image_file]

OPTIONS
       This  program  works best without any arguments. If you already have the firmware tarball and are wanting to install it on a system without
       Internet access, then you can run this script with that file as an argument.

DESCRIPTION
       The FPGA image is built using non-free software and is not distributed by Debian. This program makes it easier for the end user to get rec‚Äê
       ommended images from Nuand.com.

       The bladeRF-cli application is used to load the FX3 firmware and the FPGA firmware.

       The  FX3  firmware only needs to be loaded once: it is stored in flash, and survives power cycling. The FPGA image needs to be loaded every
       time.

       Recommended firmware and FPGA images to use: FX3 Image: http://nuand.com/fx3/latest.img FPGA: http://nuand.com/fpga
