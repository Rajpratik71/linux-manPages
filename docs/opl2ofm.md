AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The first PLtoTF program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of 1978.  Contributions by Frank Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the
              evolution of the present code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E. Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions to handle extended font metric files (``OFM'') were added by John Plaice in December 1995 and January 1996, resulting in the new program OPL2OFM.
