NAME
       openvpn - secure IP tunnel daemon.

SYNOPSIS
       openvpn [ options ... ]

INTRODUCTION
       OpenVPN  is  an open source VPN daemon by James Yonan.  Because OpenVPN tries to be a universal
       VPN tool offering a great deal of flexibility, there are a lot of options on this manual  page.
       If  you're  new to OpenVPN, you might want to skip ahead to the examples section where you will
       see how to construct simple VPNs on the command line without even needing a configuration file.

       Also note that there's more documentation and examples on the OpenVPN  web  site:  http://open‐
       vpn.net/

       And  if  you  would like to see a shorter version of this manual, see the openvpn usage message
       which can be obtained by running openvpn without any parameters.

DESCRIPTION
       OpenVPN is a robust and highly flexible VPN daemon.  OpenVPN supports SSL/TLS security,  ether‐
       net  bridging,  TCP  or UDP tunnel transport through proxies or NAT, support for dynamic IP ad‐
       dresses and DHCP, scalability to hundreds or thousands of users, and portability to most  major
       OS platforms.

       OpenVPN  is  tightly  bound to the OpenSSL library, and derives much of its crypto capabilities
       from it.

       OpenVPN supports conventional encryption using a pre-shared secret key  (Static  Key  mode)  or
       public  key  security (SSL/TLS mode) using client & server certificates.  OpenVPN also supports
       non-encrypted TCP/UDP tunnels.

       OpenVPN is designed to work with the TUN/TAP virtual networking interface that exists  on  most
       platforms.

       Overall,  OpenVPN  aims to offer many of the key features of IPSec but with a relatively light‐
       weight footprint.

OPTIONS
       OpenVPN allows any option to be placed either on the command line or in a  configuration  file.
       Though  all  command line options are preceded by a double-leading-dash ("--"), this prefix can
       be removed when an option is placed in a configuration file.

       --help Show options.

       --config file
              Load additional config options from file where each line corresponds to one command line
              option, but with the leading '--' removed.

              If --config file is the only option to the openvpn command, the --config can be removed,
              and the command can be given as openvpn file

              Note that configuration files can be nested to a reasonable depth.

              Double quotation or single quotation characters ("", '') can be used to  enclose  single
              parameters  containing  whitespace, and "#" or ";" characters in the first column can be
              used to denote comments.

              Note that OpenVPN 2.0 and higher performs backslash-based shell escaping for  characters
              not in single quotations, so the following mappings should be observed:

                  \\       Maps to a single backslash character (\).
                  \"       Pass a literal doublequote character ("), don't
                           interpret it as enclosing a parameter.
                  \[SPACE] Pass a literal space or tab character, don't
                           interpret it as a parameter delimiter.

              For example on Windows, use double backslashes to represent pathnames:

                  secret "c:\\OpenVPN\\secret.key"

              For examples of configuration files, see http://openvpn.net/examples.html

              Here is an example configuration file:

                  #
                  # Sample OpenVPN configuration file for
                  # using a pre-shared static key.
                  #
                  # '#' or ';' may be used to delimit comments.

                  # Use a dynamic tun device.
                  dev tun

                  # Our remote peer
                  remote mypeer.mydomain

                  # 10.1.0.1 is our local VPN endpoint
                  # 10.1.0.2 is our remote VPN endpoint
                  ifconfig 10.1.0.1 10.1.0.2

                  # Our pre-shared static key
                  secret static.key

   Tunnel Options:
       --mode m
              Set OpenVPN major mode.  By default, OpenVPN runs in point-to-point mode ("p2p").  Open‐
              VPN 2.0 introduces a new mode ("server") which implements a multi-client server capabil‐
              ity.

       --local host
              Local host name or IP address for bind.  If specified, OpenVPN will bind to this address
              only.  If unspecified, OpenVPN will bind to all interfaces.

       --remote host [port] [proto]
              Remote host name or IP address.  On the client, multiple --remote options may be  speci‐
              fied  for redundancy, each referring to a different OpenVPN server.  Specifying multiple
              --remote options for this purpose is a special case of the more general  connection-pro‐
              file feature.  See the <connection> documentation below.

              The  OpenVPN  client will try to connect to a server at host:port in the order specified
              by the list of --remote options.

              proto indicates the protocol to use when connecting with the remote, and may be "tcp" or
              "udp".

              For forcing IPv4 or IPv6 connection suffix tcp or udp with 4/6 like udp4/udp6/tcp4/tcp6.

              The  client  will move on to the next host in the list, in the event of connection fail‐
              ure.  Note that at any given time, the OpenVPN client will at most be connected  to  one
              server.

              Note  that  since UDP is connectionless, connection failure is defined by the --ping and
              --ping-restart options.

              Note the following corner case:  If you use multiple --remote options, AND you are drop‐
              ping root privileges on the client with --user and/or --group, AND the client is running
              a non-Windows OS, if the client needs to switch to a different server, and  that  server
              pushes back different TUN/TAP or route settings, the client may lack the necessary priv‐
              ileges to close and reopen the TUN/TAP interface.  This could cause the client  to  exit
              with a fatal error.

              If  --remote  is  unspecified,  OpenVPN will listen for packets from any IP address, but
              will not act on those packets unless they pass all authentication tests.  This  require‐
              ment  for  authentication  is  binding on all potential peers, even those from known and
              supposedly trusted IP addresses (it is very easy to forge a source IP address on  a  UDP
              packet).

              When  used  in  TCP  mode, --remote will act as a filter, rejecting connections from any
              host which does not match host.

              If host is a DNS name which resolves to multiple IP addresses, OpenVPN will try them  in
              the  order  that the system getaddrinfo() presents them, so priorization and DNS random‐
              ization is done by the system library.  Unless an IP version is forced by  the  protocol
              specification  (4/6 suffix), OpenVPN will try both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in the order
              getaddrinfo() returns them.

       --remote-random-hostname
              Prepend a random string (6 bytes, 12 hex characters) to hostname to prevent DNS caching.
              For example, "foo.bar.gov" would be modified to "<random-chars>.foo.bar.gov".

       <connection>
              Define  a  client  connection profile.  Client connection profiles are groups of OpenVPN
              options that describe how to connect to a given OpenVPN server.  Client connection  pro‐
              files  are specified within an OpenVPN configuration file, and each profile is bracketed
              by <connection> and </connection>.

              An OpenVPN client will try each connection profile sequentially until it achieves a suc‐
              cessful connection.

              --remote-random can be used to initially "scramble" the connection list.

              Here is an example of connection profile usage:

                  client
                  dev tun

                  <connection>
                  remote 198.19.34.56 1194 udp
                  </connection>

                  <connection>
                  remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
                  </connection>

                  <connection>
                  remote 198.19.34.56 443 tcp
                  http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
                  </connection>

                  <connection>
                  remote 198.19.36.99 443 tcp
                  http-proxy 192.168.0.8 8080
                  </connection>

                  persist-key
                  persist-tun
                  pkcs12 client.p12
                  remote-cert-tls server
                  verb 3

              First  we  try to connect to a server at 198.19.34.56:1194 using UDP.  If that fails, we
              then try to connect to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP.  If that also fails,  then  try  con‐
              necting  through  an  HTTP proxy at 192.168.0.8:8080 to 198.19.34.56:443 using TCP.  Fi‐
              nally, try to connect through the same proxy to a server at 198.19.36.99:443 using TCP.

              The following OpenVPN options may be used inside of a <connection> block:

              bind, connect-retry, connect-retry-max,  connect-timeout,  explicit-exit-notify,  float,
              fragment,  http-proxy,  http-proxy-option,  link-mtu,  local,  lport,  mssfix, mtu-disc,
              nobind, port, proto, remote, rport, socks-proxy, tun-mtu and tun-mtu-extra.

              A defaulting mechanism exists for specifying options to apply to all  <connection>  pro‐
              files.   If any of the above options (with the exception of remote ) appear outside of a
              <connection> block, but in a configuration file  which  has  one  or  more  <connection>
              blocks,  the option setting will be used as a default for <connection> blocks which fol‐
              low it in the configuration file.

              For example, suppose the nobind option were placed  in  the  sample  configuration  file
              above,  near the top of the file, before the first <connection> block.  The effect would
              be as if nobind were declared in all <connection> blocks below it.

       --proto-force p
              When iterating through connection profiles, only  consider  profiles  using  protocol  p
              ('tcp'|'udp').

       --remote-random
              When  multiple --remote address/ports are specified, or if connection profiles are being
              used, initially randomize the order of the list as a kind of basic  load-balancing  mea‐
              sure.

       --proto p
              Use  protocol  p  for  communicating  with  remote  host.   p can be udp, tcp-client, or
              tcp-server.

              The default protocol is udp when --proto is not specified.

              For UDP operation, --proto udp should be specified on both peers.

              For TCP operation, one peer must use --proto tcp-server and the other must  use  --proto
              tcp-client.   A peer started with tcp-server will wait indefinitely for an incoming con‐
              nection.  A peer started with tcp-client will attempt to connect,  and  if  that  fails,
              will sleep for 5 seconds (adjustable via the --connect-retry option) and try again infi‐
              nite or up to N retries (adjustable  via  the  --connect-retry-max  option).   Both  TCP
              client  and server will simulate a SIGUSR1 restart signal if either side resets the con‐
              nection.

              OpenVPN is designed to operate optimally over UDP, but TCP capability  is  provided  for
              situations  where UDP cannot be used.  In comparison with UDP, TCP will usually be some‐
              what less efficient and less robust when used over unreliable or congested networks.

              This article outlines some of problems with tunneling IP over TCP:

              http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html

              There are certain cases, however, where using TCP may be advantageous  from  a  security
              and robustness perspective, such as tunneling non-IP or application-level UDP protocols,
              or tunneling protocols which don't possess a built-in reliability layer.

       --connect-retry n [max]
              Wait n seconds  between connection attempts (default=5). Repeated reconnection  attempts
              are  slowed  down after 5 retries per remote by doubling the wait time after each unsuc‐
              cessful attempt. The optional argument max specifies the maximum value of wait  time  in
              seconds at which it gets capped (default=300).

       --connect-retry-max n
              n specifies the number of times each --remote or <connection> entry is tried. Specifying
              n as one would try each entry exactly once. A successful connection resets the  counter.
              (default=unlimited).

       --show-proxy-settings
              Show  sensed  HTTP or SOCKS proxy settings. Currently, only Windows clients support this
              option.

       --http-proxy server port [authfile|'auto'|'auto-nct'] [auth-method]
              Connect to remote host through an HTTP proxy at address server and port port.   If  HTTP
              Proxy-Authenticate is required, authfile is a file containing a username and password on
              2 lines, or "stdin" to prompt from console. Its content can also  be  specified  in  the
              config file with the --http-proxy-user-pass option. (See section on inline files)

              auth-method should be one of "none", "basic", or "ntlm".

              HTTP Digest authentication is supported as well, but only via the auto or auto-nct flags
              (below).

              The auto flag causes OpenVPN to automatically determine the auth-method and query  stdin
              or  the  management interface for username/password credentials, if required.  This flag
              exists on OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.

              The auto-nct flag (no clear-text auth) instructs OpenVPN to automatically determine  the
              authentication  method,  but  to reject weak authentication protocols such as HTTP Basic
              Authentication.

       --http-proxy-option type [parm]
              Set extended HTTP proxy options.  Repeat to set multiple options.

              VERSION version -- Set HTTP version number to version (default=1.0).

              AGENT user-agent -- Set HTTP "User-Agent" string to user-agent.

              CUSTOM-HEADER name content -- Adds the custom Header with name as name  and  content  as
              the content of the custom HTTP header.

       --socks-proxy server [port] [authfile]
              Connect  to  remote  host  through  a  Socks5 proxy at address server and port port (de‐
              fault=1080).  authfile (optional) is a file containing a  username  and  password  on  2
              lines, or "stdin" to prompt from console.

       --resolv-retry n
              If hostname resolve fails for --remote, retry resolve for n seconds before failing.

              Set n to "infinite" to retry indefinitely.

              By default, --resolv-retry infinite is enabled.  You can disable by setting n=0.

       --float
              Allow remote peer to change its IP address and/or port number, such as due to DHCP (this
              is the default if --remote is not used).  --float when specified with --remote allows an
              OpenVPN  session  to  initially connect to a peer at a known address, however if packets
              arrive from a new address and pass all authentication tests, the new address  will  take
              control  of the session.  This is useful when you are connecting to a peer which holds a
              dynamic address such as a dial-in user or DHCP client.

              Essentially, --float tells OpenVPN to accept authenticated packets from any address, not
              only the address which was specified in the --remote option.

       --ipchange cmd
              Run command cmd when our remote ip-address is initially authenticated or changes.

              cmd  consists  of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by argu‐
              ments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted  and/or  escaped  using  a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              When  cmd  is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in cmd ,
              as follows:

              cmd ip_address port_number

              Don't use --ipchange in --mode server mode.  Use a --client-connect script instead.

              See the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as  en‐
              vironmental variables.

              If  you are running in a dynamic IP address environment where the IP addresses of either
              peer could change without notice, you can use this script,  for  example,  to  edit  the
              /etc/hosts file with the current address of the peer.  The script will be run every time
              the remote peer changes its IP address.

              Similarly if our IP address changes due to DHCP, we  should  configure  our  IP  address
              change  script  (see  man  page for dhcpcd(8) ) to deliver a SIGHUP or SIGUSR1 signal to
              OpenVPN.  OpenVPN will then reestablish a connection with its  most  recently  authenti‐
              cated peer on its new IP address.

       --port port
              TCP/UDP  port  number  or  port  name  for  both local and remote (sets both --lport and
              --rport options to given port).  The current default of  1194  represents  the  official
              IANA  port  number  assignment  for  OpenVPN and has been used since version 2.0-beta17.
              Previous versions used port 5000 as the default.

       --lport port
              Set local TCP/UDP port number or name.  Cannot be used together with --nobind option.

       --rport port
              Set TCP/UDP port number or name used by the --remote option. The port can  also  be  set
              directly using the --remote option.

       --bind [ipv6only]
              Bind  to  local address and port. This is the default unless any of --proto tcp-client ,
              --http-proxy or --socks-proxy are used.

              If the ipv6only keyword is present OpenVPN will bind only to IPv6 (as oposed to IPv6 and
              IPv4) when a IPv6 socket is opened.

       --nobind
              Do  not  bind  to local address and port.  The IP stack will allocate a dynamic port for
              returning packets.  Since the value of the dynamic port could not be known in advance by
              a  peer,  this option is only suitable for peers which will be initiating connections by
              using the --remote option.

       --dev tunX | tapX | null
              TUN/TAP virtual network device ( X can be omitted for a dynamic device.)

              See examples section below for an example on setting up a TUN device.

              You must use either tun devices on both ends of the connection or tap  devices  on  both
              ends.  You cannot mix them, as they represent different underlying network layers.

              tun  devices encapsulate IPv4 or IPv6 (OSI Layer 3) while tap devices encapsulate Ether‐
              net 802.3 (OSI Layer 2).

       --dev-type device-type
              Which device type are we using?  device-type should be tun (OSI Layer  3)  or  tap  (OSI
              Layer  2).   Use  this  option only if the TUN/TAP device used with --dev does not begin
              with tun or tap.

       --topology mode
              Configure virtual addressing topology when running in --dev tun  mode.   This  directive
              has no meaning in --dev tap mode, which always uses a subnet topology.

              If  you  set  this  directive on the server, the --server and --server-bridge directives
              will automatically push your chosen topology setting to clients as well.  This directive
              can  also  be manually pushed to clients.  Like the --dev directive, this directive must
              always be compatible between client and server.

              mode can be one of:

              net30 -- Use a point-to-point topology, by allocating one /30 subnet per  client.   This
              is designed to allow point-to-point semantics when some or all of the connecting clients
              might be Windows systems.  This is the default on OpenVPN 2.0.

              p2p -- Use a point-to-point topology where the remote endpoint of the client's  tun  in‐
              terface  always  points  to the local endpoint of the server's tun interface.  This mode
              allocates a single IP address per connecting client.  Only use when none of the connect‐
              ing  clients  are Windows systems.  This mode is functionally equivalent to the --ifcon‐
              fig-pool-linear directive which is available in OpenVPN 2.0, is deprecated and  will  be
              removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              subnet  -- Use a subnet rather than a point-to-point topology by configuring the tun in‐
              terface with a local IP address and subnet mask, similar to the topology used  in  --dev
              tap  and ethernet bridging mode.  This mode allocates a single IP address per connecting
              client and works on Windows as well.  Only available when server and clients are OpenVPN
              2.1  or higher, or OpenVPN 2.0.x which has been manually patched with the --topology di‐
              rective code.  When used on Windows, requires version 8.2 or  higher  of  the  TAP-Win32
              driver.  When used on *nix, requires that the tun driver supports an ifconfig(8) command
              which sets a subnet instead of a remote endpoint IP address.

              This option exists in OpenVPN 2.1 or higher.

              Note: Using --topology subnet changes the interpretation of the arguments of  --ifconfig
              to mean "address netmask", no longer "local remote".

       --dev-node node
              Explicitly  set the device node rather than using /dev/net/tun, /dev/tun, /dev/tap, etc.
              If OpenVPN cannot figure out whether node is a TUN or TAP device based on the name,  you
              should also specify --dev-type tun or --dev-type tap.

              Under  Mac OS X this option can be used to specify the default tun implementation. Using
              --dev-node utun forces usage of the native Darwin tun  kernel  support.  Use  --dev-node
              utunN  to  select  a specific utun instance. To force using the tun.kext (/dev/tunX) use
              --dev-node tun.  When not specifying a --dev-node option openvpn will first try to  open
              utun, and fall back to tun.kext.

              On Windows systems, select the TAP-Win32 adapter which is named node in the Network Con‐
              nections Control Panel or  the  raw  GUID  of  the  adapter  enclosed  by  braces.   The
              --show-adapters  option  under  Windows  can  also  be  used  to enumerate all available
              TAP-Win32 adapters and will show both the network connections control panel name and the
              GUID for each TAP-Win32 adapter.

       --lladdr address
              Specify the link layer address, more commonly known as the MAC address.  Only applied to
              TAP devices.

       --iproute cmd
              Set alternate command to execute instead of default iproute2 command.  May  be  used  in
              order to execute OpenVPN in unprivileged environment.

       --ifconfig l rn
              Set TUN/TAP adapter parameters.  l is the IP address of the local VPN endpoint.  For TUN
              devices in point-to-point mode, rn is the IP address of the remote  VPN  endpoint.   For
              TAP  devices,  or  TUN devices used with --topology subnet, rn is the subnet mask of the
              virtual network segment which is being created or connected to.

              For TUN devices, which facilitate virtual point-to-point IP connections  (when  used  in
              --topology  net30  or p2p mode), the proper usage of --ifconfig is to use two private IP
              addresses which are not a member of any existing subnet which is in  use.   The  IP  ad‐
              dresses may be consecutive and should have their order reversed on the remote peer.  Af‐
              ter the VPN is established, by pinging rn, you will be pinging across the VPN.

              For TAP devices, which provide the ability to create virtual ethernet segments,  or  TUN
              devices in --topology subnet mode (which create virtual "multipoint networks"), --ifcon‐
              fig is used to set an IP address and subnet mask just as  a  physical  ethernet  adapter
              would  be  similarly  configured.  If you are attempting to connect to a remote ethernet
              bridge, the IP address and subnet should be set to values which would be  valid  on  the
              the bridged ethernet segment (note also that DHCP can be used for the same purpose).

              This  option,  while  primarily a proxy for the ifconfig(8) command, is designed to sim‐
              plify TUN/TAP tunnel configuration by providing a standard interface  to  the  different
              ifconfig implementations on different platforms.

              --ifconfig  parameters  which  are  IP  addresses  can  also  be  specified  as a DNS or
              /etc/hosts file resolvable name.

              For TAP devices, --ifconfig should not be used if the TAP interface will be  getting  an
              IP address lease from a DHCP server.

       --ifconfig-noexec
              Don't  actually  execute  ifconfig/netsh commands, instead pass --ifconfig parameters to
              scripts using environmental variables.

       --ifconfig-nowarn
              Don't output an options consistency check warning if the --ifconfig option on this  side
              of the connection doesn't match the remote side.  This is useful when you want to retain
              the overall benefits of the options consistency check (also  see  --disable-occ  option)
              while only disabling the ifconfig component of the check.

              For  example,  if  you have a configuration where the local host uses --ifconfig but the
              remote host does not, use --ifconfig-nowarn on the local host.

              This option will also silence warnings about potential address conflicts which occasion‐
              ally annoy more experienced users by triggering "false positive" warnings.

       --route network/IP [netmask] [gateway] [metric]
              Add  route  to  routing  table  after connection is established.  Multiple routes can be
              specified.  Routes will be automatically torn down in reverse order prior to TUN/TAP de‐
              vice close.

              This  option is intended as a convenience proxy for the route(8) shell command, while at
              the same time providing portable semantics across OpenVPN's platform space.

              netmask default -- 255.255.255.255

              gateway default -- taken from --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig when
              --dev tun is specified.

              metric default -- taken from --route-metric otherwise 0.

              The default can be specified by leaving an option blank or setting it to "default".

              The network and gateway parameters can also be specified as a DNS or /etc/hosts file re‐
              solvable name, or as one of three special keywords:

              vpn_gateway -- The remote VPN endpoint address (derived either from  --route-gateway  or
              the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified).

              net_gateway  --  The  pre-existing  IP default gateway, read from the routing table (not
              supported on all OSes).

              remote_host -- The --remote address if OpenVPN is being run in client mode, and is unde‐
              fined in server mode.

       --route-gateway gw|'dhcp'
              Specify a default gateway gw for use with --route.

              If dhcp is specified as the parameter, the gateway address will be extracted from a DHCP
              negotiation with the OpenVPN server-side LAN.

       --route-metric m
              Specify a default metric m for use with --route.

       --route-delay [n] [w]
              Delay n seconds (default=0) after connection establishment, before adding routes.  If  n
              is  0, routes will be added immediately upon connection establishment.  If --route-delay
              is omitted, routes will be added immediately after TUN/TAP device open and  --up  script
              execution, before any --user or --group privilege downgrade (or --chroot execution.)

              This  option is designed to be useful in scenarios where DHCP is used to set tap adapter
              addresses.  The delay will give the DHCP handshake time to complete  before  routes  are
              added.

              On Windows, --route-delay tries to be more intelligent by waiting w seconds (w=30 by de‐
              fault) for the TAP-Win32 adapter to come up before adding routes.

       --route-up cmd
              Run command cmd after routes are added, subject to --route-delay.

              cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed  by  argu‐
              ments.  The  path  and  arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              See the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as  en‐
              vironmental variables.

       --route-pre-down cmd
              Run command cmd before routes are removed upon disconnection.

              cmd  consists  of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by argu‐
              ments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted  and/or  escaped  using  a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              See  the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as en‐
              vironmental variables.

       --route-noexec
              Don't add or remove routes automatically.  Instead pass routes to --route-up script  us‐
              ing environmental variables.

       --route-nopull
              When  used  with  --client or --pull, accept options pushed by server EXCEPT for routes,
              block-outside-dns and dhcp options like DNS servers.

              When used on the client, this option effectively bars the server from adding  routes  to
              the client's routing table, however note that this option still allows the server to set
              the TCP/IP properties of the client's TUN/TAP interface.

       --allow-pull-fqdn
              Allow client to pull DNS names from server (rather than being limited to IP address) for
              --ifconfig, --route, and --route-gateway.

       --client-nat snat|dnat network netmask alias
              This  pushable client option sets up a stateless one-to-one NAT rule on packet addresses
              (not ports), and is useful in cases where routes or  ifconfig  settings  pushed  to  the
              client would create an IP numbering conflict.

              network/netmask  (for  example  192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0) defines the local view of a re‐
              source   from   the   client   perspective,    while    alias/netmask    (for    example
              10.64.0.0/255.255.0.0) defines the remote view from the server perspective.

              Use  snat  (source NAT) for resources owned by the client and dnat (destination NAT) for
              remote resources.

              Set --verb 6 for debugging info showing the  transformation  of  src/dest  addresses  in
              packets.

       --redirect-gateway flags...
              Automatically execute routing commands to cause all outgoing IP traffic to be redirected
              over the VPN.  This is a client-side option.

              This option performs three steps:

              (1) Create a static route for the --remote address which forwards  to  the  pre-existing
              default gateway.  This is done so that (3) will not create a routing loop.

              (2) Delete the default gateway route.

              (3)  Set  the  new  default  gateway to be the VPN endpoint address (derived either from
              --route-gateway or the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified).

              When the tunnel is torn down, all of the above steps are reversed so that  the  original
              default route is restored.

              Option flags:

              local  --  Add  the local flag if both OpenVPN peers are directly connected via a common
              subnet, such as with wireless.  The local flag will cause step 1 above to be omitted.

              autolocal -- Try to automatically determine whether to enable local flag above.

              def1 -- Use this flag to override the default gateway by using 0.0.0.0/1 and 128.0.0.0/1
              rather than 0.0.0.0/0.  This has the benefit of overriding but not wiping out the origi‐
              nal default gateway.

              bypass-dhcp -- Add a direct route to the DHCP server (if it is non-local) which bypasses
              the tunnel (Available on Windows clients, may not be available on non-Windows clients).

              bypass-dns  -- Add a direct route to the DNS server(s) (if they are non-local) which by‐
              passes the tunnel (Available on Windows clients, may not  be  available  on  non-Windows
              clients).

              block-local  --  Block access to local LAN when the tunnel is active, except for the LAN
              gateway itself.  This is accomplished by routing the local LAN (except for the LAN gate‐
              way address) into the tunnel.

              ipv6  --  Redirect  IPv6  routing into the tunnel.  This works similar to the def1 flag,
              that is, more specific IPv6 routes are added (2000::/4, 3000::/4),  covering  the  whole
              IPv6 unicast space.

              !ipv4  --  Do  not redirect IPv4 traffic - typically used in the flag pair ipv6 !ipv4 to
              redirect IPv6-only.

       --link-mtu n
              Sets an upper bound on the size of UDP packets which are  sent  between  OpenVPN  peers.
              It's best not to set this parameter unless you know what you're doing.

       --redirect-private [flags]
              Like  --redirect-gateway,  but  omit actually changing the default gateway.  Useful when
              pushing private subnets.

       --tun-mtu n
              Take the TUN device MTU to be n and derive the link MTU from it (default=1500).  In most
              cases, you will probably want to leave this parameter set to its default value.

              The  MTU  (Maximum Transmission Units) is the maximum datagram size in bytes that can be
              sent unfragmented over a particular network path.  OpenVPN requires that packets on  the
              control or data channels be sent unfragmented.

              MTU  problems  often manifest themselves as connections which hang during periods of ac‐
              tive usage.

              It's best to use the --fragment and/or --mssfix options to deal with MTU sizing issues.

       --tun-mtu-extra n
              Assume that the TUN/TAP device might return as many as n bytes more than  the  --tun-mtu
              size  on  read.  This parameter defaults to 0, which is sufficient for most TUN devices.
              TAP devices may introduce additional overhead in excess of the MTU size, and  a  setting
              of  32  is the default when TAP devices are used.  This parameter only controls internal
              OpenVPN buffer sizing, so there is no transmission  overhead  associated  with  using  a
              larger value.

       --mtu-disc type
              Should  we  do  Path  MTU  discovery on TCP/UDP channel?  Only supported on OSes such as
              Linux that supports the necessary system call to set.

              'no' -- Never send DF (Don't Fragment) frames
              'maybe' -- Use per-route hints
              'yes' -- Always DF (Don't Fragment)

       --mtu-test
              To empirically measure MTU on connection startup, add the --mtu-test option to your con‐
              figuration.  OpenVPN will send ping packets of various sizes to the remote peer and mea‐
              sure the largest packets which were successfully received.  The --mtu-test process  nor‐
              mally takes about 3 minutes to complete.

       --fragment max
              Enable  internal  datagram  fragmentation  so  that  no UDP datagrams are sent which are
              larger than max bytes.

              The max parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu parameter,  i.e.  the
              UDP  packet  size  after encapsulation overhead has been added in, but not including the
              UDP header itself.

              The --fragment option only makes sense when you are using the UDP protocol ( --proto udp
              ).

              --fragment adds 4 bytes of overhead per datagram.

              See the --mssfix option below for an important related option to --fragment.

              It  should  also  be noted that this option is not meant to replace UDP fragmentation at
              the IP stack level.  It is only meant as a last resort when path MTU discovery  is  bro‐
              ken.   Using  this  option  is less efficient than fixing path MTU discovery for your IP
              link and using native IP fragmentation instead.

              Having said that, there are circumstances where using OpenVPN's  internal  fragmentation
              capability  may  be your only option, such as tunneling a UDP multicast stream which re‐
              quires fragmentation.

       --mssfix max
              Announce to TCP sessions running over the tunnel  that  they  should  limit  their  send
              packet  sizes  such  that  after OpenVPN has encapsulated them, the resulting UDP packet
              size that OpenVPN sends to its peer will not exceed max  bytes.  The  default  value  is
              1450.

              The  max  parameter is interpreted in the same way as the --link-mtu parameter, i.e. the
              UDP packet size after encapsulation overhead has been added in, but  not  including  the
              UDP  header  itself.  Resulting  packet would be at most 28 bytes larger for IPv4 and 48
              bytes for IPv6 (20/40 bytes for IP header and 8 bytes for UDP header). Default value  of
              1450  allows  IPv4 packets to be transmitted over a link with MTU 1473 or higher without
              IP level fragmentation.

              The --mssfix option only makes sense when you are using the  UDP  protocol  for  OpenVPN
              peer-to-peer communication, i.e.  --proto udp.

              --mssfix  and  --fragment  can be ideally used together, where --mssfix will try to keep
              TCP from needing packet fragmentation in the  first  place,  and  if  big  packets  come
              through  anyhow  (from  protocols  other  than TCP), --fragment will internally fragment
              them.

              Both --fragment and --mssfix are designed to work around cases where Path MTU  discovery
              is broken on the network path between OpenVPN peers.

              The  usual  symptom  of  such  a  breakdown  is an OpenVPN connection which successfully
              starts, but then stalls during active usage.

              If --fragment and --mssfix are used together, --mssfix will take its default max parame‐
              ter from the --fragment max option.

              Therefore,  one  could  lower  the maximum UDP packet size to 1300 (a good first try for
              solving MTU-related connection problems) with the following options:

              --tun-mtu 1500 --fragment 1300 --mssfix

       --sndbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket send buffer size.  Defaults to operation system default.

       --rcvbuf size
              Set the TCP/UDP socket receive buffer size.  Defaults to operation system default.

       --mark value
              Mark encrypted packets being sent with value. The mark value can be  matched  in  policy
              routing  and packetfilter rules. This option is only supported in Linux and does nothing
              on other operating systems.

              Apply the given flags to the OpenVPN transport socket.  Currently, only  TCP_NODELAY  is
              supported.

              The  TCP_NODELAY socket flag is useful in TCP mode, and causes the kernel to send tunnel
              packets immediately over the TCP connection without  trying  to  group  several  smaller
              packets into a larger packet.  This can result in a considerably improvement in latency.

              This  option  is  pushable  from server to client, and should be used on both client and
              server for maximum effect.

       --txqueuelen n
              (Linux only) Set the TX queue length on the TUN/TAP interface.   Currently  defaults  to
              100.

       --shaper n
              Limit bandwidth of outgoing tunnel data to n bytes per second on the TCP/UDP port.  Note
              that this will only work if mode is set to p2p.  If you want to limit the  bandwidth  in
              both directions, use this option on both peers.

              OpenVPN  uses  the following algorithm to implement traffic shaping: Given a shaper rate
              of n bytes per second, after a datagram write of b bytes is queued on the TCP/UDP  port,
              wait a minimum of (b / n) seconds before queuing the next write.

              It  should  be  noted that OpenVPN supports multiple tunnels between the same two peers,
              allowing you to construct full-speed and reduced bandwidth tunnels  at  the  same  time,
              routing  low-priority  data  such as off-site backups over the reduced bandwidth tunnel,
              and other data over the full-speed tunnel.

              Also note that for low bandwidth tunnels (under 1000 bytes per second), you should prob‐
              ably use lower MTU values as well (see above), otherwise the packet latency will grow so
              large as to trigger timeouts in the TLS layer and TCP connections running over the  tun‐
              nel.

              OpenVPN allows n to be between 100 bytes/sec and 100 Mbytes/sec.

       --inactive n [bytes]
              Causes  OpenVPN  to  exit  after n seconds of inactivity on the TUN/TAP device. The time
              length of inactivity is measured since the last incoming or outgoing tunnel packet.  The
              default value is 0 seconds, which disables this feature.

              If  the optional bytes parameter is included, exit if less than bytes of combined in/out
              traffic are produced on the tun/tap device in n seconds.

              In any case, OpenVPN's internal ping packets (which are just keepalives) and TLS control
              packets are not considered "activity", nor are they counted as traffic, as they are used
              internally by OpenVPN and are not an indication of actual user activity.

       --ping n
              Ping remote over the TCP/UDP control channel if no packets have been sent for at least n
              seconds  (specify  --ping  on both peers to cause ping packets to be sent in both direc‐
              tions since OpenVPN ping packets are not echoed like IP ping packets).  When used in one
              of  OpenVPN's secure modes (where --secret, --tls-server, or --tls-client is specified),
              the ping packet will be cryptographically secure.

              This option has two intended uses:

              (1) Compatibility with stateful firewalls.  The periodic ping will ensure that a  state‐
              ful firewall rule which allows OpenVPN UDP packets to pass will not time out.

              (2)  To  provide  a  basis  for  the  remote to test the existence of its peer using the
              --ping-exit option.

       --ping-exit n
              Causes OpenVPN to exit after n seconds pass without reception of a ping or other  packet
              from  remote.   This  option can be combined with --inactive, --ping, and --ping-exit to
              create a two-tiered inactivity disconnect.

              For example,

              openvpn [options...] --inactive 3600 --ping 10 --ping-exit 60

              when used on both peers will cause OpenVPN to exit within 60 seconds if its peer discon‐
              nects, but will exit after one hour if no actual tunnel data is exchanged.

       --ping-restart n
              Similar  to  --ping-exit, but trigger a SIGUSR1 restart after n seconds pass without re‐
              ception of a ping or other packet from remote.

              This option is useful in cases where the remote peer has a  dynamic  IP  address  and  a
              low-TTL  DNS  name  is  used to track the IP address using a service such as http://dyn‐
              dns.org/ + a dynamic DNS client such as ddclient.

              If the peer cannot be reached, a restart will be triggered, causing  the  hostname  used
              with --remote to be re-resolved (if --resolv-retry is also specified).

              In  server  mode,  --ping-restart, --inactive, or any other type of internally generated
              signal will always be applied to individual client  instance  objects,  never  to  whole
              server  itself.   Note  also  in  server mode that any internally generated signal which
              would normally cause a restart, will cause the deletion of the  client  instance  object
              instead.

              In client mode, the --ping-restart parameter is set to 120 seconds by default.  This de‐
              fault will hold until the client pulls a replacement value from the server, based on the
              --keepalive setting in the server configuration.  To disable the 120 second default, set
              --ping-restart 0 on the client.

              See the signals section below for more information on SIGUSR1.

              Note that the behavior of SIGUSR1 can be modified by the  --persist-tun,  --persist-key,
              --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-ip options.

              Also  note that --ping-exit and --ping-restart are mutually exclusive and cannot be used
              together.

       --keepalive interval timeout
              A helper directive designed to simplify the expression of --ping and --ping-restart.

              This option can be used on both client and server side, but it is enough to add this  on
              the  server  side  as  it will push appropriate --ping and --ping-restart options to the
              client.  If used on both server and client, the values pushed from server will  override
              the client local values.

              The  timeout  argument  will  be  twice as long on the server side.  This ensures that a
              timeout is detected on client side before the server side drops the connection.

              For example, --keepalive 10 60 expands as follows:

                   if mode server:
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 120           # Argument: timeout*2
                     push "ping 10"             # Argument: interval
                     push "ping-restart 60"     # Argument: timeout
                   else
                     ping 10                    # Argument: interval
                     ping-restart 60            # Argument: timeout

       --ping-timer-rem
              Run the --ping-exit / --ping-restart timer only if we have a remote address.   Use  this
              option  if you are starting the daemon in listen mode (i.e. without an explicit --remote
              peer), and you don't want to start clocking timeouts until a remote peer connects.

       --persist-tun
              Don't close and  reopen  TUN/TAP  device  or  run  up/down  scripts  across  SIGUSR1  or
              --ping-restart restarts.

              SIGUSR1  is  a  restart signal similar to SIGHUP, but which offers finer-grained control
              over reset options.

       --persist-key
              Don't re-read key files across SIGUSR1 or --ping-restart.

              This option can be combined with --user nobody to allow restarts triggered  by  the  SI‐
              GUSR1  signal.   Normally  if  you drop root privileges in OpenVPN, the daemon cannot be
              restarted since it will now be unable to re-read protected key files.

              This option solves the problem by persisting keys across SIGUSR1 resets, so  they  don't
              need to be re-read.

       --persist-local-ip
              Preserve  initially  resolved  local  IP  address  and  port  number  across  SIGUSR1 or
              --ping-restart restarts.

       --persist-remote-ip
              Preserve most recently authenticated remote IP address and port number across SIGUSR1 or
              --ping-restart restarts.

       --mlock
              Disable  paging  by  calling the POSIX mlockall function.  Requires that OpenVPN be ini‐
              tially run as root (though OpenVPN can subsequently downgrade its UID using  the  --user
              option).

              Using  this  option  ensures that key material and tunnel data are never written to disk
              due to virtual memory paging operations which occur under most modern operating systems.
              It  ensures that even if an attacker was able to crack the box running OpenVPN, he would
              not be able to scan the system swap file to  recover  previously  used  ephemeral  keys,
              which  are  used  for a period of time governed by the --reneg options (see below), then
              are discarded.

              The downside of using --mlock is that it will  reduce  the  amount  of  physical  memory
              available to other applications.

       --up cmd
              Run command cmd after successful TUN/TAP device open (pre --user UID change).

              cmd  consists  of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by argu‐
              ments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted  and/or  escaped  using  a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              The  up  command is useful for specifying route commands which route IP traffic destined
              for private subnets which exist at the other end of the VPN connection into the tunnel.

              For --dev tun execute as:

              cmd tun_dev tun_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_remote_ip [ init | restart ]

              For --dev tap execute as:

              cmd tap_dev tap_mtu link_mtu ifconfig_local_ip ifconfig_netmask [ init | restart ]

              See the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as  en‐
              vironmental variables.

              Note that if cmd includes arguments, all OpenVPN-generated arguments will be appended to
              them to build an argument list with which the executable will be called.

              Typically, cmd will run a script to add routes to the tunnel.

              Normally the up script is called after the TUN/TAP device is opened.  In  this  context,
              the  last command line parameter passed to the script will be init.  If the --up-restart
              option is also used, the up script will be called for restarts as well.   A  restart  is
              considered  to  be  a  partial reinitialization of OpenVPN where the TUN/TAP instance is
              preserved (the --persist-tun option will enable such preservation).  A  restart  can  be
              generated  by a SIGUSR1 signal, a --ping-restart timeout, or a connection reset when the
              TCP protocol is enabled with the --proto option.  If a restart occurs, and  --up-restart
              has been specified, the up script will be called with restart as the last parameter.

              NOTE:  on  restart,  OpenVPN  will not pass the full set of environment variables to the
              script.  Namely, everything related to routing and gateways will not be passed, as noth‐
              ing  needs to be done anyway - all the routing setup is already in place.  Additionally,
              the up-restart script will run with the downgraded UID/GID settings (if configured).

              The following standalone example shows how the --up script can be called in both an ini‐
              tialization  and  restart context.  (NOTE: for security reasons, don't run the following
              example unless UDP port 9999 is blocked by your firewall.  Also, the  example  will  run
              indefinitely, so you should abort with control-c).

              openvpn  --dev  tun  --port  9999 --verb 4 --ping-restart 10 --up 'echo up' --down 'echo
              down' --persist-tun --up-restart

              Note that OpenVPN also provides the --ifconfig option to automatically ifconfig the  TUN
              device, eliminating the need to define an --up script, unless you also want to configure
              routes in the --up script.

              If --ifconfig is also specified, OpenVPN will pass the ifconfig local  and  remote  end‐
              points  on  the  command  line  to the --up script so that they can be used to configure
              routes such as:

              route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $5

       --up-delay
              Delay TUN/TAP open and possible --up script execution until after TCP/UDP connection es‐
              tablishment with peer.

              In --proto udp mode, this option normally requires the use of --ping to allow connection
              initiation to be sensed in the absence of tunnel data, since UDP is  a  "connectionless"
              protocol.

              On  Windows,  this  option  will  delay the TAP-Win32 media state transitioning to "con‐
              nected" until connection establishment, i.e. the  receipt  of  the  first  authenticated
              packet from the peer.

       --down cmd
              Run  command  cmd  after TUN/TAP device close (post --user UID change and/or --chroot ).
              cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed  by  argu‐
              ments.  The  path  and  arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              Called with the same parameters and environmental variables as the --up option above.

              Note that if you reduce privileges by using --user and/or --group,  your  --down  script
              will also run at reduced privilege.

       --down-pre
              Call --down cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close.

       --up-restart
              Enable  the --up and --down scripts to be called for restarts as well as initial program
              start.  This option is described more fully above in the --up option documentation.

       --setenv name value
              Set a custom environmental variable name=value to pass to script.

       --setenv FORWARD_COMPATIBLE 1
              Relax config file syntax checking so that unknown directives will trigger a warning  but
              not  a  fatal  error, on the assumption that a given unknown directive might be valid in
              future OpenVPN versions.

              This option should be used with caution, as there are good security reasons  for  having
              OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file.  Having said that, there are valid
              reasons for wanting new software features to  gracefully  degrade  when  encountered  by
              older software versions.

              It  is also possible to tag a single directive so as not to trigger a fatal error if the
              directive isn't recognized.  To do this, prepend the  following  before  the  directive:
              setenv opt

              Versions  prior  to OpenVPN 2.3.3 will always ignore options set with the setenv opt di‐
              rective.

              See also --ignore-unknown-option

       --setenv-safe name value
              Set a custom environmental variable OPENVPN_name=value to pass to script.

              This directive is designed to be pushed by the server to clients, and the prepending  of
              "OPENVPN_"  to the environmental variable is a safety precaution to prevent a LD_PRELOAD
              style attack from a malicious or compromised server.

       --ignore-unknown-option opt1 opt2 opt3 ... optN
              When one of options opt1 ... optN is encountered in the configuration file the  configu‐
              ration  file  parsing does not fail if this OpenVPN version does not support the option.
              Multiple --ignore-unknown-option options can be given to support a larger number of  op‐
              tions to ignore.

              This  option  should be used with caution, as there are good security reasons for having
              OpenVPN fail if it detects problems in a config file. Having said that, there are  valid
              reasons  for  wanting  new  software  features to gracefully degrade when encountered by
              older software versions.

              --ignore-unknown-option is available since OpenVPN 2.3.3.

       --script-security level
              This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external programs and
              scripts.   Lower  level  values are more restrictive, higher values are more permissive.
              Settings for level:

              0 -- Strictly no calling of external programs.
              1 -- (Default) Only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or netsh.
              2 -- Allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts.
              3 -- Allow passwords to be passed to scripts via  environmental  variables  (potentially
              unsafe).

              OpenVPN  releases  before  v2.3 also supported a method flag which indicated how OpenVPN
              should call external commands and scripts.  This could be either execve or  system.   As
              of OpenVPN 2.3, this flag is no longer accepted.  In most *nix environments the execve()
              approach has been used without any issues.

              Some directives such as --up allow options to be passed to the external script. In these
              cases  make sure the script name does not contain any spaces or the configuration parser
              will choke because it can't determine where the script  name  ends  and  script  options
              start.

              To  run  scripts  in Windows in earlier OpenVPN versions you needed to either add a full
              path to the script interpreter which can parse the script or use the system flag to  run
              these  scripts.   As  of OpenVPN 2.3 it is now a strict requirement to have full path to
              the script interpreter when running non-executables files.  This is not needed for  exe‐
              cutable  files, such as .exe, .com, .bat or .cmd files.  For example, if you have a Vis‐
              ual Basic script, you must use this syntax now:

                  --up 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe C:\\Program\ Files\\OpenVPN\\config\\my-up-script.vbs'

              Please note the single quote marks and the escaping of the backslashes (\) and the space
              character.

              The  reason  the support for the system flag was removed is due to the security implica‐
              tions with shell expansions when executing scripts via the system() call.

       --disable-occ
              Don't output a warning message if option inconsistencies are detected between peers.  An
              example  of  an  option  inconsistency  would be where one peer uses --dev tun while the
              other peer uses --dev tap.

              Use of this option is discouraged, but is provided as  a  temporary  fix  in  situations
              where a recent version of OpenVPN must connect to an old version.

       --user user
              Change  the user ID of the OpenVPN process to user after initialization, dropping privi‐
              leges in the process.  This option is useful to protect the system  in  the  event  that
              some hostile party was able to gain control of an OpenVPN session.  Though OpenVPN's se‐
              curity features make this unlikely, it is provided as a second line of defense.

              By setting user to nobody or somebody similarly unprivileged, the hostile party would be
              limited  in  what damage they could cause.  Of course once you take away privileges, you
              cannot return them to an OpenVPN session.  This means, for example, that if you want  to
              reset an OpenVPN daemon with a SIGUSR1 signal (for example in response to a DHCP reset),
              you should make use of one or more of the  --persist  options  to  ensure  that  OpenVPN
              doesn't  need to execute any privileged operations in order to restart (such as re-read‐
              ing key files or running ifconfig on the TUN device).

       --group group
              Similar to the --user option, this option changes the group ID of the OpenVPN process to
              group after initialization.

       --cd dir
              Change  directory  to  dir  prior  to reading any files such as configuration files, key
              files, scripts, etc.  dir should be an absolute path, with a leading  "/",  and  without
              any references to the current directory such as "." or "..".

              This  option  is  useful  when you are running OpenVPN in --daemon mode, and you want to
              consolidate all of your OpenVPN control files in one location.

       --chroot dir
              Chroot to dir after initialization.  --chroot essentially redefines dir as being the top
              level  directory tree (/).  OpenVPN will therefore be unable to access any files outside
              this tree.  This can be desirable from a security standpoint.

              Since the chroot operation is delayed until after initialization, most  OpenVPN  options
              that reference files will operate in a pre-chroot context.

              In  many cases, the dir parameter can point to an empty directory, however complications
              can result when scripts or restarts are executed after the chroot operation.

              Note: The SSL library will probably need /dev/urandom to be available inside the  chroot
              directory dir.  This is because SSL libraries occasionally need to collect fresh random.
              Newer linux kernels and some BSDs implement a getrandom() or getentropy()  syscall  that
              removes the need for /dev/urandom to be available.

       --setcon context
              Apply SELinux context after initialization. This essentially provides the ability to re‐
              strict OpenVPN's rights to only network I/O operations, thanks  to  SELinux.  This  goes
              further than --user and --chroot in that those two, while being great security features,
              unfortunately do not protect against privilege escalation by exploitation of a  vulnera‐
              ble  system call. You can of course combine all three, but please note that since setcon
              requires access to /proc you will have to provide it inside the chroot  directory  (e.g.
              with mount --bind).

              Since  the  setcon  operation  is delayed until after initialization, OpenVPN can be re‐
              stricted to just network-related system calls, whereas by applying  the  context  before
              startup  (such  as  the OpenVPN one provided in the SELinux Reference Policies) you will
              have to allow many things required only during initialization.

              Like with chroot, complications can result when scripts or restarts are  executed  after
              the  setcon  operation,  which is why you should really consider using the --persist-key
              and --persist-tun options.

       --daemon [progname]
              Become a daemon after all initialization functions  are  completed.   This  option  will
              cause  all message and error output to be sent to the syslog file (such as /var/log/mes‐
              sages), except for the output of  scripts  and  ifconfig  commands,  which  will  go  to
              /dev/null unless otherwise redirected.  The syslog redirection occurs immediately at the
              point that --daemon is parsed on the command line even though  the  daemonization  point
              occurs  later.   If  one of the --log options is present, it will supersede syslog redi‐
              rection.

              The optional progname parameter will cause OpenVPN to report its  program  name  to  the
              system logger as progname.  This can be useful in linking OpenVPN messages in the syslog
              file with specific tunnels.  When unspecified, progname defaults to "openvpn".

              When OpenVPN is run with the --daemon option, it will try to delay  daemonization  until
              the  majority  of  initialization functions which are capable of generating fatal errors
              are complete.  This means that initialization scripts can test the return status of  the
              openvpn  command  for  a fairly reliable indication of whether the command has correctly
              initialized and entered the packet forwarding event loop.

              In OpenVPN, the vast majority of errors which occur after initialization are non-fatal.

              Note: as soon as OpenVPN has daemonized, it can not ask for usernames, passwords, or key
              pass  phrases anymore.  This has certain consequences, namely that using a password-pro‐
              tected private key will fail unless the --askpass option is used to tell OpenVPN to  ask
              for  the pass phrase (this requirement is new in v2.3.7, and is a consequence of calling
              daemon() before initializing the crypto layer).

              Further,  using  --daemon  together  with  --auth-user-pass  (entered  on  console)  and
              --auth-nocache will fail as soon as key renegotiation (and reauthentication) occurs.

       --syslog [progname]
              Direct  log output to system logger, but do not become a daemon.  See --daemon directive
              above for description of progname parameter.

       --errors-to-stderr
              Output errors to stderr instead of stdout unless log output is redirected by one of  the
              --log options.

       --passtos
              Set the TOS field of the tunnel packet to what the payload's TOS is.

       --inetd [wait|nowait] [progname]
              Use this option when OpenVPN is being run from the inetd or xinetd(8) server.

              The  wait/nowait  option  must  match what is specified in the inetd/xinetd config file.
              The nowait mode can only be used with --proto tcp-server.  The  default  is  wait.   The
              nowait mode can be used to instantiate the OpenVPN daemon as a classic TCP server, where
              client connection requests are serviced on a single port number.  For additional  infor‐
              mation   on   this   kind   of   configuration,   see   the  OpenVPN  FAQ:  http://open‐
              vpn.net/faq.html#oneport

              This option precludes the use of --daemon, --local, or --remote.  Note that this  option
              causes  message  and  error output to be handled in the same way as the --daemon option.
              The optional progname parameter is also handled exactly as in --daemon.

              Also note that in wait mode, each OpenVPN tunnel requires a separate TCP/UDP port and  a
              separate inetd or xinetd entry.  See the OpenVPN 1.x HOWTO for an example on using Open‐
              VPN with xinetd: http://openvpn.net/1xhowto.html

       --log file
              Output logging messages to file, including output to stdout/stderr which is generated by
              called  scripts.  If file already exists it will be truncated.  This option takes effect
              immediately when it is parsed in the command line and will supersede  syslog  output  if
              --daemon or --inetd is also specified.  This option is persistent over the entire course
              of an OpenVPN instantiation and will not be reset by SIGHUP, SIGUSR1, or --ping-restart.

              Note that on Windows, when OpenVPN is started as a service, logging  occurs  by  default
              without the need to specify this option.

       --log-append file
              Append  logging messages to file.  If file does not exist, it will be created.  This op‐
              tion behaves exactly like --log except that it appends to rather than truncating the log
              file.

       --suppress-timestamps
              Avoid  writing  timestamps to log messages, even when they otherwise would be prepended.
              In particular, this applies to log messages sent to stdout.

       --machine-readable-output
              Always write timestamps and message flags to log  messages,  even  when  they  otherwise
              would not be prefixed. In particular, this applies to log messages sent to stdout.

       --writepid file
              Write OpenVPN's main process ID to file.

       --nice n
              Change  process  priority  after  initialization ( n greater than 0 is lower priority, n
              less than zero is higher priority).

       --fast-io
              (Experimental) Optimize TUN/TAP/UDP I/O writes by avoiding a call  to  poll/epoll/select
              prior to the write operation.  The purpose of such a call would normally be to block un‐
              til the device or socket is ready to accept the write.  Such blocking is unnecessary  on
              some platforms which don't support write blocking on UDP sockets or TUN/TAP devices.  In
              such cases, one can optimize the event loop by avoiding the poll/epoll/select call,  im‐
              proving CPU efficiency by 5% to 10%.

              This  option can only be used on non-Windows systems, when --proto udp is specified, and
              when --shaper is NOT specified.

       --multihome
              Configure a multi-homed UDP server.  This option needs to be used when a server has more
              than  one  IP  address (e.g. multiple interfaces, or secondary IP addresses), and is not
              using --local to force binding to one specific address only.  This option will add  some
              extra  lookups  to  the packet path to ensure that the UDP reply packets are always sent
              from the address that the client is talking to. This is not supported on all  platforms,
              and it adds more processing, so it's not enabled by default.

              Note: this option is only relevant for UDP servers.

              Note 2: if you do an IPv6+IPv4 dual-stack bind on a Linux machine with multiple IPv4 ad‐
              dress, connections to IPv4 addresses will not work right on kernels before 3.15, due  to
              missing  kernel support for the IPv4-mapped case (some distributions have ported this to
              earlier kernel versions, though).

       --echo [parms...]
              Echo parms to log output.

              Designed to be used to send messages to a controlling application which is receiving the
              OpenVPN log output.

       --remap-usr1 signal
              Control  whether  internally  or  externally  generated  SIGUSR1 signals are remapped to
              SIGHUP (restart without persisting state) or SIGTERM (exit).

              signal can be set to "SIGHUP" or "SIGTERM".  By default, no remapping occurs.

       --verb n
              Set output verbosity to n (default=1).  Each level shows all info from the previous lev‐
              els.   Level 3 is recommended if you want a good summary of what's happening without be‐
              ing swamped by output.

              0 -- No output except fatal errors.
              1 to 4 -- Normal usage range.
              5 -- Output R and W characters to the console for each packet read and write,  uppercase
              is used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for TUN/TAP packets.
              6 to 11 -- Debug info range (see errlevel.h for additional information on debug levels).

       --status file [n]
              Write operational status to file every n seconds.

              Status can also be written to the syslog by sending a SIGUSR2 signal.

              With  multi-client  capability  enabled  on a server, the status file includes a list of
              clients and a routing table. The output format can be controlled by the --status-version
              option in that case.

              For  clients  or  instances  running in point-to-point mode, it will contain the traffic
              statistics.

       --status-version [n]
              Set the status file format version number to n.

              This only affects the status file on servers with multi-client capability enabled.

              1 -- traditional format  (default).  The  client  list  contains  the  following  fields
              comma-separated: Common Name, Real Address, Bytes Received, Bytes Sent, Connected Since.
              2  --  a more reliable format for external processing. Compared to version 1, the client
              list contains some additional fields: Virtual Address, Virtual IPv6  Address,  Username,
              Client ID, Peer ID.  Future versions may extend the number of fields.
              3 -- identical to 2, but fields are tab-separated.

       --mute n
              Log at most n consecutive messages in the same category.  This is useful to limit repet‐
              itive logging of similar message types.

       --compress [algorithm]
              Enable a compression algorithm.

              The algorithm parameter may be "lzo", "lz4", or empty.  LZO and LZ4 are  different  com‐
              pression algorithms, with LZ4 generally offering the best performance with least CPU us‐
              age.  For backwards compatibility with OpenVPN versions before v2.4, use "lzo" (which is
              identical to the older option "--comp-lzo yes").

              If  the  algorithm  parameter  is  empty, compression will be turned off, but the packet
              framing for compression will still be enabled, allowing a different setting to be pushed
              later.

              Security Considerations

              Compression  and encryption is a tricky combination.  If an attacker knows or is able to
              control (parts of) the plaintext of packets that contain secrets, the attacker might  be
              able to extract the secret if compression is enabled.  See e.g. the CRIME and BREACH at‐
              tacks on TLS which also leverage compression to break encryption.  If you  are  not  en‐
              tirely  sure that the above does not apply to your traffic, you are advised to *not* en‐
              able compression.

       --comp-lzo [mode]
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in a  future  OpenVPN  release.   Use  the  newer
              --compress instead.

              Use  LZO  compression  -- may add up to 1 byte per packet for incompressible data.  mode
              may be "yes", "no", or "adaptive" (default).

              In a server mode setup, it is possible to selectively turn compression on or off for in‐
              dividual clients.

              First,  make sure the client-side config file enables selective compression by having at
              least one --comp-lzo directive, such as --comp-lzo no.  This will turn  off  compression
              by  default, but allow a future directive push from the server to dynamically change the
              on/off/adaptive setting.

              Next in a --client-config-dir file, specify the compression setting for the client,  for
              example:

                  comp-lzo yes
                  push "comp-lzo yes"

              The  first  line  sets  the comp-lzo setting for the server side of the link, the second
              sets the client side.

       --comp-noadapt
              When used in conjunction with --comp-lzo, this option will  disable  OpenVPN's  adaptive
              compression algorithm.  Normally, adaptive compression is enabled with --comp-lzo.

              Adaptive  compression tries to optimize the case where you have compression enabled, but
              you are sending predominantly incompressible (or pre-compressed) packets over  the  tun‐
              nel,  such  as an FTP or rsync transfer of a large, compressed file.  With adaptive com‐
              pression, OpenVPN will periodically sample the compression process to measure its  effi‐
              ciency.   If  the data being sent over the tunnel is already compressed, the compression
              efficiency will be very low, triggering openvpn to disable compression for a  period  of
              time until the next re-sample test.

       --management socket-name unix [pw-file]      (recommended)
       --management IP port [pw-file]
              Enable  a  management  server on a socket-name Unix socket on those platforms supporting
              it, or on a designated TCP port.

              pw-file , if specified, is a password file where the password must  be  on  first  line.
              Instead  of  a  filename  it  can use the keyword stdin which will prompt the user for a
              password to use when OpenVPN is starting.

              For unix sockets, the  default  behaviour  is to create a unix domain socket that may be
              connected   to   by   any  process.   Use  the  --management-client-user  and  --manage‐
              ment-client-group directives to restrict access.

              The management interface provides a special mode where the TCP management link can oper‐
              ate  over  the  tunnel itself.  To enable this mode, set IP to tunnel.  Tunnel mode will
              cause the  management interface to listen for a TCP connection on the local VPN  address
              of the TUN/TAP interface.

              BEWARE of enabling the management interface over TCP.  In  these cases you should ALWAYS
              make use of pw-file to password protect the management interface.  Any user who can con‐
              nect  to  this  TCP  IP:port will be able to manage and control (and interfere with) the
              OpenVPN process.  It is also strongly recommended to set IP to 127.0.0.1 (localhost)  to
              restrict accessibility of the management server to local clients.

              While  the management port is designed for  programmatic control of OpenVPN by other ap‐
              plications, it is possible to telnet to the port, using a telnet client in  "raw"  mode.
              Once  connected, type "help" for a list of commands.

              For  detailed  documentation  on  the management interface, see the management-notes.txt
              file in the management folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.

       --management-client
              Management interface will connect as a TCP/unix domain client to  IP:port  specified  by
              --management rather than listen as a TCP server or on a unix domain socket.

              If  the  client connection fails to connect or is disconnected, a SIGTERM signal will be
              generated causing OpenVPN to quit.

       --management-query-passwords
              Query management channel for private key password  and  --auth-user-pass  username/pass‐
              word.   Only  query  the  management channel for inputs which ordinarily would have been
              queried from the console.

       --management-query-proxy
              Query  management  channel  for  proxy  server  information  for  a  specific   --remote
              (client-only).

       --management-query-remote
              Allow management interface to override --remote directives (client-only).

       --management-external-key
              Allows usage for external private key file instead of --key option (client-only).

       --management-external-cert certificate-hint
              Allows  usage for external certificate instead of --cert option (client-only).  certifi‐
              cate-hint is an arbitrary string which is passed to a management interface client as  an
              argument of NEED-CERTIFICATE notification.  Requires --management-external-key.

       --management-forget-disconnect
              Make OpenVPN forget passwords when management session disconnects.

              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.  It is always cached.

       --management-hold
              Start OpenVPN in a hibernating state, until a client of the management interface explic‐
              itly starts it with the hold release command.

       --management-signal
              Send SIGUSR1 signal to OpenVPN if management session disconnects.  This is  useful  when
              you  wish  to disconnect an OpenVPN session on user logoff. For --management-client this
              option is not needed since a disconnect will always generate a SIGTERM.

       --management-log-cache n
              Cache the most recent n lines of log file history for usage by the management channel.

       --management-up-down
              Report tunnel up/down events to management interface.

       --management-client-auth
              Gives management interface client the responsibility to authenticate clients after their
              client  certificate has been verified.  See management-notes.txt in OpenVPN distribution
              for detailed notes.

       --management-client-pf
              Management interface clients must specify a  packet  filter  file  for  each  connecting
              client.  See management-notes.txt in OpenVPN distribution for detailed notes.

       --management-client-user u
              When  the  management interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only allow connec‐
              tions from user u.

       --management-client-group g
              When the management interface is listening on a unix domain socket, only  allow  connec‐
              tions from group g.

       --plugin module-pathname [init-string]
              Load plug-in module from the file module-pathname, passing init-string as an argument to
              the module initialization function.  Multiple plugin modules  may  be  loaded  into  one
              OpenVPN process.

              The module-pathname argument can be just a filename or a filename with a relative or ab‐
              solute path.  The format of the filename and path defines if the plug-in will be  loaded
              from a default plug-in directory or outside this directory.

                  --plugin path        Effective directory used
                  ====================================================
                   myplug.so            DEFAULT_DIR/myplug.so
                   subdir/myplug.so     DEFAULT_DIR/subdir/myplug.so
                   ./subdir/myplug.so   CWD/subdir/myplug.so
                   /usr/lib/my/plug.so  /usr/lib/my/plug.so

              DEFAULT_DIR  is  replaced  by  the default plug-in directory, which is configured at the
              build time of OpenVPN.  CWD is the current directory where OpenVPN was  started  or  the
              directory OpenVPN have swithed into via the --cd option before the --plugin option.

              For  more  information  and  examples  on  how to build OpenVPN plug-in modules, see the
              README file in the plugin folder of the OpenVPN source distribution.

              If you are using an RPM install of OpenVPN, see /usr/share/openvpn/plugin.  The documen‐
              tation is in doc and the actual plugin modules are in lib.

              Multiple plugin modules can be cascaded, and modules can be used in tandem with scripts.
              The modules will be called by OpenVPN in the order that they are declared in the  config
              file.  If both a plugin and script are configured for the same callback, the script will
              be called last.  If the return code of  the  module/script  controls  an  authentication
              function (such as tls-verify, auth-user-pass-verify, or client-connect), then every mod‐
              ule and script must return success (0) in order for the connection to be authenticated.

       --keying-material-exporter label len
              Save Exported Keying Material [RFC5705] of len bytes (must be between 16 and 4095 bytes)
              using  label  in  environment  (exported_keying_material)  for  use  by plugins in OPEN‐
              VPN_PLUGIN_TLS_FINAL callback.

              Note that exporter labels have the potential to collide with existing PRF labels. In or‐
              der to prevent this, labels MUST begin with "EXPORTER".

              This option requires OpenSSL 1.0.1 or newer.

   Server Mode
       Starting  with OpenVPN 2.0, a multi-client TCP/UDP server mode is supported, and can be enabled
       with the --mode server option.  In server mode, OpenVPN will listen on a single port for incom‐
       ing  client connections.  All client connections will be routed through a single tun or tap in‐
       terface.  This mode is designed for scalability and should be able to support hundreds or  even
       thousands  of  clients  on  sufficiently fast hardware.  SSL/TLS authentication must be used in
       this mode.

       --server network netmask ['nopool']
              A helper directive designed to simplify the  configuration  of  OpenVPN's  server  mode.
              This  directive  will  set up an OpenVPN server which will allocate addresses to clients
              out of the given network/netmask.  The server itself will take the ".1" address  of  the
              given network for use as the server-side endpoint of the local TUN/TAP interface.

              For example, --server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 expands as follows:

                   mode server
                   tls-server
                   push "topology [topology]"

                   if dev tun AND (topology == net30 OR topology == p2p):
                     ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
                     if !nopool:
                       ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.4 10.8.0.251
                     route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
                     if client-to-client:
                       push "route 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0"
                     else if topology == net30:
                       push "route 10.8.0.1"

                   if dev tap OR (dev tun AND topology == subnet):
                     ifconfig 10.8.0.1 255.255.255.0
                     if !nopool:
                       ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.253 255.255.255.0
                     push "route-gateway 10.8.0.1"
                     if route-gateway unset:
                       route-gateway 10.8.0.2

              Don't use --server if you are ethernet bridging.  Use --server-bridge instead.

       --server-bridge gateway netmask pool-start-IP pool-end-IP

       --server-bridge ['nogw']

              A  helper  directive similar to --server which is designed to simplify the configuration
              of OpenVPN's server mode in ethernet bridging configurations.

              If --server-bridge is used without any parameters, it will  enable  a  DHCP-proxy  mode,
              where  connecting  OpenVPN clients will receive an IP address for their TAP adapter from
              the DHCP server running on the OpenVPN server-side LAN.  Note  that  only  clients  that
              support  the binding of a DHCP client with the TAP adapter (such as Windows) can support
              this mode.  The optional nogw flag (advanced) indicates that gateway information  should
              not be pushed to the client.

              To  configure  ethernet  bridging,  you  must first use your OS's bridging capability to
              bridge the TAP interface with the ethernet NIC interface.  For example, on Linux this is
              done  with  the  brctl  tool,  and with Windows XP it is done in the Network Connections
              Panel by selecting the ethernet and TAP adapters and right-clicking on  "Bridge  Connec‐
              tions".

              Next  you you must manually set the IP/netmask on the bridge interface.  The gateway and
              netmask parameters to --server-bridge can be set to either the IP/netmask of the  bridge
              interface, or the IP/netmask of the default gateway/router on the bridged subnet.

              Finally,  set  aside  a  IP  range  in  the bridged subnet, denoted by pool-start-IP and
              pool-end-IP, for OpenVPN to allocate to connecting clients.

              For example, server-bridge 10.8.0.4 255.255.255.0 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 expands as  fol‐
              lows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server

                  ifconfig-pool 10.8.0.128 10.8.0.254 255.255.255.0
                  push "route-gateway 10.8.0.4"

              In another example, --server-bridge (without parameters) expands as follows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server

                  push "route-gateway dhcp"

              Or --server-bridge nogw expands as follows:

                  mode server
                  tls-server

       --push option
              Push  a  config  file  option back to the client for remote execution.  Note that option
              must be enclosed in double quotes ("").  The client must specify --pull  in  its  config
              file.   The  set of options which can be pushed is limited by both feasibility and secu‐
              rity.  Some options such as those which would execute scripts  are  banned,  since  they
              would  effectively  allow  a compromised server to execute arbitrary code on the client.
              Other options such as TLS or MTU parameters cannot be pushed because the client needs to
              know them before the connection to the server can be initiated.

              This  is a partial list of options which can currently be pushed: --route, --route-gate‐
              way, --route-delay, --redirect-gateway, --ip-win32, --dhcp-option,  --inactive,  --ping,
              --ping-exit,   --ping-restart,  --setenv,  --auth-token,  --persist-key,  --persist-tun,
              --echo, --comp-lzo, --socket-flags, --sndbuf, --rcvbuf

       --push-reset
              Don't inherit the global push list for a specific client instance.  Specify this  option
              in  a  client-specific  context  such  as with a --client-config-dir configuration file.
              This option will ignore --push options at the global config file level.

       --push-remove opt
              selectively remove all --push options matching "opt" from the option list for a  client.
              "opt"  is  matched  as  a  substring against the whole option string to-be-pushed to the
              client, so --push-remove route would remove all --push route ...  and --push  route-ipv6
              ...   statements,  while  --push-remove 'route-ipv6 2001:' would only remove IPv6 routes
              for 2001:... networks.

              --push-remove can only be used in a client-specific context,  like  in  a  --client-con‐
              fig-dir file, or --client-connect script or plugin -- similar to --push-reset, just more
              selective.

              NOTE: to change an option, --push-remove can be used to first remove the old value,  and
              then add a new --push option with the new value.

       --push-peer-info
              Push  additional  information  about the client to server.  The following data is always
              pushed to the server:

              IV_VER=<version> -- the client OpenVPN version

              IV_PLAT=[linux|solaris|openbsd|mac|netbsd|freebsd|win] -- the client OS platform

              IV_LZO_STUB=1 -- if client was built with LZO stub capability

              IV_LZ4=1 -- if the client supports LZ4 compressions.

              IV_PROTO=2 -- if the client supports peer-id floating mechansim

              IV_NCP=2 -- negotiable ciphers, client supports --cipher pushed by the server,  a  value
              of 2 or greater indicates client supports AES-GCM-128 and AES-GCM-256.

              IV_GUI_VER=<gui_id>  <version>  -- the UI version of a UI if one is running, for example
              "de.blinkt.openvpn 0.5.47" for the Android app.

              When --push-peer-info is enabled the additional information consists  of  the  following
              data:

              IV_HWADDR=<mac address> -- the MAC address of clients default gateway

              IV_SSL=<version  string>  -- the ssl version used by the client, e.g. "OpenSSL 1.0.2f 28
              Jan 2016".

              IV_PLAT_VER=x.y - the version of the operating system, e.g. 6.1 for Windows 7.

              UV_<name>=<value> -- client environment variables whose names start with "UV_"

       --disable
              Disable a particular client (based on the common name) from connecting.  Don't use  this
              option  to  disable  a client due to key or password compromise.  Use a CRL (certificate
              revocation list) instead (see the --crl-verify option).

              This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must
              be specified either in a client instance config file using --client-config-dir or dynam‐
              ically generated using a --client-connect script.

       --ifconfig-pool start-IP end-IP [netmask]
              Set aside a pool of subnets to be dynamically allocated to connecting  clients,  similar
              to  a  DHCP  server.  For tun-style tunnels, each client will be given a /30 subnet (for
              interoperability with Windows clients).  For  tap-style  tunnels,  individual  addresses
              will be allocated, and the optional netmask parameter will also be pushed to clients.

       --ifconfig-pool-persist file [seconds]
              Persist/unpersist  ifconfig-pool  data  to  file, at seconds intervals (default=600), as
              well as on program startup and shutdown.

              The goal of this option is to provide a long-term association between  clients  (denoted
              by  their  common  name)  and  the  virtual  IP address assigned to them from the ifcon‐
              fig-pool.  Maintaining a long-term association is good for  clients  because  it  allows
              them to effectively use the --persist-tun option.

              file is a comma-delimited ASCII file, formatted as <Common-Name>,<IP-address>.

              If  seconds = 0, file will be treated as read-only.  This is useful if you would like to
              treat file as a configuration file.

              Note that the entries in this file are treated by OpenVPN as suggestions only, based  on
              past  associations between a common name and IP address.  They do not guarantee that the
              given common name will always receive the given IP address.  If you want guaranteed  as‐
              signment, use --ifconfig-push

       --ifconfig-pool-linear
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              Modifies  the  --ifconfig-pool  directive to allocate individual TUN interface addresses
              for clients rather than /30 subnets.  NOTE:  This option is  incompatible  with  Windows
              clients.

              This option is deprecated, and should be replaced with --topology p2p which is function‐
              ally equivalent.

       --ifconfig-push local remote-netmask [alias]
              Push virtual IP endpoints for client tunnel, overriding the --ifconfig-pool dynamic  al‐
              location.

              The  parameters  local  and remote-netmask are set according to the --ifconfig directive
              which you want to execute on the client machine to configure the remote end of the  tun‐
              nel.   Note that the parameters local and remote-netmask are from the perspective of the
              client, not the server.  They may be DNS names rather than IP addresses, in  which  case
              they will be resolved on the server at the time of client connection.

              The  optional  alias  parameter may be used in cases where NAT causes the client view of
              its local endpoint to differ from the server view.  In  this  case  local/remote-netmask
              will refer to the server view while alias/remote-netmask will refer to the client view.

              This option must be associated with a specific client instance, which means that it must
              be specified either in a client instance config file using --client-config-dir or dynam‐
              ically generated using a --client-connect script.

              Remember  also  to include a --route directive in the main OpenVPN config file which en‐
              closes local, so that the kernel will know to route it to the  server's  TUN/TAP  inter‐
              face.

              OpenVPN's internal client IP address selection algorithm works as follows:

              1 -- Use --client-connect script generated file for static IP (first choice).
              2 -- Use --client-config-dir file for static IP (next choice).
              3 -- Use --ifconfig-pool allocation for dynamic IP (last choice).

       --iroute network [netmask]
              Generate  an internal route to a specific client. The netmask parameter, if omitted, de‐
              faults to 255.255.255.255.

              This directive can be used to route a fixed subnet  from  the  server  to  a  particular
              client,  regardless of where the client is connecting from.  Remember that you must also
              add the route to the system routing table as well (such as by using the  --route  direc‐
              tive).   The  reason  why two routes are needed is that the --route directive routes the
              packet from the kernel to OpenVPN.  Once in OpenVPN, the --iroute  directive  routes  to
              the specific client.

              This   option  must  be  specified  either  in  a  client  instance  config  file  using
              --client-config-dir or dynamically generated using a --client-connect script.

              The --iroute directive also has  an  important  interaction  with  --push  "route  ...".
              --iroute  essentially  defines  a  subnet which is owned by a particular client (we will
              call this client A).  If you would like other clients to be able to  reach  A's  subnet,
              you can use --push "route ..."  together with --client-to-client to effect this.  In or‐
              der for all clients to see A's subnet, OpenVPN must push this route to all  clients  EX‐
              CEPT  for  A,  since the subnet is already owned by A.  OpenVPN accomplishes this by not
              not pushing a route to a client if it matches one of the client's iroutes.

       --client-to-client
              Because the OpenVPN server mode handles multiple clients through a single tun or tap in‐
              terface,  it  is effectively a router.  The --client-to-client flag tells OpenVPN to in‐
              ternally route client-to-client traffic rather than pushing all client-originating traf‐
              fic to the TUN/TAP interface.

              When  this  option is used, each client will "see" the other clients which are currently
              connected.  Otherwise, each client will only see the server.  Don't use this  option  if
              you want to firewall tunnel traffic using custom, per-client rules.

       --duplicate-cn
              Allow  multiple  clients  with the same common name to concurrently connect.  In the ab‐
              sence of this option, OpenVPN will disconnect a client instance upon connection of a new
              client having the same common name.

       --client-connect cmd
              Run command cmd on client connection.

              cmd  consists  of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed by argu‐
              ments. The path and arguments may be single- or double-quoted  and/or  escaped  using  a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              The command is passed the common name and IP address of the just-authenticated client as
              environmental variables (see environmental variable section below).  The command is also
              passed  the pathname of a freshly created temporary file as the last argument (after any
              arguments specified in cmd ), to be used by the command to  pass  dynamically  generated
              config file directives back to OpenVPN.

              If  the  script wants to generate a dynamic config file to be applied on the server when
              the client connects, it should write it to the file named by the last argument.

              See the --client-config-dir option below for options which can be legally used in a  dy‐
              namically generated config file.

              Note that the return value of script is significant.  If script returns a non-zero error
              status, it will cause the client to be disconnected.

       --client-disconnect cmd
              Like --client-connect but called on client instance shutdown.  Will not be called unless
              the  --client-connect script and plugins (if defined) were previously called on this in‐
              stance with successful (0) status returns.

              The exception to this rule is if the --client-disconnect command  or  plugins  are  cas‐
              caded,  and  at least one client-connect function succeeded, then ALL of the client-dis‐
              connect functions for scripts and plugins will be called on client instance object dele‐
              tion, even in cases where some of the related client-connect functions returned an error
              status.

              The --client-disconnect command  is  passed  the  same  pathname  as  the  corresponding
              --client-connect command as its last argument. (after any arguments specified in cmd ).

       --client-config-dir dir
              Specify  a  directory dir for custom client config files.  After a connecting client has
              been authenticated, OpenVPN will look in this directory for a file having the same  name
              as  the  client's  X509  common  name.  If a matching file exists, it will be opened and
              parsed for client-specific configuration options.  If no matching file is found, OpenVPN
              will  instead  try  to open and parse a default file called "DEFAULT", which may be pro‐
              vided but is not required. Note that the configuration files must  be  readable  by  the
              OpenVPN process after it has dropped it's root privileges.

              This  file  can  specify a fixed IP address for a given client using --ifconfig-push, as
              well as fixed subnets owned by the client using --iroute.

              One of the useful properties of this option is that it allows client configuration files
              to be conveniently created, edited, or removed while the server is live, without needing
              to restart the server.

              The following options are legal in  a  client-specific  context:  --push,  --push-reset,
              --push-remove, --iroute, --ifconfig-push, and --config.

       --ccd-exclusive
              Require,  as a condition of authentication, that a connecting client has a --client-con‐
              fig-dir file.

       --tmp-dir dir
              Specify a directory dir for temporary files.  This directory will  be  used  by  openvpn
              processes  and script to communicate temporary data with openvpn main process. Note that
              the directory must be writable by the OpenVPN process after it  has  dropped  it's  root
              privileges.

              This directory will be used by in the following cases:

              * --client-connect scripts to dynamically generate client-specific configuration files.

              *   OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY  plugin  hook  to  return  success/failure  via
              auth_control_file when using deferred auth method

              * OPENVPN_PLUGIN_ENABLE_PF plugin hook to pass filtering rules via pf_file

       --hash-size r v
              Set the size of the real address hash table to r and the virtual address table to v.  By
              default, both tables are sized at 256 buckets.

       --bcast-buffers n
              Allocate n buffers for broadcast datagrams (default=256).

       --tcp-queue-limit n
              Maximum number of output packets queued before TCP (default=64).

              When  OpenVPN is tunneling data from a TUN/TAP device to a remote client over a TCP con‐
              nection, it is possible that the TUN/TAP device might produce data at a faster rate than
              the TCP connection can support.  When the number of output packets queued before sending
              to the TCP socket reaches this limit for a given client connection, OpenVPN  will  start
              to drop outgoing packets directed at this client.

       --tcp-nodelay
              This  macro  sets the TCP_NODELAY socket flag on the server as well as pushes it to con‐
              necting clients.  The TCP_NODELAY flag disables the Nagle algorithm on TCP sockets caus‐
              ing  packets to be transmitted immediately with low latency, rather than waiting a short
              period of time in order to aggregate several packets into a  larger  containing  packet.
              In VPN applications over TCP, TCP_NODELAY is generally a good latency optimization.

              The macro expands as follows:

                   if mode server:
                     socket-flags TCP_NODELAY
                     push "socket-flags TCP_NODELAY"

       --max-clients n
              Limit server to a maximum of n concurrent clients.

       --max-routes-per-client n
              Allow a maximum of n internal routes per client (default=256).  This is designed to help
              contain DoS attacks where an authenticated client floods the server with packets appear‐
              ing to come from many unique MAC addresses, forcing the server to deplete virtual memory
              as its internal routing table expands.  This directive can be used  in  a  --client-con‐
              fig-dir file or auto-generated by a --client-connect script to override the global value
              for a particular client.

              Note that this directive affects OpenVPN's internal routing table, not the kernel  rout‐
              ing table.

       --stale-routes-check n [t]
              Remove routes haven't had activity for n seconds (i.e. the ageing time).

              This check is ran every t seconds (i.e. check interval).

              If t is not present it defaults to n

              This   option   helps   to   keep   the   dynamic   routing   table   small.   See  also
              --max-routes-per-client

       --connect-freq n sec
              Allow a maximum of n new connections per sec seconds from clients.  This is designed  to
              contain  DoS  attacks which flood the server with connection requests using certificates
              which will ultimately fail to authenticate.

              This is an imperfect solution however, because in a real DoS scenario,  legitimate  con‐
              nections might also be refused.

              For  the  best protection against DoS attacks in server mode, use --proto udp and either
              --tls-auth or --tls-crypt.

       --learn-address cmd
              Run command cmd to validate client virtual addresses or routes.

              cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed  by  argu‐
              ments.  The  path  and  arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              Three arguments will be appended to any arguments in cmd as follows:

              [1] operation -- "add", "update", or "delete" based on whether or not the address is be‐
              ing added to, modified, or deleted from OpenVPN's internal routing table.
              [2] address -- The address being learned or unlearned.  This can be an IPv4 address such
              as "198.162.10.14", an IPv4 subnet such as "198.162.10.0/24", or an ethernet MAC address
              (when --dev tap is being used) such as "00:FF:01:02:03:04".
              [3]  common name -- The common name on the certificate associated with the client linked
              to this address.  Only present for "add" or "update" operations, not "delete".

              On "add" or "update" methods, if the script returns a failure code  (non-zero),  OpenVPN
              will reject the address and will not modify its internal routing table.

              Normally,  the  cmd  script  will  use the information provided above to set appropriate
              firewall entries on the VPN TUN/TAP interface.  Since OpenVPN provides  the  association
              between  virtual IP or MAC address and the client's authenticated common name, it allows
              a user-defined script to configure firewall access policies with regard to the  client's
              high-level common name, rather than the low level client virtual addresses.

       --auth-user-pass-verify cmd method
              Require the client to provide a username/password (possibly in addition to a client cer‐
              tificate) for authentication.

              OpenVPN will run command cmd to validate the username/password provided by the client.

              cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed  by  argu‐
              ments.  The  path  and  arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              If method is set to "via-env", OpenVPN will call script with the environmental variables
              username  and  password set to the username/password strings provided by the client.  Be
              aware that this method is insecure on some platforms which make  the  environment  of  a
              process publicly visible to other unprivileged processes.

              If  method  is  set  to  "via-file", OpenVPN will write the username and password to the
              first two lines of a temporary file.  The filename will be  passed  as  an  argument  to
              script,  and the file will be automatically deleted by OpenVPN after the script returns.
              The location of the temporary file is controlled by the --tmp-dir option, and  will  de‐
              fault to the current directory if unspecified.  For security, consider setting --tmp-dir
              to a volatile storage medium such as  /dev/shm  (if  available)  to  prevent  the  user‐
              name/password file from touching the hard drive.

              The  script  should examine the username and password, returning a success exit code (0)
              if the client's authentication request is to be accepted, or a failure code (1)  to  re‐
              ject the client.

              This  directive  is  designed to enable a plugin-style interface for extending OpenVPN's
              authentication capabilities.

              To protect against a client passing a maliciously formed username  or  password  string,
              the username string must consist only of these characters: alphanumeric, underbar ('_'),
              dash ('-'), dot ('.'), or at ('@').  The password string can consist  of  any  printable
              characters  except for CR or LF.  Any illegal characters in either the username or pass‐
              word string will be converted to underbar ('_').

              Care must be taken by any user-defined scripts to avoid creating a security  vulnerabil‐
              ity  in  the  way that these strings are handled.  Never use these strings in such a way
              that they might be escaped or evaluated by a shell interpreter.

              For a sample script that performs PAM authentication, see sample-scripts/auth-pam.pl  in
              the OpenVPN source distribution.

       --auth-gen-token [lifetime]
              After  successful user/password authentication, the OpenVPN server will with this option
              generate a temporary authentication token and push that to  client.   On  the  following
              renegotiations,  the  OpenVPN client will pass this token instead of the users password.
              On the server side the server will do the token authentication internally  and  it  will
              NOT  do any additional authentications against configured external user/password authen‐
              tication mechanisms.

              The lifetime argument defines how long the generated token is valid.   The  lifetime  is
              defined  in seconds.  If lifetime is not set or it is set to 0, the token will never ex‐
              pire.

              This feature is useful for environments which is configured to use  One  Time  Passwords
              (OTP)  as  part  of  the user/password authentications and that authentication mechanism
              does not implement any auth-token support.

       --opt-verify
              Clients that connect with options that are incompatible with those of the server will be
              disconnected.

              Options  that  will  be  compared for compatibility include dev-type, link-mtu, tun-mtu,
              proto, ifconfig, comp-lzo, fragment, keydir, cipher, auth, keysize,  secret,  no-replay,
              no-iv, tls-auth, key-method, tls-server, and tls-client.

              This option requires that --disable-occ NOT be used.

       --auth-user-pass-optional
              Allow  connections  by  clients that do not specify a username/password.  Normally, when
              --auth-user-pass-verify or --management-client-auth is specified (or  an  authentication
              plugin  module),  the OpenVPN server daemon will require connecting clients to specify a
              username and password.  This option makes  the  submission  of  a  username/password  by
              clients  optional,  passing  the  responsibility to the user-defined authentication mod‐
              ule/script to accept or deny the client based on other factors (such as the  setting  of
              X509  certificate  fields).   When this option is used, and a connecting client does not
              submit a username/password, the user-defined authentication module/script will  see  the
              username  and  password  as  being  set  to empty strings ("").  The authentication mod‐
              ule/script MUST have logic to detect this condition and respond accordingly.

       --client-cert-not-required
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              Don't require client certificate, client will authenticate using username/password only.
              Be  aware  that using this directive is less secure than requiring certificates from all
              clients.

              Please note: This is replaced by --verify-client-cert which allows for more flexibility.
              The option --verify-client-cert none is functionally equivalent to --client-cert-not-re‐
              quired

       --verify-client-cert none|optional|require
              Specify whether the client is required to supply a valid certificate.

              Possible options are

              none : a client certificate is not required. the client need to authenticate using user‐
              name/password  only.   Be  aware that using this directive is less secure than requiring
              certificates from all clients.

              If you use this directive, the entire responsibility of authentication will rest on your
              --auth-user-pass-verify  script,  so  keep in mind that bugs in your script could poten‐
              tially compromise the security of your VPN.

              --verify-client-cert none is functionally equivalent to --client-cert-not-required.

              optional : a client may present a certificate but it is not required to do so.  When us‐
              ing  this directive, you should also use a --auth-user-pass-verify script to ensure that
              clients are authenticated using a certificate, a username and password, or possibly even
              both.

              Again,    the    entire   responsibility   of   authentication   will   rest   on   your
              --auth-user-pass-verify script, so keep in mind that bugs in your  script  could  poten‐
              tially compromise the security of your VPN.

              require  :  this  is  the default option. A client is required to present a certificate,
              otherwise VPN access is refused.

              If you don't use this directive (or use --verify-client-cert  require  )  but  you  also
              specify  an --auth-user-pass-verify script, then OpenVPN will perform double authentica‐
              tion.  The client certificate verification AND the --auth-user-pass-verify  script  will
              need to succeed in order for a client to be authenticated and accepted onto the VPN.

       --username-as-common-name
              For --auth-user-pass-verify authentication, use the authenticated username as the common
              name, rather than the common name from the client cert.

       --compat-names [no-remapping]
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              Until OpenVPN v2.3 the format of the X.509 Subject fields was formatted like this:

              /C=US/L=Somewhere/CN=John Doe/emailAddress=john@example.com

              In addition the old behaviour was to remap any character other than alphanumeric, under‐
              score ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and slash ('/') to underscore ('_').  The X.509 Sub‐
              ject string as returned by the tls_id environmental variable, could additionally contain
              colon (':') or equal ('=').

              When  using  the --compat-names option, this old formatting and remapping will be re-en‐
              abled again.  This is purely implemented for  compatibility  reasons  when  using  older
              plug-ins or scripts which does not handle the new formatting or UTF-8 characters.

              In  OpenVPN  2.3 the formatting of these fields changed into a more standardised format.
              It now looks like:

              C=US, L=Somewhere, CN=John Doe, emailAddress=john@example.com

              The new default format in OpenVPN 2.3 also does not do  the  character  remapping  which
              happened  earlier.   This  new format enables proper support for UTF-8 characters in the
              usernames, X.509 Subject fields and Common Name variables and it  complies  to  the  RFC
              2253, UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names.

              The  no-remapping  mode flag can be used with the --compat-names option to be compatible
              with the now deprecated --no-name-remapping option.  It is only available at the server.
              When  this mode flag is used, the Common Name, Subject, and username strings are allowed
              to include any printable character including space,  but  excluding  control  characters
              such  as tab, newline, and carriage-return. no-remapping is only available on the server
              side.

              Please note: This option is immediately deprecated.  It is only implemented to make  the
              transition to the new formatting less intrusive.  It will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  So
              please update your scripts/plug-ins where necessary.

       --no-name-remapping
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              The --no-name-remapping option is an alias for --compat-names no-remapping.  It  ensures
              compatibility with server configurations using the --no-name-remapping option.

              Please  note:  This  option  is  now deprecated.  It will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  So
              please make sure you support the new X.509 name formatting  described  with  the  --com‐
              pat-names option as soon as possible.

       --port-share host port [dir]
              When run in TCP server mode, share the OpenVPN port with another application, such as an
              HTTPS server.  If OpenVPN senses a connection to its port which is using  a  non-OpenVPN
              protocol,  it  will proxy the connection to the server at host:port.  Currently only de‐
              signed to work with HTTP/HTTPS, though it would be theoretically possible to  extend  to
              other protocols such as ssh.

              dir  specifies  an optional directory where a temporary file with name N containing con‐
              tent C will be dynamically generated for each proxy connection, where N  is  the  source
              IP:port  of  the  client connection and C is the source IP:port of the connection to the
              proxy receiver.  This directory can be used as a dictionary by the proxy receiver to de‐
              termine the origin of the connection.  Each generated file will be automatically deleted
              when the proxied connection is torn down.

              Not implemented on Windows.

   Client Mode
       Use client mode when connecting to an OpenVPN server which has  --server,  --server-bridge,  or
       --mode server in it's configuration.

       --client
              A  helper  directive  designed  to  simplify the configuration of OpenVPN's client mode.
              This directive is equivalent to:

                   pull
                   tls-client

       --pull This option must be used on a client which is connecting to a multi-client  server.   It
              indicates  to  OpenVPN that it should accept options pushed by the server, provided they
              are part of the legal set of pushable options (note that the --pull option is implied by
              --client ).

              In  particular, --pull allows the server to push routes to the client, so you should not
              use --pull or --client in situations where you don't trust the server  to  have  control
              over the client's routing table.

       --pull-filter accept|ignore|reject text
              Filter options received from the server if the option starts with text.  Runs on client.
              The action flag accept allows the option, ignore removes it and reject  flags  an  error
              and  triggers  a SIGUSR1 restart.  The filters may be specified multiple times, and each
              filter is applied in the order it is specified. The filtering of each  option  stops  as
              soon as a match is found. Unmatched options are accepted by default.

              Prefix comparison is used to match text against the received option so that

                  --pull-filter ignore "route"

              would  remove  all  pushed options starting with route which would include, for example,
              route-gateway.  Enclose text in quotes to embed spaces.

                  --pull-filter accept "route 192.168.1."
                  --pull-filter ignore "route "

              would remove all routes that do not start with 192.168.1.

              This option may be used only on clients.  Note that reject may result in a repeated  cy‐
              cle  of  failure  and reconnect, unless multiple remotes are specified and connection to
              the next remote succeeds. To silently ignore an option pushed by the server, use ignore.

       --auth-user-pass [up]
              Authenticate with server  using  username/password.   up  is  a  file  containing  user‐
              name/password on 2 lines. If the password line is missing, OpenVPN will prompt for one.

              If up is omitted, username/password will be prompted from the console.

              The  server  configuration  must specify an --auth-user-pass-verify script to verify the
              username/password provided by the client.

       --auth-retry type
              Controls how OpenVPN responds to  username/password  verification  errors  such  as  the
              client-side  response  to an AUTH_FAILED message from the server or verification failure
              of the private key password.

              Normally used to prevent auth errors from being fatal on the client side, and to  permit
              username/password requeries in case of error.

              An  AUTH_FAILED  message is generated by the server if the client fails --auth-user-pass
              authentication, or if the server-side --client-connect script returns  an  error  status
              when the client tries to connect.

              type can be one of:

              none -- Client will exit with a fatal error (this is the default).
              nointeract   --   Client   will   retry   the   connection  without  requerying  for  an
              --auth-user-pass username/password.  Use this option for unattended clients.
              interact -- Client will requery for an --auth-user-pass username/password and/or private
              key password before attempting a reconnection.

              Note  that  while this option cannot be pushed, it can be controlled from the management
              interface.

       --static-challenge t e
              Enable static challenge/response protocol using challenge text t, with echo  flag  given
              by e (0|1).

              The  echo  flag  indicates whether or not the user's response to the challenge should be
              echoed.

              See management-notes.txt in the OpenVPN distribution for a description  of  the  OpenVPN
              challenge/response protocol.

       --server-poll-timeout n, --connect-timeout n
              When connecting to a remote server do not wait for more than n seconds waiting for a re‐
              sponse before trying the next server.  The default value is 120s. This timeout  includes
              proxy and TCP connect timeouts.

       --explicit-exit-notify [n]
              In UDP client mode or point-to-point mode, send server/peer an exit notification if tun‐
              nel is restarted or OpenVPN process is exited.  In client mode,  on  exit/restart,  this
              option  will tell the server to immediately close its client instance object rather than
              waiting for a timeout.  The n parameter (default=1) controls the maximum number  of  at‐
              tempts that the client will try to resend the exit notification message.

              In UDP server mode, send RESTART control channel command to connected clients. The n pa‐
              rameter (default=1) controls client behavior. With n = 1 client will attempt  to  recon‐
              nect to the same server, with n = 2 client will advance to the next server.

              OpenVPN will not send any exit notifications unless this option is enabled.

       --allow-recursive-routing
              When  this  option is set, OpenVPN will not drop incoming tun packets with same destina‐
              tion as host.

   Data Channel Encryption Options:
       These options are meaningful for both Static & TLS-negotiated key modes (must be compatible be‐
       tween peers).

       --secret file [direction]
              Enable  Static Key encryption mode (non-TLS).  Use pre-shared secret file which was gen‐
              erated with --genkey.

              The optional direction parameter enables the use of  4  distinct  keys  (HMAC-send,  ci‐
              pher-encrypt, HMAC-receive, cipher-decrypt), so that each data flow direction has a dif‐
              ferent set of HMAC and cipher keys.  This has a number of desirable security  properties
              including eliminating certain kinds of DoS and message replay attacks.

              When  the  direction parameter is omitted, 2 keys are used bidirectionally, one for HMAC
              and the other for encryption/decryption.

              The direction parameter should always be complementary on either side of the connection,
              i.e.  one side should use "0" and the other should use "1", or both sides should omit it
              altogether.

              The direction parameter requires that file contains a 2048 bit key.  While pre-1.5  ver‐
              sions  of OpenVPN generate 1024 bit key files, any version of OpenVPN which supports the
              direction parameter, will also support 2048 bit key file generation using  the  --genkey
              option.

              Static  key encryption mode has certain advantages, the primary being ease of configura‐
              tion.

              There are no certificates or certificate authorities or  complicated  negotiation  hand‐
              shakes and protocols.  The only requirement is that you have a pre-existing secure chan‐
              nel with your peer (such as ssh ) to initially copy the key.   This  requirement,  along
              with  the fact that your key never changes unless you manually generate a new one, makes
              it somewhat less secure than TLS mode (see below).  If an attacker manages to steal your
              key,  everything  that  was ever encrypted with it is compromised.  Contrast that to the
              perfect forward secrecy features of TLS mode (using Diffie Hellman key exchange),  where
              even  if an attacker was able to steal your private key, he would gain no information to
              help him decrypt past sessions.

              Another advantageous aspect of Static Key encryption mode is that it is a handshake-free
              protocol  without  any distinguishing signature or feature (such as a header or protocol
              handshake sequence) that would mark the ciphertext packets as being generated  by  Open‐
              VPN.  Anyone eavesdropping on the wire would see nothing but random-looking data.

       --key-direction
              Alternative  way  of  specifying the optional direction parameter for the --tls-auth and
              --secret options. Useful when using inline files (See section on inline files).

       --auth alg
              Authenticate data channel packets and (if enabled) tls-auth control channel packets with
              HMAC  using  message  digest algorithm alg.  (The default is SHA1 ).  HMAC is a commonly
              used message authentication algorithm (MAC) that uses a data string, a secure hash algo‐
              rithm, and a key, to produce a digital signature.

              The  OpenVPN  data  channel protocol uses encrypt-then-mac (i.e. first encrypt a packet,
              then HMAC the resulting ciphertext), which prevents padding oracle attacks.

              If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen, the specified --auth algorithm  is  ignored
              for  the data channel, and the authentication method of the AEAD cipher is used instead.
              Note that alg still specifies the digest used for tls-auth.

              In static-key encryption mode, the HMAC key is included in the  key  file  generated  by
              --genkey.   In  TLS mode, the HMAC key is dynamically generated and shared between peers
              via the TLS control channel.  If OpenVPN receives a packet with a bad HMAC it will  drop
              the  packet.   HMAC usually adds 16 or 20 bytes per packet.  Set alg=none to disable au‐
              thentication.

              For more information on HMAC see http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/papers/hmac.html

       --cipher alg
              Encrypt data channel packets with cipher algorithm alg.

              The default is BF-CBC, an abbreviation for Blowfish in Cipher Block Chaining mode.  When
              cipher  negotiation  (NCP)  is  allowed, OpenVPN 2.4 and newer on both client and server
              side will automatically upgrade to AES-256-GCM.  See --ncp-ciphers and --ncp-disable for
              more details on NCP.

              Using  BF-CBC  is  no  longer recommended, because of its 64-bit block size.  This small
              block size allows  attacks  based  on  collisions,  as  demonstrated  by  SWEET32.   See
              https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/SWEET32  for  details.   Due to this, support
              for BF-CBC, DES, CAST5, IDEA and RC2 ciphers will be removed in OpenVPN 2.6.

              To see other ciphers that are available with OpenVPN, use the --show-ciphers option.

              Set alg=none to disable encryption.

       --ncp-ciphers cipher_list
              Restrict the allowed ciphers to be  negotiated  to  the  ciphers  in  cipher_list.   ci‐
              pher_list    is    a    colon-separated    list    of    ciphers,    and   defaults   to
              "AES-256-GCM:AES-128-GCM".

              For servers, the first cipher from cipher_list will be pushed to  clients  that  support
              cipher negotiation.

              Cipher  negotiation  is  enabled  in  client-server mode only.  I.e. if --mode is set to
              'server' (server-side, implied  by  setting  --server  ),  or  if  --pull  is  specified
              (client-side, implied by setting --client).

              If  both  peers  support and do not disable NCP, the negotiated cipher will override the
              cipher specified by --cipher.

              Additionally, to allow for more smooth transition, if NCP is enabled, OpenVPN  will  in‐
              herit  the  cipher  of the peer if that cipher is different from the local --cipher set‐
              ting, but the peer cipher is one of the ciphers  specified  in  --ncp-ciphers.   E.g.  a
              non-NCP  client  (<=v2.3, or with --ncp-disabled set) connecting to a NCP server (v2.4+)
              with "--cipher BF-CBC" and "--ncp-ciphers AES-256-GCM:AES-256-CBC" set can either  spec‐
              ify "--cipher BF-CBC" or "--cipher AES-256-CBC" and both will work.

       --ncp-disable
              Disable "negotiable crypto parameters".  This completely disables cipher negotiation.

       --keysize n
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.6.

              Size  of cipher key in bits (optional).  If unspecified, defaults to cipher-specific de‐
              fault.  The --show-ciphers option (see below) shows all available OpenSSL ciphers, their
              default  key sizes, and whether the key size can be changed.  Use care in changing a ci‐
              pher's default key size.  Many ciphers have  not  been  extensively  cryptanalyzed  with
              non-standard  key lengths, and a larger key may offer no real guarantee of greater secu‐
              rity, or may even reduce security.

       --prng alg [nsl]
              (Advanced) For PRNG (Pseudo-random number generator),  use  digest  algorithm  alg  (de‐
              fault=sha1),  and  set  nsl (default=16) to the size in bytes of the nonce secret length
              (between 16 and 64).

              Set alg=none to disable the PRNG and use the OpenSSL RAND_bytes function instead for all
              of OpenVPN's pseudo-random number needs.

       --engine [engine-name]
              Enable OpenSSL hardware-based crypto engine functionality.

              If  engine-name  is  specified,  use  a  specific crypto engine.  Use the --show-engines
              standalone option to list the crypto engines which are supported by OpenSSL.

       --no-replay
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.

              (Advanced) Disable OpenVPN's protection against replay attacks.  Don't use  this  option
              unless  you  are  prepared to make a tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange for less
              security.

              OpenVPN provides datagram replay protection by default.

              Replay protection is accomplished by tagging each outgoing datagram with  an  identifier
              that  is  guaranteed  to  be  unique for the key being used.  The peer that receives the
              datagram will check for the uniqueness of the identifier.  If the identifier was already
              received in a previous datagram, OpenVPN will drop the packet.  Replay protection is im‐
              portant to defeat attacks such as a SYN flood attack, where the attacker listens in  the
              wire,  intercepts  a TCP SYN packet (identifying it by the context in which it occurs in
              relation to other packets), then floods the receiving peer with copies of this packet.

              OpenVPN's replay protection is implemented in slightly different ways, depending on  the
              key management mode you have selected.

              In Static Key mode or when using an CFB or OFB mode cipher, OpenVPN uses a 64 bit unique
              identifier that combines a time stamp with an incrementing sequence number.

              When using TLS mode for key exchange and a CBC cipher mode, OpenVPN uses only a  32  bit
              sequence number without a time stamp, since OpenVPN can guarantee the uniqueness of this
              value for each key.  As in IPSec, if the sequence number is close to  wrapping  back  to
              zero, OpenVPN will trigger a new key exchange.

              To check for replays, OpenVPN uses the sliding window algorithm used by IPSec.

       --replay-window n [t]
              Use a replay protection sliding-window of size n and a time window of t seconds.

              By default n is 64 (the IPSec default) and t is 15 seconds.

              This option is only relevant in UDP mode, i.e.  when either --proto udp is specified, or
              no --proto option is specified.

              When OpenVPN tunnels IP packets over UDP, there is the possibility that packets might be
              dropped or delivered out of order.  Because OpenVPN, like IPSec, is emulating the physi‐
              cal network layer, it will accept an out-of-order packet sequence, and will deliver such
              packets in the same order they were received to the TCP/IP protocol stack, provided they
              satisfy several constraints.

              (a) The packet cannot be a replay (unless --no-replay is specified, which  disables  re‐
              play protection altogether).

              (b) If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if the difference between
              its sequence number and the highest sequence number received so far is less than n.

              (c) If a packet arrives out of order, it will only be accepted if it  arrives  no  later
              than t seconds after any packet containing a higher sequence number.

              If you are using a network link with a large pipeline (meaning that the product of band‐
              width and latency is high), you may want to use a larger value for n.   Satellite  links
              in particular often require this.

              If  you  run  OpenVPN at --verb 4, you will see the message "Replay-window backtrack oc‐
              curred [x]" every time the maximum sequence number backtrack seen  thus  far  increases.
              This can be used to calibrate n.

              There is some controversy on the appropriate method of handling packet reordering at the
              security layer.

              Namely, to what extent should the security layer protect the encapsulated protocol  from
              attacks  which  masquerade  as the kinds of normal packet loss and reordering that occur
              over IP networks?

              The IPSec and OpenVPN approach is to allow packet reordering within a certain fixed  se‐
              quence number window.

              OpenVPN  adds to the IPSec model by limiting the window size in time as well as sequence
              space.

              OpenVPN also adds TCP transport as an option (not offered by IPSec) in which case  Open‐
              VPN can adopt a very strict attitude towards message deletion and reordering:  Don't al‐
              low it.  Since TCP guarantees reliability, any packet loss or reordering  event  can  be
              assumed to be an attack.

              In  this sense, it could be argued that TCP tunnel transport is preferred when tunneling
              non-IP or UDP application protocols which might be vulnerable to a message  deletion  or
              reordering attack which falls within the normal operational parameters of IP networks.

              So  I would make the statement that one should never tunnel a non-IP protocol or UDP ap‐
              plication protocol over UDP, if the protocol might be vulnerable to a  message  deletion
              or  reordering attack that falls within the normal operating parameters of what is to be
              expected from the physical IP layer.  The problem is easily fixed by simply using TCP as
              the VPN transport layer.

       --mute-replay-warnings
              Silence  the output of replay warnings, which are a common false alarm on WiFi networks.
              This option preserves the security of the replay protection code without  the  verbosity
              associated with warnings about duplicate packets.

       --replay-persist file
              Persist replay-protection state across sessions using file to save and reload the state.

              This  option  will strengthen protection against replay attacks, especially when you are
              using OpenVPN in a dynamic context (such as with --inetd) when OpenVPN sessions are fre‐
              quently started and stopped.

              This  option will keep a disk copy of the current replay protection state (i.e. the most
              recent packet timestamp and sequence number received from the remote peer), so  that  if
              an OpenVPN session is stopped and restarted, it will reject any replays of packets which
              were already received by the prior session.

              This option only makes sense when replay protection is enabled (the default) and you are
              using either --secret (shared-secret key mode) or TLS mode with --tls-auth.

       --no-iv
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.

              (Advanced)  Disable  OpenVPN's use of IV (cipher initialization vector).  Don't use this
              option unless you are prepared to make a tradeoff of greater efficiency in exchange  for
              less security.

              OpenVPN  uses  an IV by default, and requires it for CFB and OFB cipher modes (which are
              totally insecure without it).  Using an IV is important for security when multiple  mes‐
              sages are being encrypted/decrypted with the same key.

              IV is implemented differently depending on the cipher mode used.

              In CBC mode, OpenVPN uses a pseudo-random IV for each packet.

              In  CFB/OFB  mode,  OpenVPN  uses a unique sequence number and time stamp as the IV.  In
              fact, in CFB/OFB mode, OpenVPN uses a datagram space-saving optimization that  uses  the
              unique identifier for datagram replay protection as the IV.

       --use-prediction-resistance
              Enable prediction resistance on mbed TLS's RNG.

              Enabling prediction resistance causes the RNG to reseed in each call for random. Reseed‐
              ing this often can quickly deplete the kernel entropy pool.

              If you need this option, please consider running a daemon that adds entropy to the  ker‐
              nel pool.

       --test-crypto
              Do a self-test of OpenVPN's crypto options by encrypting and decrypting test packets us‐
              ing the data channel encryption options specified above.  This option does not require a
              peer to function, and therefore can be specified without --dev or --remote.

              The typical usage of --test-crypto would be something like this:

              openvpn --test-crypto --secret key

              or

              openvpn --test-crypto --secret key --verb 9

              This  option  is very useful to test OpenVPN after it has been ported to a new platform,
              or to isolate problems in the compiler, OpenSSL  crypto  library,  or  OpenVPN's  crypto
              code.   Since it is a self-test mode, problems with encryption and authentication can be
              debugged independently of network and tunnel issues.

   TLS Mode Options:
       TLS mode is the most powerful crypto mode of OpenVPN in both  security  and  flexibility.   TLS
       mode  works  by  establishing  control  and  data  channels which are multiplexed over a single
       TCP/UDP port.  OpenVPN initiates a TLS session over the control channel and uses it to exchange
       cipher  and  HMAC  keys  to protect the data channel.  TLS mode uses a robust reliability layer
       over the UDP connection for all control channel communication, while  the  data  channel,  over
       which encrypted tunnel data passes, is forwarded without any mediation.  The result is the best
       of both worlds: a fast data channel that forwards over UDP with only the overhead  of  encrypt,
       decrypt,  and  HMAC functions, and a control channel that provides all of the security features
       of TLS, including certificate-based authentication and Diffie Hellman forward secrecy.

       To use TLS mode, each peer that runs OpenVPN should have its own local certificate/key  pair  (
       --cert and --key ), signed by the root certificate which is specified in --ca.

       When  two  OpenVPN  peers connect, each presents its local certificate to the other.  Each peer
       will then check that its partner peer presented a certificate which was signed  by  the  master
       root certificate as specified in --ca.

       If that check on both peers succeeds, then the TLS negotiation will succeed, both OpenVPN peers
       will exchange temporary session keys, and the tunnel will begin passing data.

       The OpenVPN  project  provides  a  set  of  scripts  for  managing  RSA  certificates  &  keys:
       https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa

       --tls-server
              Enable  TLS  and assume server role during TLS handshake.  Note that OpenVPN is designed
              as a peer-to-peer application.  The designation of client or server is only for the pur‐
              pose of negotiating the TLS control channel.

       --tls-client
              Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake.

       --ca file
              Certificate  authority  (CA)  file in .pem format, also referred to as the root certifi‐
              cate.  This file can have multiple certificates in .pem format,  concatenated  together.
              You  can construct your own certificate authority certificate and private key by using a
              command such as:

              openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout ca.key -out ca.crt

              Then edit your openssl.cnf file and edit the certificate variable to point to  your  new
              root certificate ca.crt.

              For  testing  purposes  only,  the OpenVPN distribution includes a sample CA certificate
              (ca.crt).  Of course you should never use the test certificates and test  keys  distrib‐
              uted with OpenVPN in a production environment, since by virtue of the fact that they are
              distributed with OpenVPN, they are totally insecure.

       --capath dir
              Directory containing trusted certificates (CAs and CRLs).  Not available with mbed TLS.

              When using the --capath option, you are required to supply valid CRLs for the  CAs  too.
              CAs  in  the capath directory are expected to be named <hash>.<n>.  CRLs are expected to
              be named <hash>.r<n>.  See the -CApath option of openssl verify , and the  -hash  option
              of openssl x509 and openssl crl for more information.

       --dh file
              File  containing  Diffie  Hellman  parameters  in .pem format (required for --tls-server
              only).

              Set file=none to disable Diffie Hellman key exchange (and use ECDH only). Note that this
              requires  peers  to  be  using an SSL library that supports ECDH TLS cipher suites (e.g.
              OpenSSL 1.0.1+, or mbed TLS 2.0+).

              Use openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048 to  generate  2048-bit  DH  parameters.  Diffie
              Hellman parameters may be considered public.

       --ecdh-curve name
              Specify  the  curve  to  use  for elliptic curve Diffie Hellman. Available curves can be
              listed with --show-curves.  The specified curve will only be used for ECDH TLS-ciphers.

              This option is not supported in mbed TLS builds of OpenVPN.

       --cert file
              Local peer's signed certificate in .pem format -- must be signed by  a  certificate  au‐
              thority  whose certificate is in --ca file.  Each peer in an OpenVPN link running in TLS
              mode should have its own certificate and private key file.  In addition,  each  certifi‐
              cate  should have been signed by the key of a certificate authority whose public key re‐
              sides in the --ca certificate authority file.  You can easily make your own  certificate
              authority  (see  above)  or pay money to use a commercial service such as thawte.com (in
              which case you will be helping to finance the world's second space tourist :).  To  gen‐
              erate a certificate, you can use a command such as:

              openssl req -nodes -new -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.csr

              If your certificate authority private key lives on another machine, copy the certificate
              signing request (mycert.csr) to this other machine (this can be done  over  an  insecure
              channel such as email).  Now sign the certificate with a command such as:

              openssl ca -out mycert.crt -in mycert.csr

              Now  copy  the  certificate  (mycert.crt) back to the peer which initially generated the
              .csr file (this can be over a public medium).  Note that the openssl  ca  command  reads
              the  location  of  the  certificate  authority  key  from its configuration file such as
              /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf -- note also that for certificate  authority  functions,  you
              must set up the files index.txt (may be empty) and serial (initialize to 01 ).

       --extra-certs file
              Specify  a  file  containing one or more PEM certs (concatenated together) that complete
              the local certificate chain.

              This option is useful for "split" CAs, where the CA for server certs is  different  than
              the  CA for client certs.  Putting certs in this file allows them to be used to complete
              the local certificate chain without trusting them to verify the peer-submitted  certifi‐
              cate, as would be the case if the certs were placed in the ca file.

       --key file
              Local  peer's  private key in .pem format.  Use the private key which was generated when
              you built your peer's certificate (see --cert file above).

       --tls-version-min version ['or-highest']
              Sets the minimum TLS version we will accept from the peer (default is "1.0").   Examples
              for version include "1.0", "1.1", or "1.2".  If 'or-highest' is specified and version is
              not recognized, we will only accept the highest TLS version supported by the  local  SSL
              implementation.

       --tls-version-max version
              Set the maximum TLS version we will use (default is the highest version supported).  Ex‐
              amples for version include "1.0", "1.1", or "1.2".

       --pkcs12 file
              Specify a PKCS #12 file containing local private key, local  certificate,  and  root  CA
              certificate.  This option can be used instead of --ca, --cert, and --key.  Not available
              with mbed TLS.

       --verify-hash hash [algo]
              Specify SHA1 or SHA256 fingerprint for level-1 cert.  The level-1 cert is the CA (or in‐
              termediate  cert) that signs the leaf certificate, and is one removed from the leaf cer‐
              tificate in the direction of the root.  When accepting a connection  from  a  peer,  the
              level-1 cert fingerprint must match hash or certificate verification will fail.  Hash is
              specified as XX:XX:... For example:

                  AD:B0:95:D8:09:C8:36:45:12:A9:89:C8:90:09:CB:13:72:A6:AD:16

              The algo flag can be either SHA1 or SHA256.  If not provided, it defaults to SHA1.

       --pkcs11-cert-private [0|1]...
              Set if access to certificate object should be performed after login.  Every provider has
              its own setting.

       --pkcs11-id name
              Specify the serialized certificate id to be used. The id can be gotten by the standalone
              --show-pkcs11-ids option.

       --pkcs11-id-management
              Acquire PKCS#11 id from management interface. In this  case  a  NEED-STR  'pkcs11-id-re‐
              quest'  real-time message will be triggered, application may use pkcs11-id-count command
              to retrieve available number of certificates, and pkcs11-id-get command to retrieve cer‐
              tificate id and certificate body.

       --pkcs11-pin-cache seconds
              Specify  how  many  seconds the PIN can be cached, the default is until the token is re‐
              moved.

       --pkcs11-protected-authentication [0|1]...
              Use PKCS#11 protected authentication path, useful for biometric and external keypad  de‐
              vices.  Every provider has its own setting.

       --pkcs11-providers provider...
              Specify  a RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki) providers
              to load.  This option can be used instead of --cert, --key, and --pkcs12.

              If p11-kit is present on the system, its p11-kit-proxy.so module will be loaded  by  de‐
              fault  if either the --pkcs11-id or --pkcs11-id-management options are specified without
              --pkcs11-provider being given.

       --pkcs11-private-mode mode...
              Specify which method to use in order to perform private  key  operations.   A  different
              mode  can  be  specified for each provider.  Mode is encoded as hex number, and can be a
              mask one of the following:

              0 (default) -- Try to determine automatically.
              1 -- Use sign.
              2 -- Use sign recover.
              4 -- Use decrypt.
              8 -- Use unwrap.

       --cryptoapicert select-string
              Load the certificate and private key from the Windows  Certificate  System  Store  (Win‐
              dows/OpenSSL Only).

              Use this option instead of --cert and --key.

              This makes it possible to use any smart card, supported by Windows, but also any kind of
              certificate, residing in the Cert Store, where you have access to the private key.  This
              option  has been tested with a couple of different smart cards (GemSAFE, Cryptoflex, and
              Swedish Post Office eID) on the client side, and also an imported PKCS12  software  cer‐
              tificate on the server side.

              To select a certificate, based on a substring search in the certificate's subject:

              cryptoapicert "SUBJ:Peter Runestig"

              To select a certificate, based on certificate's thumbprint:

              cryptoapicert "THUMB:f6 49 24 41 01 b4 ..."

              The  thumbprint  hex  string  can easily be copy-and-pasted from the Windows Certificate
              Store GUI.

       --key-method m
              DEPRECATED This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5

              Use data channel key negotiation method m.  The key method must match on both  sides  of
              the connection.

              After OpenVPN negotiates a TLS session, a new set of keys for protecting the tunnel data
              channel is generated and exchanged over the TLS session.

              In method 1 (the default for OpenVPN  1.x),  both  sides  generate  random  encrypt  and
              HMAC-send  keys  which are forwarded to the other host over the TLS channel. Method 1 is
              deprecated in OpenVPN 2.4 , and will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.

              In method 2, (the default for OpenVPN 2.0) the client  generates  a  random  key.   Both
              client  and  server also generate some random seed material.  All key source material is
              exchanged over the TLS channel. The actual keys are generated using the  TLS  PRF  func‐
              tion,  taking  source  entropy  from  both  client  and server.  Method 2 is designed to
              closely parallel the key generation process used by TLS 1.0.

              Note that in TLS mode, two separate levels of keying occur:

              (1) The TLS connection is initially negotiated, with both sides of the  connection  pro‐
              ducing  certificates  and  verifying  the certificate (or other authentication info pro‐
              vided) of the other side.  The --key-method parameter has no effect on this process.

              (2) After the TLS connection is established, the tunnel session keys are separately  ne‐
              gotiated  over the existing secure TLS channel.  Here, --key-method determines the deri‐
              vation of the tunnel session keys.

       --tls-cipher l
       --tls-ciphersuites l
              A list l of allowable TLS ciphers delimited by a colon (":").

              These setting can be used to ensure that certain cipher suites are used  (or  not  used)
              for  the TLS connection.  OpenVPN uses TLS to secure the control channel, over which the
              keys that are used to protect the actual VPN traffic are exchanged.

              The supplied list of ciphers is (after potential OpenSSL/IANA name  translation)  simply
              supplied  to  the  crypto library.  Please see the OpenSSL and/or mbed TLS documentation
              for details on the cipher list interpretation.

              For OpenSSL, the --tls-cipher is used for TLS 1.2 and below. For TLS  1.3  and  up,  the
              --tls-ciphersuites  setting  is  used.  mbed TLS has no TLS 1.3 support yet and only the
              --tls-cipher setting is used.

              Use --show-tls to see a list of TLS ciphers supported by your crypto library.

              Warning!  --tls-cipher and --tls-ciphersuites are expert features, which - if used  cor‐
              recly  - can improve the security of your VPN connection.  But it is also easy to unwit‐
              tingly use them to carefully align a gun with your foot, or just break your  connection.
              Use with care!

              The  default  for  --tls-cipher is to use mbed TLS's default cipher list when using mbed
              TLS or "DEFAULT:!EXP:!LOW:!MEDIUM:!kDH:!kECDH:!DSS:!PSK:!SRP:!kRSA" when using OpenSSL.

              The default for --tls-ciphersuites is to use the crypto library's default.

       --tls-cert-profile profile
              Set the allowed cryptographic algorithms for certificates according to profile.

              The following profiles are supported:

              legacy (default): SHA1 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.

              preferred : SHA2 and newer, RSA 2048-bit+, any elliptic curve.

              suiteb : SHA256/SHA384, ECDSA with P-256 or P-384.

              This option is only fully supported for mbed TLS builds.  OpenSSL builds use the follow‐
              ing approximation:

              legacy (default): sets "security level 1"

              preferred : sets "security level 2"

              suiteb : sets "security level 3" and --tls-cipher "SUITEB128".

              OpenVPN  will  migrate to 'preferred' as default in the future.  Please ensure that your
              keys already comply.

       --tls-timeout n
              Packet retransmit timeout on TLS control channel if no acknowledgment from remote within
              n  seconds (default=2).  When OpenVPN sends a control packet to its peer, it will expect
              to receive an acknowledgement within n seconds or it will retransmit the packet, subject
              to  a  TCP-like  exponential  backoff algorithm.  This parameter only applies to control
              channel packets.  Data channel packets (which carry encrypted tunnel data) are never ac‐
              knowledged, sequenced, or retransmitted by OpenVPN because the higher level network pro‐
              tocols running on top of the tunnel such as TCP expect this role to be left to them.

       --reneg-bytes n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n bytes sent or received (disabled by default with an
              exception, see below).  OpenVPN allows the lifetime of a key to be expressed as a number
              of bytes encrypted/decrypted, a number of packets, or a number of seconds.  A key  rene‐
              gotiation will be forced if any of these three criteria are met by either peer.

              If  using  ciphers  with  cipher block sizes less than 128-bits, --reneg-bytes is set to
              64MB by default, unless it is explicitly disabled by setting the value to 0, but this is
              HIGHLY DISCOURAGED as this is designed to add some protection against the SWEET32 attack
              vector.  For more information see the --cipher option.

       --reneg-pkts n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n packets sent and received (disabled by default).

       --reneg-sec n
              Renegotiate data channel key after n seconds (default=3600).

              When using dual-factor authentication, note that this default value may  cause  the  end
              user to be challenged to reauthorize once per hour.

              Also,  keep  in  mind  that  this  option can be used on both the client and server, and
              whichever uses the lower value will be the one to trigger the renegotiation.   A  common
              mistake  is  to  set --reneg-sec to a higher value on either the client or server, while
              the other side of the connection is still using the default value of 3600 seconds, mean‐
              ing  that  the renegotiation will still occur once per 3600 seconds.  The solution is to
              increase --reneg-sec on both the client and server, or set it to 0 on one  side  of  the
              connection (to disable), and to your chosen value on the other side.

       --hand-window n
              Handshake  Window  -- the TLS-based key exchange must finalize within n seconds of hand‐
              shake initiation by any peer (default = 60 seconds).  If the handshake fails we will at‐
              tempt  to  reset our connection with our peer and try again.  Even in the event of hand‐
              shake failure we will still use our expiring key for  up  to  --tran-window  seconds  to
              maintain continuity of transmission of tunnel data.

       --tran-window n
              Transition window -- our old key can live this many seconds after a new a key renegotia‐
              tion begins (default = 3600 seconds).  This feature allows  for  a  graceful  transition
              from  old  to new key, and removes the key renegotiation sequence from the critical path
              of tunnel data forwarding.

       --single-session
              After initially connecting to a remote peer, disallow any new connections.   Using  this
              option means that a remote peer cannot connect, disconnect, and then reconnect.

              If the daemon is reset by a signal or --ping-restart, it will allow one new connection.

              --single-session  can  be used with --ping-exit or --inactive to create a single dynamic
              session that will exit when finished.

       --tls-exit
              Exit on TLS negotiation failure.

       --tls-auth file [direction]
              Add an additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS control channel to mit‐
              igate DoS attacks and attacks on the TLS stack.

              In  a  nutshell, --tls-auth enables a kind of "HMAC firewall" on OpenVPN's TCP/UDP port,
              where TLS control channel packets bearing an incorrect HMAC signature can be dropped im‐
              mediately without response.

              file  (required)  is  a  file  in  OpenVPN  static  key format which can be generated by
              --genkey

              Older versions (up to OpenVPN 2.3) supported a freeform passphrase  file.   This  is  no
              longer supported in newer versions (v2.4+).

              See the --secret option for more information on the optional direction parameter.

              --tls-auth  is  recommended when you are running OpenVPN in a mode where it is listening
              for packets from any IP address, such as when --remote is not specified, or --remote  is
              specified with --float.

              The  rationale for this feature is as follows.  TLS requires a multi-packet exchange be‐
              fore it is able to authenticate a peer.  During this time before authentication, OpenVPN
              is  allocating resources (memory and CPU) to this potential peer.  The potential peer is
              also exposing many parts of OpenVPN and the OpenSSL library to the packets it  is  send‐
              ing.   Most  successful  network  attacks  today seek to either exploit bugs in programs
              (such as buffer overflow attacks) or force a program to consume so many  resources  that
              it  becomes  unusable.   Of course the first line of defense is always to produce clean,
              well-audited code.  OpenVPN has been written with buffer overflow attack prevention as a
              top  priority.   But as history has shown, many of the most widely used network applica‐
              tions have, from time to time, fallen to buffer overflow attacks.

              So as a second line of defense, OpenVPN offers this special layer of  authentication  on
              top  of the TLS control channel so that every packet on the control channel is authenti‐
              cated by an HMAC signature and a unique ID for replay protection.  This  signature  will
              also  help  protect against DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  An important rule of thumb
              in reducing vulnerability to DoS attacks is to minimize the amount of resources a poten‐
              tial, but as yet unauthenticated, client is able to consume.

              --tls-auth does this by signing every TLS control channel packet with an HMAC signature,
              including packets which are sent before the TLS level has had a chance  to  authenticate
              the peer.  The result is that packets without the correct signature can be dropped imme‐
              diately upon reception, before they have a chance to consume additional system resources
              such  as  by  initiating  a TLS handshake.  --tls-auth can be strengthened by adding the
              --replay-persist option which will keep OpenVPN's replay protection state in a  file  so
              that it is not lost across restarts.

              It  should  be  emphasized that this feature is optional and that the key file used with
              --tls-auth gives a peer nothing more than the power to initiate a TLS handshake.  It  is
              not used to encrypt or authenticate any tunnel data.

              Use  --tls-crypt  instead  if you want to use the key file to not only authenticate, but
              also encrypt the TLS control channel.

       --tls-crypt keyfile

              Encrypt and authenticate all control channel packets with the key  from  keyfile.   (See
              --tls-auth for more background.)

              Encrypting (and authenticating) control channel packets:

              • provides more privacy by hiding the certificate used for the TLS connection,

              • makes it harder to identify OpenVPN traffic as such,

              • provides "poor-man's" post-quantum security, against attackers who will never know the
                pre-shared key (i.e. no forward secrecy).

              In contrast to --tls-auth, --tls-crypt does *not* require the user to  set  --key-direc‐
              tion.

              Security Considerations

              All peers use the same --tls-crypt pre-shared group key to authenticate and encrypt con‐
              trol channel messages.  To ensure that IV collisions remain unlikely,  this  key  should
              not  be used to encrypt more than 2^48 client-to-server or 2^48 server-to-client control
              channel messages.  A typical initial negotiation is about 10 packets in each  direction.
              Assuming  both  initial  negotiation and renegotiations are at most 2^16 (65536) packets
              (to be conservative), and (re)negotiations happen each minute for each user (24/7), this
              limits  the  tls-crypt  key lifetime to 8171 years divided by the number of users.  So a
              setup with 1000 users should rotate the key at least once  each  eight  years.   (And  a
              setup with 8000 users each year.)

              If IV collisions were to occur, this could result in the security of --tls-crypt degrad‐
              ing to the same security as using --tls-auth.  That is, the control channel still  bene‐
              fits from the extra protection against active man-in-the-middle-attacks and DoS attacks,
              but may no longer offer extra privacy and post-quantum security on top of what  TLS  it‐
              self offers.

       --askpass [file]
              Get certificate password from console or file before we daemonize.

              For  the extremely security conscious, it is possible to protect your private key with a
              password.  Of course this means that every time the OpenVPN daemon is started  you  must
              be  there  to  type the password.  The --askpass option allows you to start OpenVPN from
              the command line.  It will query you for a password before it daemonizes.  To protect  a
              private  key  with a password you should omit the -nodes option when you use the openssl
              command line tool to manage certificates and private keys.

              If file is specified, read the password from the first line of file.  Keep in mind  that
              storing  your password in a file to a certain extent invalidates the extra security pro‐
              vided by using an encrypted key.

       --auth-nocache
              Don't cache --askpass or --auth-user-pass username/passwords in virtual memory.

              If specified, this directive will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget  username/password
              inputs  after  they  are  used.  As a result, when OpenVPN needs a username/password, it
              will prompt for input from stdin, which may be multiple times during the duration of  an
              OpenVPN session.

              When  using  --auth-nocache  in  combination  with  a user/password file and --chroot or
              --daemon, make sure to use an absolute path.

              This directive does not affect the --http-proxy username/password.  It is always cached.

       --auth-token token
              This is not an option to be used directly in any configuration files,  but  rather  push
              this  option  from  a  --client-connect  script or a --plugin which hooks into the OPEN‐
              VPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT or OPENVPN_PLUGIN_CLIENT_CONNECT_V2 calls.  This  option  pro‐
              vides  a possibility to replace the clients password with an authentication token during
              the lifetime of the OpenVPN client.

              Whenever the connection  is  renegotiated  and  the  --auth-user-pass-verify  script  or
              --plugin  making  use  of the OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY hook is triggered, it
              will pass over this token as the password instead of the  password  the  user  provided.
              The authentication token can only be reset by a full reconnect where the server can push
              new options to the client.  The password the user entered is never preserved once an au‐
              thentication token have been set.  If the OpenVPN server side rejects the authentication
              token, the client will receive an AUTH_FAIL and disconnect.

              The purpose of this is to enable two factor authentication  methods,  such  as  HOTP  or
              TOTP,  to be used without needing to retrieve a new OTP code each time the connection is
              renegotiated.  Another use case is to cache authentication data on  the  client  without
              needing to have the users password cached in memory during the life time of the session.

              To make use of this feature, the --client-connect script or --plugin needs to put

                  push "auth-token UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE"

              into  the  file/buffer  for dynamic configuration data.  This will then make the OpenVPN
              server to push this value to the client, which replaces  the  local  password  with  the
              UNIQUE_TOKEN_VALUE.

              Newer  clients  (2.4.7+)  will  fall back to the original password method after a failed
              auth. Older clients will keep using the token value and react acording to --auth-retry

       --tls-verify cmd
              Run command cmd to verify the X509 name of a pending TLS connection that  has  otherwise
              passed  all  other tests of certification (except for revocation via --crl-verify direc‐
              tive; the revocation test occurs after the --tls-verify test).

              cmd should return 0 to allow the TLS handshake to proceed, or 1 to fail.

              cmd consists of a path to script (or executable program), optionally followed  by  argu‐
              ments.  The  path  and  arguments may be single- or double-quoted and/or escaped using a
              backslash, and should be separated by one or more spaces.

              When cmd is executed two arguments are appended after any arguments specified in  cmd  ,
              as follows:

              cmd certificate_depth subject

              These  arguments  are,  respectively,  the current certificate depth and the X509 common
              name (cn) of the peer.

              This feature is useful if the peer you want to trust has a certificate which was  signed
              by a certificate authority who also signed many other certificates, where you don't nec‐
              essarily want to trust all of them, but rather be selective about which peer certificate
              you  will  accept.   This  feature allows you to write a script which will test the X509
              name on a certificate and decide whether or not it should be  accepted.   For  a  simple
              perl  script which will test the common name field on the certificate, see the file ver‐
              ify-cn in the OpenVPN distribution.

              See the "Environmental Variables" section below for additional parameters passed as  en‐
              vironmental variables.

       --tls-export-cert directory
              Store  the certificates the clients uses upon connection to this directory. This will be
              done before --tls-verify is called.  The certificates will use a temporary name and will
              be  deleted  when the tls-verify script returns.  The file name used for the certificate
              is available via the peer_cert environment variable.

       --x509-username-field [ext:]fieldname
              Field in the X.509 certificate subject to be used as the username  (default=CN).   Typi‐
              cally, this option is specified with fieldname as either of the following:

              --x509-username-field emailAddress
              --x509-username-field ext:subjectAltName

              The  first  example  uses the value of the "emailAddress" attribute in the certificate's
              Subject field as the username.  The second example uses the ext: prefix to signify  that
              the  X.509  extension  fieldname  "subjectAltName" be searched for an rfc822Name (email)
              field to be used as the username.  In cases where there are multiple email addresses  in
              ext:fieldname, the last occurrence is chosen.

              When  this  option  is used, the --verify-x509-name option will match against the chosen
              fieldname instead of the Common Name.

              Only the subjectAltName and issuerAltName X.509 extensions are supported.

              Please note: This option has a feature which will convert an all-lowercase fieldname  to
              uppercase  characters,  e.g.,  ou  -> OU.  A mixed-case fieldname or one having the ext:
              prefix will be left as-is.  This automatic upcasing feature is deprecated  and  will  be
              removed in a future release.

       --verify-x509-name name type
              Accept  connections  only if a host's X.509 name is equal to name.  The remote host must
              also pass all other tests of verification.

              Which X.509 name is compared to name depends on the setting of type.  type can be  "sub‐
              ject"  to  match  the  complete  subject  DN (default), "name" to match a subject RDN or
              "name-prefix" to match a subject RDN prefix.  Which RDN is verified as name  depends  on
              the  --x509-username-field  option. But it defaults to the common name (CN), e.g. a cer‐
              tificate with a subject DN "C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1" would be matched by:

              --verify-x509-name 'C=KG, ST=NA, L=Bishkek, CN=Server-1' and --verify-x509-name Server-1
              name  or  you  could  use --verify-x509-name Server- name-prefix if you want a client to
              only accept connections to "Server-1", "Server-2", etc.

              --verify-x509-name is a useful replacement for the --tls-verify option to verify the re‐
              mote host, because --verify-x509-name works in a --chroot environment without any depen‐
              dencies.

              Using a name prefix is a useful alternative to managing a  CRL  (Certificate  Revocation
              List)  on  the  client, since it allows the client to refuse all certificates except for
              those associated with designated servers.

              NOTE: Test against a name prefix only when you are using OpenVPN with a custom  CA  cer‐
              tificate that is under your control.  Never use this option with type "name-prefix" when
              your client certificates are signed by a third party, such as a commercial web CA.

       --x509-track attribute
              Save peer X509 attribute value in environment for use by plugins and  management  inter‐
              face.   Prepend  a '+' to attribute to save values from full cert chain.  Values will be
              encoded as X509_<depth>_<attribute>=<value>.  Multiple --x509-track options can  be  de‐
              fined to track multiple attributes.

       --ns-cert-type client|server
              DEPRECATED  This  option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.  Use the more modern equivalent
              --remote-cert-tls instead.  This option will be removed in OpenVPN 2.5.

              Require that peer certificate was signed with  an  explicit  nsCertType  designation  of
              "client" or "server".

              This  is a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the host they connect with
              is a designated server.

              See the easy-rsa/build-key-server script for an example of how to generate a certificate
              with the nsCertType field set to "server".

              If  the  server  certificate's nsCertType field is set to "server", then the clients can
              verify this with --ns-cert-type server.

              This is an important security precaution to protect against a  man-in-the-middle  attack
              where  an  authorized  client attempts to connect to another client by impersonating the
              server.  The attack is easily prevented by having clients verify the server  certificate
              using any one of --ns-cert-type, --verify-x509-name, or --tls-verify.

       --remote-cert-ku [v...]
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit key usage.

              If present in the certificate, the keyUsage value is validated by the TLS library during
              the TLS handshake.  Specifying this option without arguments requires this extension  to
              be present (so the TLS library will verify it).

              If  the list v...  is also supplied, the keyUsage field must have at least the same bits
              set as the bits in one of the values supplied in the list v...

              The key usage values in the list must be encoded in hex, e.g.  "--remote-cert-ku a0"

       --remote-cert-eku oid
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit extended key usage.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the host they connect to is
              a designated server.

              The  extended key usage should be encoded in oid notation, or OpenSSL symbolic represen‐
              tation.

       --remote-cert-tls client|server
              Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit key usage and extended key us‐
              age based on RFC3280 TLS rules.

              This is a useful security option for clients, to ensure that the host they connect to is
              a designated server.  Or the other way around; for a server to verify  that  only  hosts
              with a client certificate can connect.

              The  --remote-cert-tls client option is equivalent to --remote-cert-ku --remote-cert-eku
              "TLS Web Client Authentication"

              The --remote-cert-tls server option is equivalent to --remote-cert-ku  --remote-cert-eku
              "TLS Web Server Authentication"

              This  is  an important security precaution to protect against a man-in-the-middle attack
              where an authorized client attempts to connect to another client  by  impersonating  the
              server.   The attack is easily prevented by having clients verify the server certificate
              using any one of --remote-cert-tls, --verify-x509-name, or --tls-verify.

       --crl-verify crl ['dir']
              Check peer certificate against the file crl in PEM format.

              A CRL (certificate revocation list) is used when a particular  key  is  compromised  but
              when the overall PKI is still intact.

              Suppose  you had a PKI consisting of a CA, root certificate, and a number of client cer‐
              tificates.  Suppose a laptop computer  containing  a  client  key  and  certificate  was
              stolen.   By adding the stolen certificate to the CRL file, you could reject any connec‐
              tion which attempts to use it, while preserving the overall integrity of the PKI.

              The only time when it would be necessary to rebuild the entire PKI from scratch would be
              if the root certificate key itself was compromised.

              If  the optional dir flag is specified, enable a different mode where crl is a directory
              containing files named as revoked serial numbers (the files may be empty,  the  contents
              are never read).  If a client requests a connection, where the client certificate serial
              number (decimal string) is the name of a file present in the directory, it will  be  re‐
              jected.

              Note:  As  the  crl  file  (or directory) is read every time a peer connects, if you are
              dropping root privileges with --user, make sure that this user has sufficient privileges
              to read the file.

   SSL Library information:
       --show-ciphers
              (Standalone) Show all cipher algorithms to use with the --cipher option.

       --show-digests
              (Standalone) Show all message digest algorithms to use with the --auth option.

       --show-tls
              (Standalone)  Show all TLS ciphers supported by the crypto library.  OpenVPN uses TLS to
              secure the control channel, over which the keys that are used to protect the actual  VPN
              traffic are exchanged.  The TLS ciphers will be sorted from highest preference (most se‐
              cure) to lowest.

              Be aware that whether a cipher suite in this list can actually work depends on the  spe‐
              cific  setup of both peers (e.g. both peers must support the cipher, and an ECDSA cipher
              suite will not work if you are using an RSA certificate, etc.).

       --show-engines
              (Standalone) Show currently available hardware-based crypto  acceleration  engines  sup‐
              ported by the OpenSSL library.

       --show-curves
              (Standalone) Show all available elliptic curves to use with the --ecdh-curve option.

   Generate a random key:
       Used only for non-TLS static key encryption mode.

       --genkey
              (Standalone) Generate a random key to be used as a shared secret, for use with the --se‐
              cret option.  This file must be shared with the peer over a pre-existing secure  channel
              such as scp(1)

       --secret file
              Write key to file.

   TUN/TAP persistent tunnel config mode:
       Available  with Linux 2.4.7+.  These options comprise a standalone mode of OpenVPN which can be
       used to create and delete persistent tunnels.

       --mktun
              (Standalone) Create a persistent tunnel on platforms which support them such  as  Linux.
              Normally  TUN/TAP tunnels exist only for the period of time that an application has them
              open.  This option takes advantage of the TUN/TAP driver's ability to  build  persistent
              tunnels  that live through multiple instantiations of OpenVPN and die only when they are
              deleted or the machine is rebooted.

              One of the advantages of persistent tunnels is that they eliminate the need for separate
              --up and --down scripts to run the appropriate ifconfig(8) and route(8) commands.  These
              commands can be placed in the the same shell script which starts or terminates an  Open‐
              VPN session.

              Another  advantage is that open connections through the TUN/TAP-based tunnel will not be
              reset if the OpenVPN peer restarts.  This can be useful to provide uninterrupted connec‐
              tivity  through  the tunnel in the event of a DHCP reset of the peer's public IP address
              (see the --ipchange option above).

              One disadvantage of persistent tunnels is that it is harder to  automatically  configure
              their MTU value (see --link-mtu and --tun-mtu above).

              On some platforms such as Windows, TAP-Win32 tunnels are persistent by default.

       --rmtun
              (Standalone) Remove a persistent tunnel.

       --dev tunX | tapX
              TUN/TAP device

       --user user
              Optional user to be owner of this tunnel.

       --group group
              Optional group to be owner of this tunnel.

   Windows-Specific Options:
       --win-sys path
              Set  the  Windows  system  directory pathname to use when looking for system executables
              such as route.exe and netsh.exe.  By default, if this directive is not specified,  Open‐
              VPN will use the SystemRoot environment variable.

              This  option have changed behaviour in OpenVPN 2.3.  Earlier you had to define --win-sys
              env to use the SystemRoot environment variable, otherwise it  defaulted  to  C:\WINDOWS.
              It is not needed to use the env keyword any more, and it will just be ignored. A warning
              is logged when this is found in the configuration file.

       --ip-win32 method
              When using --ifconfig on Windows, set the TAP-Win32 adapter IP address and netmask using
              method.  Don't use this option unless you are also using --ifconfig.

              manual  --  Don't set the IP address or netmask automatically.  Instead output a message
              to the console telling the user to configure the adapter  manually  and  indicating  the
              IP/netmask which OpenVPN expects the adapter to be set to.

              dynamic  [offset] [lease-time] -- Automatically set the IP address and netmask by reply‐
              ing to DHCP query messages generated by the kernel.  This mode is probably  the  "clean‐
              est" solution for setting the TCP/IP properties since it uses the well-known DHCP proto‐
              col.  There are, however, two prerequisites for using this mode: (1) The TCP/IP  proper‐
              ties  for the TAP-Win32 adapter must be set to "Obtain an IP address automatically," and
              (2) OpenVPN needs to claim an IP address in the subnet  for  use  as  the  virtual  DHCP
              server  address.   By  default  in --dev tap mode, OpenVPN will take the normally unused
              first address in the subnet.   For  example,  if  your  subnet  is  192.168.4.0  netmask
              255.255.255.0,  then  OpenVPN will take the IP address 192.168.4.0 to use as the virtual
              DHCP server address.  In --dev tun mode, OpenVPN will cause the DHCP server to  masquer‐
              ade  as if it were coming from the remote endpoint.  The optional offset parameter is an
              integer which is > -256 and < 256 and which defaults to -1.  If offset is positive,  the
              DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at network address + offset.  If offset is
              negative, the DHCP server will masquerade as the IP address at broadcast address +  off‐
              set.  The Windows ipconfig /all command can be used to show what Windows thinks the DHCP
              server address is.  OpenVPN will "claim" this address, so make sure to use  a  free  ad‐
              dress.   Having said that, different OpenVPN instantiations, including different ends of
              the same connection, can share the same virtual DHCP server address.  The lease-time pa‐
              rameter  controls  the lease time of the DHCP assignment given to the TAP-Win32 adapter,
              and is denoted in seconds.  Normally a very long lease time is preferred because it pre‐
              vents  routes  involving  the  TAP-Win32 adapter from being lost when the system goes to
              sleep.  The default lease time is one year.

              netsh -- Automatically set the IP address and netmask  using  the  Windows  command-line
              "netsh"  command.   This  method appears to work correctly on Windows XP but not Windows
              2000.

              ipapi -- Automatically set the IP address and netmask using the Windows IP  Helper  API.
              This  approach does not have ideal semantics, though testing has indicated that it works
              okay in practice.  If you use this option, it is best to leave the TCP/IP properties for
              the TAP-Win32 adapter in their default state, i.e. "Obtain an IP address automatically."

              adaptive  --  (Default)  Try dynamic method initially and fail over to netsh if the DHCP
              negotiation with the TAP-Win32 adapter does not succeed in 20  seconds.   Such  failures
              have  been  known  to  occur when certain third-party firewall packages installed on the
              client machine block the DHCP negotiation used by the TAP-Win32 adapter.  Note  that  if
              the  netsh  failover  occurs, the TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties will be reset from
              DHCP to static, and this will cause future OpenVPN startups using the adaptive  mode  to
              use netsh immediately, rather than trying dynamic first.  To "unstick" the adaptive mode
              from using netsh, run OpenVPN at least once  using  the  dynamic  mode  to  restore  the
              TAP-Win32 adapter TCP/IP properties to a DHCP configuration.

       --route-method m
              Which method m to use for adding routes on Windows?

              adaptive  (default)  --  Try  IP  helper  API  first.   If  that fails, fall back to the
              route.exe shell command.
              ipapi -- Use IP helper API.
              exe -- Call the route.exe shell command.

       --dhcp-option type [parm]
              Set extended TAP-Win32 TCP/IP properties,  must  be  used  with  --ip-win32  dynamic  or
              --ip-win32 adaptive.  This option can be used to set additional TCP/IP properties on the
              TAP-Win32 adapter, and is particularly useful for configuring an OpenVPN client  to  ac‐
              cess a Samba server across the VPN.

              DOMAIN name -- Set Connection-specific DNS Suffix.

              DNS  addr -- Set primary domain name server IPv4 or IPv6 address.  Repeat this option to
              set secondary DNS server addresses.

              Note: DNS IPv6 servers are currently set using netsh (the existing DHCP code can only do
              IPv4  DHCP, and that protocol only permits IPv4 addresses anywhere).  The option will be
              put into the environment, so an --up script could act upon it if needed.

              WINS addr -- Set primary WINS server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Name Server).   Repeat
              this option to set secondary WINS server addresses.

              NBDD  addr -- Set primary NBDD server address (NetBIOS over TCP/IP Datagram Distribution
              Server) Repeat this option to set secondary NBDD server addresses.

              NTP addr -- Set primary NTP server address (Network Time Protocol).  Repeat this  option
              to set secondary NTP server addresses.

              NBT  type  --  Set  NetBIOS over TCP/IP Node type.  Possible options: 1 = b-node (broad‐
              casts), 2 = p-node (point-to-point name queries to a WINS server), 4 = m-node (broadcast
              then query name server), and 8 = h-node (query name server, then broadcast).

              NBS  scope-id  -- Set NetBIOS over TCP/IP Scope. A NetBIOS Scope ID provides an extended
              naming service for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (Known as NBT) module. The primary purpose of
              a NetBIOS scope ID is to isolate NetBIOS traffic on a single network to only those nodes
              with the same NetBIOS scope ID.  The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string that is  ap‐
              pended  to  the  NetBIOS  name. The NetBIOS scope ID on two hosts must match, or the two
              hosts will not be able to communicate. The NetBIOS Scope ID also allows computers to use
              the same computer name, as they have different scope IDs. The Scope ID becomes a part of
              the NetBIOS name, making the name unique.  (This description of NetBIOS scopes  courtesy
              of NeonSurge@abyss.com)

              DISABLE-NBT -- Disable Netbios-over-TCP/IP.

              Note that if --dhcp-option is pushed via --push to a non-windows client, the option will
              be saved in the client's environment before the up script  is  called,  under  the  name
              "foreign_option_{n}".

       --tap-sleep n
              Cause  OpenVPN  to  sleep for n seconds immediately after the TAP-Win32 adapter state is
              set to "connected".

              This option is intended to be used to troubleshoot  problems  with  the  --ifconfig  and
              --ip-win32  options,  and  is  used to give the TAP-Win32 adapter time to come up before
              Windows IP Helper API operations are applied to it.

       --show-net-up
              Output OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list to the syslog
              or  log  file  after  the  TUN/TAP  adapter has been brought up and any routes have been
              added.

       --block-outside-dns
              Block DNS servers on other network adapters to prevent DNS leaks. This  option  prevents
              any  application from accessing TCP or UDP port 53 except one inside the tunnel. It uses
              Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and works on Windows Vista or later.

              This option is considered unknown on non-Windows platforms and  unsupported  on  Windows
              XP,  resulting in fatal error.  You may want to use --setenv opt or --ignore-unknown-op‐
              tion (not suitable for Windows XP) to ignore said error.  Note that pushing unknown  op‐
              tions from server does not trigger fatal errors.

       --dhcp-renew
              Ask Windows to renew the TAP adapter lease on startup.  This option is normally unneces‐
              sary, as Windows automatically triggers a DHCP renegotiation on the TAP adapter when  it
              comes up, however if you set the TAP-Win32 adapter Media Status property to "Always Con‐
              nected", you may need this flag.

       --dhcp-release
              Ask Windows to release the TAP adapter lease on shutdown.  This  option  has  no  effect
              now, as it is enabled by default starting with OpenVPN 2.4.1.

       --register-dns
              Run  ipconfig  /flushdns  and  ipconfig  /registerdns on connection initiation.  This is
              known to kick Windows into recognizing pushed DNS servers.

       --pause-exit
              Put up a "press any key to continue" message on the console  prior  to  OpenVPN  program
              exit.   This option is automatically used by the Windows explorer when OpenVPN is run on
              a configuration file using the right-click explorer menu.

       --service exit-event [0|1]
              Should be used when OpenVPN is being automatically executed by another program in such a
              context  that no interaction with the user via display or keyboard is possible.  In gen‐
              eral, end-users should never need to explicitly use this option, as it is  automatically
              added  by the OpenVPN service wrapper when a given OpenVPN configuration is being run as
              a service.

              exit-event is the name of a Windows global event object, and OpenVPN  will  continuously
              monitor the state of this event object and exit when it becomes signaled.

              The  second parameter indicates the initial state of exit-event and normally defaults to
              0.

              Multiple OpenVPN processes can be simultaneously executed with the same  exit-event  pa‐
              rameter.   In  any case, the controlling process can signal exit-event, causing all such
              OpenVPN processes to exit.

              When executing an OpenVPN process using the --service directive, OpenVPN  will  probably
              not have a console window to output status/error messages, therefore it is useful to use
              --log or --log-append to write these messages to a file.

       --show-adapters
              (Standalone)  Show  available  TAP-Win32  adapters  which  can  be  selected  using  the
              --dev-node  option.   On  non-Windows  systems, the ifconfig(8) command provides similar
              functionality.

       --allow-nonadmin [TAP-adapter]
              (Standalone) Set TAP-adapter to  allow  access  from  non-administrative  accounts.   If
              TAP-adapter  is  omitted,  all  TAP  adapters  on the system will be configured to allow
              non-admin access.  The non-admin access setting will only persist for the length of time
              that  the  TAP-Win32  device object and driver remain loaded, and will need to be re-en‐
              abled after a reboot, or if the driver is unloaded and  reloaded.   This  directive  can
              only be used by an administrator.

       --show-valid-subnets
              (Standalone) Show valid subnets for --dev tun emulation.  Since the TAP-Win32 driver ex‐
              ports an ethernet interface to Windows, and since TUN devices are point-to-point in  na‐
              ture, it is necessary for the TAP-Win32 driver to impose certain constraints on TUN end‐
              point address selection.

              Namely, the point-to-point endpoints used in TUN device emulation must be the middle two
              addresses of a /30 subnet (netmask 255.255.255.252).

       --show-net
              (Standalone) Show OpenVPN's view of the system routing table and network adapter list.

   PKCS#11 Standalone Options:
       --show-pkcs11-ids [provider] [cert_private]
              (Standalone)  Show  PKCS#11 token object list. Specify cert_private as 1 if certificates
              are stored as private objects.

              If p11-kit is present on the system, the provider argument is optional; if  omitted  the
              default p11-kit-proxy.so module will be queried.

              --verb option can be used BEFORE this option to produce debugging information.

   Standalone Debug Options:
       --show-gateway [v6target]
              (Standalone)  Show current IPv4 and IPv6 default gateway and interface towards the gate‐
              way (if the protocol in question is enabled).  If an IPv6 address is passed as argument,
              the IPv6 route for this host is reported.

   IPv6 Related Options
       The  following  options exist to support IPv6 tunneling in peer-to-peer and client-server mode.
       All options are modeled after their IPv4 counterparts,  so  more  detailed  explanations  given
       there apply here as well (except for --topology , which has no effect on IPv6).

       --ifconfig-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote
              configure  IPv6  address  ipv6addr/bits  on the ``tun'' device.  The second parameter is
              used as route target for --route-ipv6 if no gateway is specified.

       --route-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits [gateway] [metric]
              setup IPv6 routing in the system to send  the  specified  IPv6  network  into  OpenVPN's
              ``tun''.  The gateway parameter is only used for IPv6 routes across ``tap'' devices, and
              if missing, the ``ipv6remote'' field from --ifconfig-ipv6 is used.

       --server-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
              convenience-function to enable a number of IPv6 related options at once, namely --ifcon‐
              fig-ipv6, --ifconfig-ipv6-pool and --push tun-ipv6 Is only accepted if ``--mode server''
              or ``--server'' is set. Pushing of the --tun-ipv6 directive is done  for  older  clients
              which require an explicit ``--tun-ipv6'' in their configuration.

       --ifconfig-ipv6-pool ipv6addr/bits
              Specify  an  IPv6  address  pool  for dynamic assignment to clients.  The pool starts at
              ipv6addr and matches the offset determined from the start of the IPv4 pool.

       --ifconfig-ipv6-push ipv6addr/bits ipv6remote
              for ccd/ per-client static IPv6 interface  configuration,  see  --client-config-dir  and
              --ifconfig-push for more details.

       --iroute-ipv6 ipv6addr/bits
              for  ccd/  per-client static IPv6 route configuration, see --iroute for more details how
              to setup and use this, and how --iroute and --route interact.

SCRIPTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES
       OpenVPN exports a series of environmental variables for use by user-defined scripts.

   Script Order of Execution
       --up   Executed after TCP/UDP socket bind and TUN/TAP open.

       --tls-verify
              Executed when we have a still untrusted remote peer.

       --ipchange
              Executed after connection authentication, or remote IP address change.

       --client-connect
              Executed in --mode server mode immediately after client authentication.

       --route-up
              Executed after connection authentication, either immediately after, or  some  number  of
              seconds after as defined by the --route-delay option.

       --route-pre-down
              Executed right before the routes are removed.

       --client-disconnect
              Executed in --mode server mode on client instance shutdown.

       --down Executed after TCP/UDP and TUN/TAP close.

       --learn-address
              Executed in --mode server mode whenever an IPv4 address/route or MAC address is added to
              OpenVPN's internal routing table.

       --auth-user-pass-verify
              Executed in --mode server mode on new client connections, when the client is  still  un‐
              trusted.

   String Types and Remapping
       In  certain  cases,  OpenVPN will perform remapping of characters in strings.  Essentially, any
       characters outside the set of permitted characters for each string type will  be  converted  to
       underbar ('_').

       Q: Why is string remapping necessary?

       A: It's an important security feature to prevent the malicious coding of strings from untrusted
       sources to be passed as parameters to scripts, saved in the environment, used as a common name,
       translated to a filename, etc.

       Q: Can string remapping be disabled?

       A:  Yes, by using the --no-name-remapping option, however this should be considered an advanced
       option.

       Here is a brief rundown of OpenVPN's current string types and the permitted character class for
       each string:

       X509  Names:  Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), at ('@'), colon (':'), slash
       ('/'), and equal ('=').  Alphanumeric is defined as a character which will cause the C  library
       isalnum() function to return true.

       Common Names: Alphanumeric, underbar ('_'), dash ('-'), dot ('.'), and at ('@').

       --auth-user-pass  username:  Same  as  Common  Name,  with one exception: starting with OpenVPN
       2.0.1, the username is passed to the OPENVPN_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY  plugin  in  its  raw
       form, without string remapping.

       --auth-user-pass  password: Any "printable" character except CR or LF.  Printable is defined to
       be a character which will cause the C library isprint() function to return true.

       --client-config-dir filename as derived from common name or  username:  Alphanumeric,  underbar
       ('_'),  dash  ('-'),  and  dot  ('.')  except  for  "."  or  ".." as standalone strings.  As of
       v2.0.1-rc6, the at ('@') character has been added as well for  compatibility  with  the  common
       name character class.

       Environmental variable names: Alphanumeric or underbar ('_').

       Environmental variable values: Any printable character.

       For  all  cases,  characters in a string which are not members of the legal character class for
       that string type will be remapped to underbar ('_').

   Environmental Variables
       Once set, a variable is persisted indefinitely until it is reset by a new value or a restart,

       As of OpenVPN 2.0-beta12, in server mode, environmental variables set by OpenVPN are scoped ac‐
       cording  to the client objects they are associated with, so there should not be any issues with
       scripts having access to stale, previously set variables which refer to  different  client  in‐
       stances.

       bytes_received
              Total  number  of bytes received from client during VPN session.  Set prior to execution
              of the --client-disconnect script.

       bytes_sent
              Total number of bytes sent to client during VPN session.  Set prior to execution of  the
              --client-disconnect script.

       common_name
              The   X509  common  name  of  an  authenticated  client.   Set  prior  to  execution  of
              --client-connect, --client-disconnect, and --auth-user-pass-verify scripts.

       config Name of first --config file.  Set on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       daemon Set to "1" if the --daemon directive is specified, or "0"  otherwise.   Set  on  program
              initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       daemon_log_redirect
              Set to "1" if the --log or --log-append directives are specified, or "0" otherwise.  Set
              on program initiation and reset on SIGHUP.

       dev_idx
              On Windows, the device index of the TUN/TAP adapter (to be used in netsh.exe calls which
              sometimes just do not work right with interface names).  Set prior  to  --up  or  --down
              script execution.

       foreign_option_{n}
              An  option  pushed  via  --push  to a client which does not natively support it, such as

              rameter  of the IPv6 address in the --ifconfig-ipv6 option (first parameter).  Set prior
              to OpenVPN calling the ifconfig or netsh (windows version of  ifconfig)  commands  which
              normally occurs prior to --up script execution.

       ifconfig_ipv6_remote

              ter to --ifconfig when --dev tap is being used.  Set prior to OpenVPN calling the ifcon‐
              fig  or netsh (windows version of ifconfig) commands which normally occurs prior to --up
              script execution.

       ifconfig_pool_local_ip
              The local virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an --ifconfig-push direc‐
              tive  if  specified,  or  otherwise  from  the ifconfig pool (controlled by the --ifcon‐
              fig-pool config file directive).  Only set for --dev tun tunnels.  This option is set on

              prior to execution of the --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts.

       ifconfig_pool_remote_ip
              The remote virtual IP address for the TUN/TAP tunnel taken from an  --ifconfig-push  di‐
              rective  if  specified,  or otherwise from the ifconfig pool (controlled by the --ifcon‐
              fig-pool config file directive).  This option is set on the server prior to execution of
              the --client-connect and --client-disconnect scripts.

       link_mtu
              The  maximum  packet  size  (not  including  the IP header) of tunnel data in UDP tunnel
              transport mode.  Set prior to --up or --down script execution.

              script execution.

       route_vpn_gateway
              The  default gateway used by --route options, as specified in either the --route-gateway
              option or the second parameter to --ifconfig when --dev tun is specified.  Set prior  to
              --up script execution.

       route_{parm}_{n}
              A set of variables which define each route to be added, and are set prior to --up script
              execution.

              parm will be one of "network", "netmask", "gateway", or "metric".

              n is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.

              If the network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address  translations  will
              be  recorded  rather  than  their  names as denoted on the command line or configuration
              file.

       route_ipv6_{parm}_{n}
              A set of variables which define each IPv6 route to be added, and are set prior  to  --up
              script execution.

              parm  will  be  one  of  "network" or "gateway" ("netmask" is contained as "/nnn" in the
              route_ipv6_network_{n}, unlike IPv4 where it is passed in a separate  environment  vari‐
              able).

              n is the OpenVPN route number, starting from 1.

              If  the  network or gateway are resolvable DNS names, their IP address translations will
              be recorded rather than their names as denoted on  the  command  line  or  configuration
              file.

       peer_cert
              Temporary  file  name containing the client certificate upon connection.  Useful in con‐
              junction with --tls-verify

       script_context
              Set to "init" or "restart" prior to up/down script execution.  For more information, see
              documentation for --up.

       script_type
              Prior  to execution of any script, this variable is set to the type of script being run.
              It  can  be  one  of  the  following:  up,   down,   ipchange,   route-up,   tls-verify,
              auth-user-pass-verify,  client-connect,  client-disconnect, or learn-address.  Set prior
              to execution of any script.

       signal The reason for exit or restart.  Can be one of sigusr1, sighup, sigterm,  sigint,  inac‐
              tive  (controlled  by  --inactive option), ping-exit (controlled by --ping-exit option),
              ping-restart (controlled by --ping-restart option), connection-reset (triggered  on  TCP
              connection  reset), error, or unknown (unknown signal).  This variable is set just prior
              to down script execution.

       time_ascii
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a human-readable time string.   Set  prior  to
              execution of the --client-connect script.

       time_duration
              The  duration  (in seconds) of the client session which is now disconnecting.  Set prior
              to execution of the --client-disconnect script.

       time_unix
              Client connection timestamp, formatted as a unix integer date/time value.  Set prior  to
              execution of the --client-connect script.

       tls_digest_{n} / tls_digest_sha256_{n}
              Contains  the  certificate SHA1 / SHA256 fingerprint, where n is the verification level.
              Only set for TLS connections.  Set prior to execution of --tls-verify script.

       tls_id_{n}
              A series of certificate fields from the remote peer, where n is the verification  level.
              Only set for TLS connections.  Set prior to execution of --tls-verify script.

       tls_serial_{n}
              The  serial  number of the certificate from the remote peer, where n is the verification
              level.  Only set for TLS connections.  Set prior to execution  of  --tls-verify  script.
              This  is  in  the form of a decimal string like "933971680", which is suitable for doing
              serial-based OCSP queries (with OpenSSL, do not prepend "0x" to the string) If something
              goes  wrong  while reading the value from the certificate it will be an empty string, so
              your code should check that.  See the contrib/OCSP_check/OCSP_check.sh script for an ex‐
              ample.

       tls_serial_hex_{n}
              Like tls_serial_{n}, but in hex form (e.g. "12:34:56:78:9A").

       tun_mtu
              The MTU of the TUN/TAP device.  Set prior to --up or --down script execution.

       trusted_ip (or trusted_ip6)
              Actual  IP address of connecting client or peer which has been authenticated.  Set prior
              to execution of --ipchange, --client-connect, and --client-disconnect scripts.  If using
              ipv6 endpoints (udp6, tcp6), trusted_ip6 will be set instead.

       trusted_port
              Actual port number of connecting client or peer which has been authenticated.  Set prior
              to execution of --ipchange, --client-connect, and --client-disconnect scripts.

       untrusted_ip (or untrusted_ip6)
              Actual IP address of connecting client or peer which has  not  been  authenticated  yet.
              Sometimes  used  to  nmap  the  connecting host in a --tls-verify script to ensure it is
              firewalled properly.  Set prior to execution of --tls-verify and --auth-user-pass-verify
              scripts.  If using ipv6 endpoints (udp6, tcp6), untrusted_ip6 will be set instead.

       untrusted_port
              Actual  port  number  of connecting client or peer which has not been authenticated yet.
              Set prior to execution of --tls-verify and --auth-user-pass-verify scripts.

       username
              The username provided by a connecting  client.   Set  prior  to  --auth-user-pass-verify
              script execution only when the via-env modifier is specified.

       X509_{n}_{subject_field}
              An  X509  subject  field  from  the remote peer certificate, where n is the verification
              level.  Only set for TLS connections.  Set prior to execution  of  --tls-verify  script.
              This variable is similar to tls_id_{n} except the component X509 subject fields are bro‐
              ken out, and no string remapping occurs on these field values (except for  remapping  of
              control  characters  to  "_").  For example, the following variables would be set on the
              OpenVPN server using the sample client certificate in  sample-keys  (client.crt).   Note
              that  the  verification  level is 0 for the client certificate and 1 for the CA certifi‐
              cate.

                  X509_0_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                  X509_0_CN=Test-Client
                  X509_0_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                  X509_0_ST=NA
                  X509_0_C=KG
                  X509_1_emailAddress=me@myhost.mydomain
                  X509_1_O=OpenVPN-TEST
                  X509_1_L=BISHKEK
                  X509_1_ST=NA
                  X509_1_C=KG

INLINE FILE SUPPORT
       OpenVPN allows including files in the main configuration for  the  --ca,  --cert,  --dh,  --ex‐
       tra-certs,  --key,  --pkcs12,  --secret,  --crl-verify,  --http-proxy-user-pass, --tls-auth and
       --tls-crypt options.

       Each inline file started by the line <option> and ended by the line </option>

       Here is an example of an inline file usage

           <cert>
           -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
           [...]
           -----END CERTIFICATE-----
           </cert>

       When using the inline file feature with --pkcs12 the inline file has to be base64 encoded.  En‐
       coding  of  a  .p12  file  into  base64 can be done for example with OpenSSL by running openssl
       base64 -in input.p12

SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Cause OpenVPN to close all TUN/TAP and network connections, restart, re-read the config‐
              uration file (if any), and reopen TUN/TAP and network connections.

       SIGUSR1
              Like  SIGHUP,  except don't re-read configuration file, and possibly don't close and re‐
              open TUN/TAP device, re-read key files, preserve local IP address/port, or preserve most
              recently  authenticated  remote  IP  address/port based on --persist-tun, --persist-key,
              --persist-local-ip, and --persist-remote-ip options respectively (see above).

              This signal may also be internally generated by a timeout  condition,  governed  by  the
              --ping-restart option.

              This signal, when combined with --persist-remote-ip, may be sent when the underlying pa‐
              rameters of the host's network interface change such as when the host is a  DHCP  client
              and is assigned a new IP address.  See --ipchange above for more information.

       SIGUSR2
              Causes  OpenVPN  to  display  its  current statistics (to the syslog file if --daemon is
              used, or stdout otherwise).

       SIGINT, SIGTERM
              Causes OpenVPN to exit gracefully.

TUN/TAP DRIVER SETUP
       If you are running Linux 2.4.7 or higher, you probably have  the  TUN/TAP  driver  already  in‐
       stalled.  If so, there are still a few things you need to do:

       Make device: mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

       Load driver: modprobe tun

EXAMPLES
       Prior to running these examples, you should have OpenVPN installed on two machines with network
       connectivity between them.  If you have not yet installed OpenVPN, consult the INSTALL file in‐
       cluded in the OpenVPN distribution.

   TUN/TAP Setup:
       If you are using Linux 2.4 or higher, make the tun device node and load the tun module:

              mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200

              modprobe tun

       If you installed from RPM, the mknod step may be omitted, because the RPM install does that for
       you.

       Only Linux 2.4 and newer are supported.

       For other platforms, consult the INSTALL file at http://openvpn.net/install.html for  more  in‐
       formation.

   Firewall Setup:
       If  firewalls  exist  between  the two machines, they should be set to forward UDP port 1194 in
       both directions.  If you do not have control over the firewalls between the two  machines,  you
       may still be able to use OpenVPN by adding --ping 15 to each of the openvpn commands used below
       in the examples (this will cause each peer to send out a UDP ping to its remote peer once every
       15 seconds which will cause many stateful firewalls to forward packets in both directions with‐
       out an explicit firewall rule).

       If you are using a Linux iptables-based firewall, you may need to enter the  following  command
       to allow incoming packets on the TUN device:

              iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       See  the  firewalls  section  below  for more information on configuring firewalls for use with
       OpenVPN.

   VPN Address Setup:
       For purposes of our example, our two machines will be called  bob.example.com  and  alice.exam‐
       ple.com.  If you are constructing a VPN over the internet, then replace bob.example.com and al‐
       ice.example.com with the internet hostname or IP address that each machine will use to  contact
       the other over the internet.

       Now  we  will choose the tunnel endpoints.  Tunnel endpoints are private IP addresses that only
       have meaning in the context of the VPN.  Each machine will use the tunnel endpoint of the other
       machine  to  access  it  over the VPN.  In our example, the tunnel endpoint for bob.example.com
       will be 10.4.0.1 and for alice.example.com, 10.4.0.2.

       Once the VPN is established, you have essentially created a secure alternate path  between  the
       two  hosts  which  is  addressed  by using the tunnel endpoints.  You can control which network
       traffic passes between the hosts (a) over the VPN or (b) independently of the VPN, by  choosing
       whether  to  use (a) the VPN endpoint address or (b) the public internet address, to access the
       remote host. For example if you are on bob.example.com and you wish to connect  to  alice.exam‐
       ple.com  via  ssh without using the VPN (since ssh has its own built-in security) you would use
       the command ssh alice.example.com.  However in the same scenario, you could also use  the  com‐
       mand telnet 10.4.0.2 to create a telnet session with alice.example.com over the VPN, that would
       use the VPN to secure the session rather than ssh.

       You can use any address you wish for the tunnel endpoints but make sure that they  are  private
       addresses  (such  as those that begin with 10 or 192.168) and that they are not part of any ex‐
       isting subnet on the networks of either peer, unless you are bridging.  If you use  an  address
       that  is  part  of  your  local subnet for either of the tunnel endpoints, you will get a weird
       feedback loop.

   Example 1: A simple tunnel without security
       On bob:

              openvpn --remote alice.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --verb 9

       On alice:

              openvpn --remote bob.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 9

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On bob:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On alice:

              ping 10.4.0.1

       The --verb 9 option will produce verbose output, similar to the tcpdump(8) program.   Omit  the
       --verb 9 option to have OpenVPN run quietly.

   Example 2: A tunnel with static-key security (i.e. using a pre-shared secret)
       First build a static key on bob.

              openvpn --genkey --secret key

       This  command will build a random key file called key (in ascii format).  Now copy key to alice
       over a secure medium such as by using the scp(1) program.

       On bob:

              openvpn --remote alice.example.com --dev tun1  --ifconfig  10.4.0.1  10.4.0.2  --verb  5
              --secret key

       On alice:

              openvpn  --remote bob.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.2 10.4.0.1 --verb 5 --se‐
              cret key

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On bob:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On alice:

              ping 10.4.0.1

   Example 3: A tunnel with full TLS-based security
       For this test, we will designate bob as the TLS client and alice as the TLS server.  Note  that
       client or server designation only has meaning for the TLS subsystem. It has no bearing on Open‐
       VPN's peer-to-peer, UDP-based communication model.

       First, build a separate certificate/key pair for both bob and alice (see above where --cert  is
       discussed  for  more  info).  Then construct Diffie Hellman parameters (see above where --dh is
       discussed for more info).  You can also use the included  test  files  client.crt,  client.key,
       server.crt, server.key and ca.crt.  The .crt files are certificates/public-keys, the .key files
       are private keys, and ca.crt is a certification authority who has signed  both  client.crt  and
       server.crt.  For Diffie Hellman parameters you can use the included file dh1024.pem.  Note that
       all client, server, and certificate authority certificates and keys  included  in  the  OpenVPN
       distribution are totally insecure and should be used for testing only.

       On bob:

              openvpn  --remote alice.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig 10.4.0.1 10.4.0.2 --tls-client
              --ca ca.crt --cert client.crt --key client.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5

       On alice:

              openvpn --remote bob.example.com --dev tun1 --ifconfig  10.4.0.2  10.4.0.1  --tls-server
              --dh dh1024.pem --ca ca.crt --cert server.crt --key server.key --reneg-sec 60 --verb 5

       Now verify the tunnel is working by pinging across the tunnel.

       On bob:

              ping 10.4.0.2

       On alice:

              ping 10.4.0.1

       Notice  the  --reneg-sec  60  option we used above.  That tells OpenVPN to renegotiate the data
       channel keys every minute.  Since we used --verb 5 above, you will see  status  information  on
       each new key negotiation.

       For production operations, a key renegotiation interval of 60 seconds is probably too frequent.
       Omit the --reneg-sec 60 option to use OpenVPN's default key renegotiation interval of one hour.

   Routing:
       Assuming you can ping across the tunnel, the next step is to route a real subnet over  the  se‐
       cure tunnel.  Suppose that bob and alice have two network interfaces each, one connected to the
       internet, and the other to a private network.  Our goal is to  securely  connect  both  private
       networks.  We will assume that bob's private subnet is 10.0.0.0/24 and alice's is 10.0.1.0/24.

       First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on both peers.  On Linux, enable routing:

              echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

       and enable TUN packet forwarding through the firewall:

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       On bob:

              route add -net 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.2

       On alice:

              route add -net 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.4.0.1

       Now any machine on the 10.0.0.0/24 subnet can access any machine on the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet over
       the secure tunnel (or vice versa).

       In a production environment, you could put the route command(s) in a script  and  execute  with
       the --up option.

FIREWALLS
       OpenVPN's  usage of a single UDP port makes it fairly firewall-friendly.  You should add an en‐
       try to your firewall rules to allow incoming OpenVPN packets.  On Linux 2.4+:

              iptables -A INPUT -p udp -s 1.2.3.4 --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

       This will allow incoming packets on UDP port 1194 (OpenVPN's default UDP port) from an  OpenVPN
       peer at 1.2.3.4.

       If  you  are  using  HMAC-based  packet  authentication (the default in any of OpenVPN's secure
       modes), having the firewall filter on source address can be  considered  optional,  since  HMAC
       packet  authentication  is  a much more secure method of verifying the authenticity of a packet
       source.  In that case:

              iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT

       would be adequate and would not render the host inflexible with respect to its  peer  having  a
       dynamic IP address.

       OpenVPN  also  works  well  on  stateful firewalls.  In some cases, you may not need to add any
       static rules to the firewall list if you are using a stateful firewall that knows how to  track
       UDP  connections.   If you specify --ping n, OpenVPN will be guaranteed to send a packet to its
       peer at least once every n seconds.  If n is less than the stateful firewall  connection  time‐
       out, you can maintain an OpenVPN connection indefinitely without explicit firewall rules.

       You should also add firewall rules to allow incoming IP traffic on TUN or TAP devices such as:

              iptables -A INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tun devices,

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tun devices to be forwarded to other hosts on the local network,

              iptables -A INPUT -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tap devices, and

              iptables -A FORWARD -i tap+ -j ACCEPT

       to allow input packets from tap devices to be forwarded to other hosts on the local network.

       These  rules are secure if you use packet authentication, since no incoming packets will arrive
       on a TUN or TAP virtual device unless they first pass an HMAC authentication test.
