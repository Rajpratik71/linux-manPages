NAME
       shadowconfig - toggle shadow passwords on and off

SYNOPSIS
       shadowconfig on | off

DESCRIPTION
       shadowconfig  on  will  turn  shadow  passwords on; shadowconfig off will turn shadow passwords off. shadowconfig will print an error message and exit with a nonzero code if it finds anything
       awry. If that happens, you should correct the error and run it again. Turning shadow passwords on when they are already on, or off when they are already off, is harmless.

       Read /usr/share/doc/passwd/README.Debian for a brief introduction to shadow passwords and related features.

       Note that turning shadow passwords off and on again will lose all password aging information.
