ENVIRONMENT
       xfdesktop's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              Specifies the root for all user-specific configuration files.  If this environment variable is not present, it defaults to ~/.config

       XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
              Specifies a colon-separated list of system directories in which to search for configuration data.  If this environment variable is not present, it defaults to /etc/xdg

FILES
       xfdesktop searches for a menu description file in $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/menus/xfce-applications.menu.  xfdesktop can also use a user-customized menu in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/menus/.
