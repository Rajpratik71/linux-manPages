NAME
       tipc - a TIPC configuration and management tool

SYNOPSIS
       tipc [ OPTIONS ] COMMAND ARGUMENTS

       COMMAND := { bearer | link | media | nametable | node | socket }

       OPTIONS := { -h[help] }

DESCRIPTION
       The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol offers total address transparency between processes which allows applications in a clustered computer environment to communicate
       quickly and reliably with each other, regardless of their location within the cluster.

       TIPC originated at the telecommunications manufacturer Ericsson. The first open source version of TIPC was created in 2000 when Ericsson released its first Linux version of TIPC. TIPC was
       introduced in the mainline Linux kernel in 2006 and is now widely used both within and outside of Ericsson.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help about last given command. For example tipc bearer --help will show bearer help and tipc --help will show general help. The position of the option in the string is irrelevant.

COMMANDS
       BEARER - Show or modify TIPC bearers

       LINK   - Show or modify TIPC links

       MEDIA  - Show or modify TIPC media

       NAMETABLE
              - Show TIPC nametable

       NODE   - Show or modify TIPC node parameters

       SOCKET - Show TIPC sockets

ARGUMENTS
       Command arguments are described in a command specific man page and typically consists of nested commands along with key value pairs.  If no arguments are given a command typically shows its
       help text. The explicit help option -h or --help can occur anywhere among the arguments and will show help for the last valid command given.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon failure.
