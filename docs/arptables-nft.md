DESCRIPTION
       arptables  is  a  user space tool, it is used to set up and maintain the tables of ARP rules in
       the Linux kernel. These rules inspect the ARP frames which they see.  arptables is analogous to
       the iptables user space tool, but arptables is less complicated.

   CHAINS
       The  kernel  table  is  used  to divide functionality into different sets of rules. Each set of
       rules is called a chain.  Each chain is an ordered list of rules that can match ARP frames.  If
       a  rule matches an ARP frame, then a processing specification tells what to do with that match‐
       ing frame. The processing specification is called a 'target'. However, if the  frame  does  not
       match  the current rule in the chain, then the next rule in the chain is examined and so forth.
       The user can create new (user-defined) chains which can be used as the 'target' of a rule.

   TARGETS
       A firewall rule specifies criteria for an ARP frame and a frame processing specification called
       a  target.  When a frame matches a rule, then the next action performed by the kernel is speci‐
       fied by the target.  The target can be one of these values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RETURN,  an
       'extension' (see below) or a user-defined chain.

       ACCEPT means to let the frame through.  DROP means the frame has to be dropped.  CONTINUE means
       the next rule has to be checked. This can be handy to know how many frames pass a certain point
       in the chain or to log those frames.  RETURN means stop traversing this chain and resume at the
       next rule in the previous (calling) chain.  For the extension targets please see the TARGET EX‐
       TENSIONS section of this man page.

   TABLES
       There  is  only  one ARP table in the Linux kernel.  The table is filter.  You can drop the '-t
       filter' argument to the arptables command.  The -t argument must be the first argument  on  the
       arptables command line, if used.

       -t, --table
              filter,  is  the only table and contains two built-in chains: INPUT (for frames destined
              for the host) and OUTPUT (for locally-generated frames).

ARPTABLES COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
       After the initial arptables command line argument, the remaining arguments can be divided  into
       several  different  groups.  These groups are commands, miscellaneous commands, rule-specifica‐
       tions, match-extensions, and watcher-extensions.

   COMMANDS
       The arptables command arguments specify the actions to perform on the table defined with the -t
       argument.  If you do not use the -t argument to name a table, the commands apply to the default
       filter table.  With the exception of the -Z command, only one command may be used on  the  com‐
       mand line at a time.

       -A, --append
              Append a rule to the end of the selected chain.

       -D, --delete
              Delete  the  specified rule from the selected chain. There are two ways to use this com‐
              mand. The first is by  specifying  an  interval  of  rule  numbers  to  delete,  syntax:
              start_nr[:end_nr]. Using negative numbers is allowed, for more details about using nega‐
              tive numbers, see the -I command. The second usage is by specifying the complete rule as
              it would have been specified when it was added.

       -I, --insert
              Insert  the specified rule into the selected chain at the specified rule number.  If the
              current number of rules equals N, then the specified number can be between -N  and  N+1.
              For  a  positive number i, it holds that i and i-N-1 specify the same place in the chain
              where the rule should be inserted. The number 0 specifies the place past the  last  rule
              in the chain and using this number is therefore equivalent with using the -A command.

       -R, --replace
              Replaces  the  specified  rule into the selected chain at the specified rule number.  If
              the current number of rules equals N, then the specified number can be between 1 and  N.
              i specifies the place in the chain where the rule should be replaced.

       -P, --policy
              Set  the policy for the chain to the given target. The policy can be ACCEPT, DROP or RE‐
              TURN.

       -F, --flush
              Flush the selected chain. If no chain is selected, then every  chain  will  be  flushed.
              Flushing the chain does not change the policy of the chain, however.

       -Z, --zero
              Set  the  counters of the selected chain to zero. If no chain is selected, all the coun‐
              ters are set to zero. The -Z command can be used in conjunction  with  the  -L  command.
              When  both  the  -Z and -L commands are used together in this way, the rule counters are
              printed on the screen before they are set to zero.

       -L, --list
              List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are listed.

       -N, --new-chain
              Create a new user-defined chain with the given name. The number of  user-defined  chains
              is unlimited. A user-defined chain name has maximum length of 31 characters.

       -X, --delete-chain
              Delete  the  specified  user-defined chain. There must be no remaining references to the
              specified chain, otherwise arptables will refuse to delete it. If no chain is specified,
              all user-defined chains that aren't referenced will be removed.

       -E, --rename-chain
              Rename  the  specified  chain to a new name.  Besides renaming a user-defined chain, you
              may rename a standard chain name to a name that suits your taste. For  example,  if  you
              like  PREBRIDGING  more  than  PREROUTING, then you can use the -E command to rename the
              PREROUTING chain. If you do rename one of the standard arptables chain names, please  be
              sure to mention this fact should you post a question on the arptables mailing lists.  It
              would be wise to use the standard name in your post. Renaming a standard arptables chain
              in  this  fashion has no effect on the structure or function of the arptables kernel ta‐
              ble.

   MISCELLANOUS COMMANDS
       -V, --version
              Show the version of the arptables userspace program.

       -h, --help
              Give a brief description of the command syntax.

       -j, --jump target
              The target of the rule. This is one of the following values: ACCEPT, DROP, CONTINUE, RE‐
              TURN, a target extension (see TARGET EXTENSIONS) or a user-defined chain name.

       -c, --set-counters PKTS BYTES
              This  enables  the  administrator  to  initialize the packet and byte counters of a rule
              (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations).

   RULE-SPECIFICATIONS
       The following command line arguments make up a rule specification  (as  used  in  the  add  and
       delete  commands).  A  "!" option before the specification inverts the test for that specifica‐
       tion. Apart from these standard rule specifications there are some other command line arguments
       of interest.

       -s, --source-ip [!] address[/mask]
              The Source IP specification.

       -d, --destination-ip [!] address[/mask]
              The Destination IP specification.

       --source-mac [!] address[/mask]
              The source mac address. Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal numbers sepa‐
              rated by colons.

       --destination-mac [!] address[/mask]
              The destination mac address. Both mask and address are written as 6 hexadecimal  numbers
              separated by colons.

       -i, --in-interface [!] name
              The  interface  via which a frame is received (for the INPUT chain). The flag --in-if is
              an alias for this option.

       -o, --out-interface [!] name
              The interface via which a frame is going to be sent (for the  OUTPUT  chain).  The  flag
              --out-if is an alias for this option.

       -l, --h-length length[/mask]
              The hardware length (nr of bytes)

       --opcode code[/mask]
              The  operation code (2 bytes). Available values are: 1=Request 2=Reply 3=Request_Reverse
              4=Reply_Reverse 5=DRARP_Request 6=DRARP_Reply 7=DRARP_Error 8=InARP_Request 9=ARP_NAK.

       --h-type type[/mask]
              The hardware type (2 bytes, hexadecimal). Available values are: 1=Ethernet.

       --proto-type type[/mask]
              The protocol type (2 bytes). Available values are: 0x800=IPv4.

   TARGET-EXTENSIONS
       arptables extensions are precompiled into the userspace tool. So there is no need to explicitly
       load them with a -m option like in iptables.  However, these extensions deal with functionality
       supported by supplemental kernel modules.

   mangle
       --mangle-ip-s IP address
              Mangles Source IP Address to given value.

       --mangle-ip-d IP address
              Mangles Destination IP Address to given value.

       --mangle-mac-s MAC address
              Mangles Source MAC Address to given value.

       --mangle-mac-d MAC address
              Mangles Destination MAC Address to given value.

       --mangle-target target
              Target of ARP mangle operation (DROP, CONTINUE or ACCEPT -- default is ACCEPT).

   CLASSIFY
       This  module  allows you to set the skb->priority value (and thus clas- sify the packet into  a
       specific CBQ class).

       --set-class major:minor

              Set the major and minor  class  value.  The  values  are  always interpreted as hexadec‐
              imal even if no 0x prefix is given.

   MARK
       This  module  allows you to set the skb->mark value (and thus classify the packet by  the  mark
       in u32)

       --set-mark mark
              Set  the  mark  value. The  values  are  always interpreted as hexadecimal even if no 0x
              prefix is given

       --and-mark mark
              Binary AND the mark with bits.

       --or-mark mark
              Binary OR the mark with bits.

NOTES
       In this nft-based version of arptables, support for FORWARD chain  has  not  been  implemented.
       Since ARP packets are "forwarded" only by Linux bridges, the same may be achieved using FORWARD
       chain in ebtables.
