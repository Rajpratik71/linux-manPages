NAME
       swift-container-server - OpenStack Swift container server


SYNOPSIS
       swift-container-server [CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose]


DESCRIPTION
       The  Container  Server's primary job is to handle listings of objects. It doesn't know where those objects are, just what objects are in a specific container. The listings are stored as sqlite data‚Äê
       base files, and replicated across the cluster similar to how objects are. Statistics are also tracked that include the total number of objects, and total storage usage for that container.
