NAME
       bro - passive network traffic analyzer

SYNOPSIS
       bro  [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Bro is primarily a security monitor that inspects all traffic on a link in depth for signs of suspicious activity. More generally, however,
       Bro supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks even outside of the security domain, including  performance  measurements  and  helping
       with trouble-shooting.

       Bro  comes  with built-in functionality for a range of analysis and detection tasks, including detecting malware by interfacing to external
       registries, reporting vulnerable versions of software seen on the network, identifying popular web applications, detecting SSH  brute-forc‚Äê
       ing, validating SSL certificate chains, among others.
