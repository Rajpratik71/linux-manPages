NAME
       virt-make-fs - Make a filesystem from a tar archive or files

SYNOPSIS
        virt-make-fs [--options] input.tar output.img

        virt-make-fs [--options] input.tar.gz output.img

        virt-make-fs [--options] directory output.img

DESCRIPTION
       Virt-make-fs is a command line tool for creating a filesystem from a tar archive or some files in a directory.  It is similar to tools like mkisofs(1), genisoimage(1) and mksquashfs(1).  Unlike
       those tools, it can create common filesystem types like ext2/3 or NTFS, which can be useful if you want to attach these filesystems to existing virtual machines (eg. to import large amounts of
       read-only data to a VM).

       To create blank disks, use virt-format(1).  To create complex layouts, use guestfish(1).

       Basic usage is:

        virt-make-fs input output.img

       where "input" is either a directory containing files that you want to add, or a tar archive (either uncompressed tar or gzip-compressed tar); and output.img is a disk image.  The input type is
       detected automatically.  The output disk image defaults to a raw ext2 sparse image unless you specify extra flags (see "OPTIONS" below).

   FILESYSTEM TYPE
       The default filesystem type is "ext2".  Just about any filesystem type that libguestfs supports can be used (but not read-only formats like ISO9660).  Here are some of the more common choices:

       ext3
           Note that ext3 filesystems contain a journal, typically 1-32 MB in size.  If you are not going to use the filesystem in a way that requires the journal, then this is just wasted overhead.

       ntfs or vfat
           Useful if exporting data to a Windows guest.

       minix
           Lower overhead than "ext2", but certain limitations on filename length and total filesystem size.

       EXAMPLE

        virt-make-fs --type=minix input minixfs.img

   TO PARTITION OR NOT TO PARTITION
       Optionally virt-make-fs can add a partition table to the output disk.

       Adding a partition can make the disk image more compatible with certain virtualized operating systems which don't expect to see a filesystem directly located on a block device (Linux doesn't
       care and will happily handle both types).

       On the other hand, if you have a partition table then the output image is no longer a straight filesystem.  For example you cannot run fsck(8) directly on a partitioned disk image.  (However
       libguestfs tools such as guestfish(1) and virt-resize(1) can still be used).

       EXAMPLE

       Add an MBR partition:

        virt-make-fs --partition -- input disk.img

       If the output disk image could be terabyte-sized or larger, it's better to use an EFI/GPT-compatible partition table:

        virt-make-fs --partition=gpt --size=+4T --format=qcow2 input disk.img

   EXTRA SPACE
       Unlike formats such as tar and squashfs, a filesystem does not "just fit" the files that it contains, but might have extra space.  Depending on how you are going to use the output, you might
       think this extra space is wasted and want to minimize it, or you might want to leave space so that more files can be added later.  Virt-make-fs defaults to minimizing the extra space, but you
       can use the --size flag to leave space in the filesystem if you want it.

       An alternative way to leave extra space but not make the output image any bigger is to use an alternative disk image format (instead of the default "raw" format).  Using --format=qcow2 will use
       the native qemu/KVM qcow2 image format (check your hypervisor supports this before using it).  This allows you to choose a large --size but the extra space won't actually be allocated in the
       image until you try to store something in it.

       Don't forget that you can also use local commands including resize2fs(8) and virt-resize(1) to resize existing filesystems, or rerun virt-make-fs to build another image from scratch.

       EXAMPLE

        virt-make-fs --format=qcow2 --size=+200M input output.img

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display brief help.

       --floppy
           Create a virtual floppy disk.

           Currently this preselects the size (1440K), partition type (MBR) and filesystem type (VFAT).  In future it may also choose the geometry.

       --size=<N>
       --size=+<N>
       -s <N>
       -s +<N>
           Use the --size (or -s) option to choose the size of the output image.

           If this option is not given, then the output image will be just large enough to contain all the files, with not much wasted space.

           To choose a fixed size output disk, specify an absolute number followed by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or Exabytes.  This must be large
           enough to contain all the input files, else you will get an error.

           To leave extra space, specify "+" (plus sign) and a number followed by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or Exabytes.  For example:
           --size=+200M means enough space for the input files, and (approximately) an extra 200 MB free space.

           Note that virt-make-fs estimates free space, and therefore will not produce filesystems containing precisely the free space requested.  (It is much more expensive and time-consuming to
           produce a filesystem which has precisely the desired free space).

       --format=<fmt>
       -F <fmt>
           Choose the output disk image format.

           The default is "raw" (raw sparse disk image).

       --type=<fs>
       -t <fs>
           Choose the output filesystem type.

           The default is "ext2".

           Any filesystem which is supported read-write by libguestfs can be used here.

       --label=<LABEL>
           Set the filesystem label.

       --partition
       --partition=<parttype>
           If specified, this flag adds an MBR partition table to the output disk image.

           You can change the partition table type, eg. --partition=gpt for large disks.

           For MBR, virt-make-fs sets the partition type byte automatically.

       -v
       --verbose
           Enable debugging information.

       -V
       --version
           Display version number and exit.

       -x  Enable libguestfs trace.
