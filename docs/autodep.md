NAME
       aa-autodep - guess basic AppArmor profile requirements

SYNOPSIS
       aa-autodep <executable> [<executable> ...]

DESCRIPTION
       aa-autodep is used to generate a minimal AppArmor profile for a set of executables. This program will generate a profile for binary executable as well as interpreted script programs. At a minimum
       aa-autodep will provide a base profile containing a base include directive which includes basic profile entries needed by most programs.  The profile is generated by recursively calling ldd(1) on
       the executables listed on the command line.

BUGS
       This program does not perform full static analysis of executables, so the profiles generated are necessarily incomplete. If you find any bugs, please report them at
       <https://bugs.launchpad.net/apparmor/+filebug>.
