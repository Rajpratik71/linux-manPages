lxc-autostart(1)                                                                     lxc-autostart(1)

NAME
       lxc-autostart - start/stop/kill auto-started containers

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-autostart [-k] [-L] [-r] [-s] [-a] [-A] [-g groups] [-t timeout]

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-autostart  processes containers with lxc.start.auto set. It lets the user start, shutdown,
       kill, restart containers in the right order, waiting the right  time.  Supports  filtering  by
       lxc.group or just run against all defined containers. It can also be used by external tools in
       list mode where no action will be performed and the list of affected containers (and if  rele‐
       vant, delays) will be shown.

       The [-r], [-s] and [-k] options specify the action to perform.  If none is specified, then the
       containers will be started.  [-a] and [-g] are used to specify which containers  will  be  af‐
       fected.  By  default  only  containers without a lxc.group set will be affected.  [-t TIMEOUT]
       specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the container to complete the shutdown or re‐
       boot.

OPTIONS
       -r,--reboot
              Request a reboot of the container.

       -s,--shutdown
              Request  a  clean shutdown. If a [-t timeout] greater than 0 is given and the container
              has not shut down within this period, it will be killed as with the [-k kill] option.

       -k,--kill
              Rather than requesting a clean shutdown of the container, explicitly kill all tasks  in
              the container.

       -L,--list
              Rather  than performing the action, just print the container name and wait delays until
              starting the next container.

       -t,--timeout TIMEOUT
              Wait TIMEOUT seconds before hard-stopping the container.

       -g,--group GROUP
              Comma separated list of groups to select (defaults to those without a lxc.group  -  the
              NULL group).  This option may be specified multiple times and the arguments concatenat‐
              ed. The NULL or empty group may be specified as a leading comma, trailing comma, embed‐
              ded  double  comma, or empty argument where the NULL group should be processed.  Groups
              are processed in the order specified on the command line. Multiple invocations  of  the
              -g  option may be freely intermixed with the comma separated lists and will be combined
              in specified order.

       -a,--all
              Ignore lxc.group and select all auto-started containers.

       -A,--ignore-auto
              Ignore the lxc.start.auto flag. Combined with -a, will select  all  containers  on  the
              system.

AUTOSTART AND SYSTEM BOOT
       The  lxc-autostart  command  is used as part of the LXC system service, when enabled to run on
       host system at bootup and at shutdown. It's used to select which containers to start  in  what
       order and how much to delay between each startup when the host system boots.

       Each  container  can  be part of any number of groups or no group at all.  Two groups are spe‐
       cial. One is the NULL group, i.e. the container does not belong to any group. The other  group
       is the "onboot" group.

       When the system boots with the LXC service enabled, it will first attempt to boot any contain‐
       ers with lxc.start.auto == 1 that is a member of the "onboot" group. The startup  will  be  in
       order  of  lxc.start.order.  If an lxc.start.delay has been specified, that delay will be hon‐
       ored before attempting to start the next container to give the current container time to begin
       initialization  and reduce overloading the host system. After starting the members of the "on‐
       boot" group, the LXC system will proceed to boot containers with lxc.start.auto == 1 which are
       not members of any group (the NULL group) and proceed as with the onboot group.

STARTUP GROUP EXAMPLES
       -g "onboot,"
              Start the "onboot" group first then the NULL group.

              This is the equivalent of: -g onboot -g "".

       -g "dns,web,,onboot"
              Starts  the  "dns" group first, the "web" group second, then the NULL group followed by
              the "onboot" group.

              This is the equivalent of: -g dns,web -g ,onboot or -g dns -g web -g "" -g onboot.
