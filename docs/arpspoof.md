ARPSPOOF(8)                                                   System Manager's Manual                                                  ARPSPOOF(8)

NAME
       arpspoof - intercept packets on a switched LAN

SYNOPSIS
       arpspoof [-i interface] [-c own|host|both] [-t target] [-r] host

DESCRIPTION
       arpspoof  redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies.  This
       is an extremely effective way of sniffing traffic on a switch.

       Kernel IP forwarding (or a userland program which accomplishes the same, e.g. fragrouter(8)) must be turned on ahead of time.

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              Specify the interface to use.

       -c own|host|both
              Specify which hardware address t use when restoring the arp configuration; while cleaning up, packets  can  be  send  with  the  own
              address  as  well  as  with  the  address  of the host. Sending packets with a fake hw address can disrupt connectivity with certain
              switch/ap/bridge configurations, however it works more reliably than using the own address, which is the default way arpspoof cleans
              up afterwards.

       -t target
              Specify a particular host to ARP poison (if not specified, all hosts on the LAN). Repeat to specify multiple hosts.

       -r     Poison both hosts (host and target) to capture traffic in both directions.  (only valid in conjuntion with -t)

       host   Specify the host you wish to intercept packets for (usually the local gateway).
