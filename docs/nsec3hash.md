NAME
       nsec3hash - generate NSEC3 hash

SYNOPSIS
       nsec3hash {salt} {algorithm} {iterations} {domain}

DESCRIPTION
       nsec3hash generates an NSEC3 hash based on a set of NSEC3 parameters. This can be used to check the validity of NSEC3 records in a signed zone.

ARGUMENTS
       salt
           The salt provided to the hash algorithm.

       algorithm
           A number indicating the hash algorithm. Currently the only supported hash algorithm for NSEC3 is SHA-1, which is indicated by the number 1; consequently "1" is the only useful value for this
           argument.

       iterations
           The number of additional times the hash should be performed.

       domain
           The domain name to be hashed.
