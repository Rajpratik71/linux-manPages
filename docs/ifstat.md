NAME
       ifstat - handy utility to read network interface statistics

SYNOPSIS
       ifstat [ OPTIONS ] [ INTERFACE_LIST ]

       INTERFACE_LIST := INTERFACE_LIST | interface

DESCRIPTION
       ifstat  neatly  prints out network interface statistics.  The utility keeps records of the previous data displayed in history files and by default only shows difference between the last and the cur‚Äê
       rent call.  Location of the history files defaults to /tmp/.ifstat.u$UID but may be overridden with the IFSTAT_HISTORY environment variable. Similarly,  the  default  location  for  xstat  (extended
       stats) is /tmp/.<xstat name>_ifstat.u$UID.
