NAME
       netsniff-ng - the packet sniffing beast

SYNOPSIS
       netsniff-ng { [options] [filter-expression] }

DESCRIPTION
       netsniff-ng  is a fast, minimal tool to analyze network packets, capture pcap files, replay pcap files, and redirect traffic between inter‐
       faces with the help of zero-copy packet(7) sockets. netsniff-ng uses both Linux specific RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces  to  perform  zero-
       copy.  This  is  to  avoid copy and system call overhead between kernel and user address space. When we started working on netsniff-ng, the
       pcap(3) library did not use this zero-copy facility.

       netsniff-ng is Linux specific, meaning there is no support for other operating systems. Therefore we can keep the code footprint quite min‐
       imal  and to the point. Linux packet(7) sockets and its RX_RING and TX_RING interfaces bypass the normal packet processing path through the
       networking stack.  This is the fastest capturing or transmission performance one can get from user space out of the box, without having  to
       load  unsupported or non-mainline third-party kernel modules. We explicitly refuse to build netsniff-ng on top of ntop/PF_RING. Not because
       we do not like it (we do find it interesting), but because of the fact that it is not part of the  mainline  kernel.  Therefore,  the  ntop
       project  has to maintain and sync out-of-tree drivers to adapt them to their DNA. Eventually, we went for untainted Linux kernel, since its
       code has a higher rate of review, maintenance, security and bug fixes.

       netsniff-ng also supports early packet filtering in the kernel. It has support for low-level and high-level packet filters that are  trans‐
       lated into Berkeley Packet Filter instructions.

       netsniff-ng  can  capture  pcap  files in several different pcap formats that are interoperable with other tools. It has different pcap I/O
       methods supported (scatter-gather, mmap(2), read(2), and write(2)) for efficient to-disc capturing.  netsniff-ng is  also  able  to  rotate
       pcap files based on data size or time intervals, thus, making it a useful backend tool for subsequent traffic analysis.

       netsniff-ng  itself  also supports analysis, replaying, and dumping of raw 802.11 frames. For online or offline analysis, netsniff-ng has a
       built-in packet dissector for the current 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.11* (WLAN), ARP, MPLS, 802.1Q (VLAN), 802.1QinQ, LLDP, IPv4, IPv6,  ICMPv4,
       ICMPv6,  IGMP,  TCP and UDP, including GeoIP location analysis. Since netsniff-ng does not establish any state or perform reassembly during
       packet dissection, its memory footprint is quite low, thus, making netsniff-ng quite efficient for offline analysis of large pcap files  as
       well.

       Note  that netsniff-ng is currently not multithreaded. However, this does not prevent you from starting multiple netsniff-ng instances that
       are pinned to different, non-overlapping CPUs and f.e. have different BPF filters attached.  Likely that at some point in time  your  hard‐
       disc  might become a bottleneck assuming you do not rotate such pcaps in ram (and from there periodically scheduled move to slower medias).
       You can then use mergecap(1) to transform all pcaps into a single large pcap. Thus, netsniff-ng then works multithreaded eventually.

       netsniff-ng can also be used to debug netlink traffic.

OPTIONS
   -i <dev|pcap|->, -d <dev|pcap|->, --in <dev|pcap|->, --dev <dev|pcap|->
       Defines an input device. This can either be a networking device, a pcap file or stdin (“-”). In case of a pcap file, the  pcap  type  (“-D”
       option)  is  determined  automatically by the pcap file magic. In case of stdin, it is assumed that the input stream is a pcap file. If the
       pcap link type is Netlink and pcap type is default format (usec or nsec), then each packet will be wrapped with pcap cooked header [2].

   -o <dev|pcap|dir|cfg|->, --out <dev|pcap|dir|cfg|->
       Defines the output device. This can either be a networking device, a pcap file, a folder, a trafgen(8) configuration file or stdout  (“-”).
       In  the  case  of  a  pcap  file that should not have the default pcap type (0xa1b2c3d4), the additional option “-T” must be provided. If a
       directory is given, then, instead of a single pcap file, multiple pcap files are generated with rotation based on maximum file  size  or  a
       given  interval  (“-F” option). Optionally, sending the SIGHUP signal to the netsniff-ng process causes a premature rotation of the file. A
       trafgen configuration file can currently only be specified if the input device is a pcap file. To  specify  a   pcap  file  as  the  output
       device,  the  file name must have “.pcap” as its extension. If stdout is given as a device, then a trafgen configuration will be written to
       stdout if the input device is a pcap file, or a pcap file if the input device is a networking device. In case if  the  input  device  is  a
       Netlink monitor device and pcap type is default (usec or nsec) then each packet will be wrapped with pcap cooked header [2] to keep Netlink
       family number (Kuznetzov's and netsniff-ng pcap types already contain family number in protocol number field).

   -C <id>, --fanout-group <id>
       If multiple netsniff-ng instances are being started that all have the same packet fanout group id, then the ingress network  traffic  being
       captured  is  being  distributed/load-balanced  among these group participants. This gives a much better scaling than running multiple net‐
       sniff-ng processes without a fanout group parameter in parallel, but only with a BPF filter attached as a packet would otherwise need to be
       delivered to all such capturing processes, instead of only once to such a fanout member. Naturally, each fanout member can have its own BPF
       filters attached.

   -K <hash|lb|cpu|rnd|roll|qm>, --fanout-type <hash|lb|cpu|rnd|roll|qm>
       This parameter specifies the fanout discipline, in other words, how the captured network traffic is dispatched to the fanout group members.
       Options  are  to  distribute  traffic by the packet hash (“hash”), in a round-robin manner (“lb”), by CPU the packet arrived on (“cpu”), by
       random (“rnd”), by rolling over sockets (“roll”) which means if one socket's queue is full, we move on to the next one, or by NIC  hardware
       queue mapping (“qm”).

   -L <defrag|roll>, --fanout-opts <defrag|roll>
       Defines  some  auxiliary  fanout options to be used in addition to a given fanout type.  These options apply to any fanout type. In case of
       “defrag”, the kernel is being told to defragment packets before delivering to user space, and “roll” provides the same roll-over option  as
       the “roll” fanout type, so that on any different fanout type being used (e.g. “qm”) the socket may temporarily roll over to the next fanout
       group member in case the original one's queue is full.

   -f, --filter <bpf-file|-|expr>
       Specifies to not dump all traffic, but to filter the network packet haystack.  As a filter, either a bpfc(8)  compiled  file/stdin  can  be
       passed  as  a  parameter  or  a tcpdump(1)-like filter expression in quotes. For details regarding the bpf-file have a look at bpfc(8), for
       details regarding a tcpdump(1)-like filter have a look at section “filter example” or at pcap-filter(7). A filter expression  may  also  be
       passed to netsniff-ng without option “-f” in case there is no subsequent option following after the command-line filter expression.

   -t, --type <type>
       This  defines  some sort of filtering mechanisms in terms of addressing. Possible values for type are “host” (to us), “broadcast” (to all),
       “multicast” (to group), “others” (promiscuous mode) or “outgoing” (from us).

   -F, --interval <size|time>
       If the output device is a folder, with “-F”, it is possible to define the pcap file rotation interval either in  terms  of  size  or  time.
       Thus,  when  the  interval  limit  has  been reached, a new pcap file will be started. As size parameter, the following values are accepted
       “<num>KiB/MiB/GiB”; As time parameter, it can be “<num>s/sec/min/hrs”.

   -J, --jumbo-support
       By default, in pcap replay or redirect mode, netsniff-ng's ring buffer frames are a fixed size of 2048 bytes. This means that  if  you  are
       expecting  jumbo  frames  or  even  super jumbo frames to pass through your network, then you need to enable support for that by using this
       option. However, this has the disadvantage of performance degradation and a bigger memory footprint for the ring  buffer.  Note  that  this
       doesn't affect (pcap) capturing mode, since tpacket in version 3 is used!

   -R, --rfraw
       In case the input or output networking device is a wireless device, it is possible with netsniff-ng to turn this into monitor mode and cre‐
       ate a mon<X> device that netsniff-ng will be listening on instead of wlan<X>, for instance.  This enables netsniff-ng to analyze, dump,  or
       even replay raw 802.11 frames.

   -n <0|uint>, --num <0|uint>
       Process  a  number  of  packets  and then exit. If the number of packets is 0, then this is equivalent to infinite packets resp. processing
       until interrupted.  Otherwise, a number given as an unsigned integer will limit processing.

   -P <name>, --prefix <name>
       When dumping pcap files into a folder, a file name prefix can be defined with this option. If not otherwise specified, the  default  prefix
       is “dump-” followed by a Unix timestamp. Use “--prefex ""” to set filename as seconds since the Unix Epoch e.g. 1369179203.pcap

   -T <pcap-magic>, --magic <pcap-magic>
       Specify  a  pcap type for storage. Different pcap types with their various meta data capabilities are shown with option “-D”. If not other‐
       wise specified, the pcap-magic 0xa1b2c3d4, also known as a standard tcpdump-capable pcap format, is used. Pcap files with  swapped  endian‐
       ness are also supported.

   -D, --dump-pcap-types
       Dump all available pcap types with their capabilities and magic numbers that can be used with option “-T” to stdout and exit.

   -B, --dump-bpf
       If  a  Berkeley  Packet  Filter is given, for example via option “-f”, then dump the BPF disassembly to stdout during ring setup. This only
       serves for informative or verification purposes.

   -r, --rand
       If the input and output device are both networking devices, then this option will randomize packet order in the output ring buffer.

   -M, --no-promisc
       The networking interface will not be put into promiscuous mode. By default, promiscuous mode is turned on.

   -N, --no-hwtimestamp
       Disable taking hardware time stamps for RX packets. By default, if the network device supports hardware time stamping,  the  hardware  time
       stamps  will  be used when writing packets to pcap files. This option disables this behavior and forces (kernel based) software time stamps
       to be used, even if hardware time stamps are available.

   -A, --no-sock-mem
       On startup and shutdown, netsniff-ng tries to increase socket read and write buffers if appropriate. This option will  prevent  netsniff-ng
       from doing so.

   -m, --mmap
       Use mmap(2) as pcap file I/O. This is the default when replaying pcap files.

   -G, --sg
       Use scatter-gather as pcap file I/O. This is the default when capturing pcap files.

   -c, --clrw
       Use  slower read(2) and write(2) I/O. This is not the default case anywhere, but in some situations it could be preferred as it has a lower
       latency on write-back to disc.

   -S <size>, --ring-size <size>
       Manually define the RX_RING resp. TX_RING size in “<num>KiB/MiB/GiB”. By default, the size is determined based on the network  connectivity
       rate.

   -k <uint>, --kernel-pull <uint>
       Manually  define the interval in micro-seconds where the kernel should be triggered to batch process the ring buffer frames. By default, it
       is every 10us, but it can manually be prolonged, for instance.

   -b <cpu>, --bind-cpu <cpu>
       Pin netsniff-ng to a specific CPU and also pin resp. migrate the NIC's IRQ CPU affinity to this CPU. This option  should  be  preferred  in
       combination with “-s” in case a middle to high packet rate is expected.

   -u <uid>, --user <uid> resp. -g <gid>, --group <gid>
       After ring setup drop privileges to a non-root user/group combination.

   -H, --prio-high
       Set  this  process  as a high priority process in order to achieve a higher scheduling rate resp. CPU time. This is however not the default
       setting, since it could lead to starvation of other processes, for example low priority kernel threads.

   -Q, --notouch-irq
       Do not reassign the NIC's IRQ CPU affinity settings.

   -s, --silent
       Do not enter the packet dissector at all and do not print any packet information to the terminal. Just shut up and be silent.  This  option
       should  be preferred in combination with pcap recording or replay, since it will not flood your terminal which causes a significant perfor‐
       mance degradation.

   -q, --less
       Print a less verbose one-line information for each packet to the terminal.

   -X, --hex
       Only dump packets in hex format to the terminal.

   -l, --ascii
       Only display ASCII printable characters.

   -U, --update
       If geographical IP location is used, the built-in database update mechanism will be invoked to get Maxmind's latest database. To  configure
       search  locations for databases, the file /etc/netsniff-ng/geoip.conf contains possible addresses. Thus, to save bandwidth or for mirroring
       of Maxmind's databases (to bypass their traffic limit policy), different hosts or IP addresses can be placed into geoip.conf, separated  by
       a newline.

   -w, --cooked
       Replace  each frame link header with Linux "cooked" header [3] which keeps info about link type and protocol. It allows to dump and dissect
       frames captured from different link types when -i "any" was specified, for example.

   -V, --verbose
       Be more verbose during startup i.e. show detailed ring setup information.

   -v, --version
       Show version information and exit.

   -h, --help
       Show user help and exit.

USAGE EXAMPLE
   netsniff-ng
       The most simple command is to just run “netsniff-ng”. This will start listening on all available networking devices in promiscuous mode and
       dump the packet dissector output to the terminal. No files will be recorded.

   netsniff-ng --in eth0 --out dump.pcap -s -T 0xa1e2cb12 -b 0 tcp or udp
       Capture  TCP  or UDP traffic from the networking device eth0 into the pcap file named dump.pcap, which has netsniff-ng specific pcap exten‐
       sions (see “netsniff-ng -D” for capabilities). Also, do not print the content to the terminal and pin the process and NIC IRQ  affinity  to
       CPU 0. The pcap write method is scatter-gather I/O.

   netsniff-ng --in wlan0 --rfraw --out dump.pcap --silent --bind-cpu 0
       Put  the  wlan0 device into monitoring mode and capture all raw 802.11 frames into the file dump.pcap. Do not dissect and print the content
       to the terminal and pin the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The pcap write method is scatter-gather I/O.

   netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap --mmap --out eth0 -k1000 --silent --bind-cpu 0
       Replay the pcap file dump.pcap which is read through mmap(2) I/O and send the packets out via the eth0 networking device.  Do  not  dissect
       and print the content to the terminal and pin the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0.  Also, trigger the kernel every 1000us to traverse
       the TX_RING instead of every 10us. Note that the pcap magic type is detected automatically from the pcap file header.

   netsniff-ng --in eth0 --out eth1 --silent --bind-cpu 0 --type host -r
       Redirect network traffic from the networking device eth0 to eth1 for traffic that is destined for our host, thus ignore  broadcast,  multi‐
       cast  and promiscuous traffic. Randomize the order of packets for the outgoing device and do not print any packet contents to the terminal.
       Also, pin the process and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0.

   netsniff-ng --in team0 --out /opt/probe/ -s -m --interval 100MiB -b 0
       Capture on an aggregated team0 networking device and dump packets into multiple pcap files that are split into 100MiB each. Use mmap(2) I/O
       as  a  pcap  write  method, support for super jumbo frames is built-in (does not need to be configured here), and do not print the captured
       data to the terminal. Pin netsniff-ng and NIC IRQ affinity to CPU 0. The default pcap magic type is 0xa1b2c3d4 (tcpdump-capable pcap).

   netsniff-ng --in vlan0 --out dump.pcap -c -u `id -u bob` -g `id -g bob`
       Capture network traffic on device vlan0 into a pcap file called dump.pcap by using normal read(2), write(2) I/O for the pcap  file  (slower
       but less latency). Also, after setting up the RX_RING for capture, drop privileges from root to the user and group “bob”. Invoke the packet
       dissector and print packet contents to the terminal for further analysis.

   netsniff-ng --in any --filter http.bpf -B --ascii -V
       Capture from all available networking interfaces and install a low-level filter that was previously compiled by bpfc(8)  into  http.bpf  in
       order to filter HTTP traffic. Super jumbo frame support is automatically enabled and only print human readable packet data to the terminal,
       and also be more verbose during setup phase. Moreover, dump a BPF disassembly of http.bpf.

   netsniff-ng --in dump.pcap --out dump.cfg --silent
       Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8) configuration file dump.cfg.  Do not print pcap contents to the terminal.

   netsniff-ng -i dump.pcap -f beacon.bpf -o -
       Convert the pcap file dump.pcap into a trafgen(8) configuration file and write it to stdout. However, do not dump all of its  content,  but
       only  the  one that passes the low-level filter for raw 802.11 from beacon.bpf. The BPF engine here is invoked in user space inside of net‐
       sniff-ng, so Linux extensions are not available.

   cat foo.pcap | netsniff-ng -i - -o -
       Read a pcap file from stdin and convert it into a trafgen(8) configuration file to stdout.

   modprobe nlmon
   ip link add type nlmon
   ip link set nlmon0 up
   netsniff-ng -i nlmon0 -o dump.pcap -s
   ip link set nlmon0 down
   ip link del dev nlmon0
   rmmod nlmon
       In this example, netlink traffic is being captured. If not already done, a netlink monitoring device needs to be set up before  it  can  be
       used to capture netlink socket buffers (iproute2's ip(1) commands are given for nlmon device setup and teardown). netsniff-ng can then make
       use of the nlmon device as an input device. In this example a pcap file with netlink traffic is being recorded.

   netsniff-ng --fanout-group 1 --fanout-type cpu --fanout-opts defrag --bind-cpu 0 --notouch-irq --silent --in em1 --out /var/cap/cpu0/  --inter‐
       val 120sec
   netsniff-ng  --fanout-group 1 --fanout-type cpu --fanout-opts defrag --bind-cpu 1 --notouch-irq --silent --in em1 --out /var/cap/cpu1/ --inter‐
       val 120sec
       Starts two netsniff-ng fanout instances. Both are assigned into the same fanout group membership and traffic  is  splitted  among  them  by
       incoming  cpu.  Furthermore,  the kernel is supposed to defragment possible incoming fragments. First instance is assigned to CPU 0 and the
       second one to CPU 1, IRQ bindings are not altered as they might have been adapted to this scenario by the user  a-priori,  and  traffic  is
       captured  on  interface em1, and written out in 120 second intervals as pcap files into /var/cap/cpu0/. Tools like mergecap(1) will be able
       to merge the cpu0/1 split back together if needed.

CONFIG FILES
       Files under /etc/netsniff-ng/ can be modified to extend netsniff-ng's functionality:

           * oui.conf - OUI/MAC vendor database
           * ether.conf - Ethernet type descriptions
           * tcp.conf - TCP port/services map
           * udp.conf - UDP port/services map
           * geoip.conf - GeoIP database mirrors

FILTER EXAMPLE
       netsniff-ng supports both, low-level and high-level filters that are attached to its packet(7) socket. Low-level filters are  described  in
       the bpfc(8) man page.

       Low-level filters can be used with netsniff-ng in the following way:

           1. bpfc foo > bar
           2. netsniff-ng -f bar
           3. bpfc foo | netsniff-ng -i nlmon0 -f -

       Here,  foo  is the bpfc program that will be translated into a netsniff-ng readable “opcodes” file and passed to netsniff-ng through the -f
       option.

       Similarly, high-level filter can be either passed through the -f option, e.g. -f "tcp or udp" or at the end  of  all  options  without  the
       “-f”.

       The  filter  syntax is the same as in tcpdump(8), which is described in the man page pcap-filter(7). Just to quote some examples from pcap-
       filter(7):

   host sundown
       To select all packets arriving at or departing from sundown.

   host helios and ˛t or ace
       To select traffic between helios and either hot or ace.

   ip host ace and not helios
       To select all IP packets between ace and any host except helios.

   net ucb-ether
       To select all traffic between local hosts and hosts at Berkeley.

   gateway snup and (port ftp or ftp-data)
       To select all FTP traffic through Internet gateway snup.

   ip and not net localnet
       To select traffic neither sourced from, nor destined for, local hosts. If you have a gateway to another network, this traffic should  never
       make it onto your local network.

   tcp[tcpflags] & (tcp-syn|tcp-fin) != 0 and not src and dst net localnet
       To select the start and end packets (the SYN and FIN packets) of each TCP conversation that involve a non-local host.

   tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)
       To  select  all  IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80, that is to say, print only packets that contain data, not, for example, SYN and FIN
       packets and ACK-only packets.  (IPv6 is left as an exercise for the reader.)

   gateway snup and ip[2:2] > 576
       To select IP packets longer than 576 bytes sent through gateway snup.

   ether[0] & 1 = 0 and ip[16] >= 224
       To select IP broadcast or multicast packets that were not sent via Ethernet broadcast or multicast.

   icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echo and icmp[icmptype] != icmp-echoreply
       To select all ICMP packets that are not echo requests or replies (that is to say, not "ping" packets).

PCAP FORMATS:
       netsniff-ng supports a couple of pcap formats, visible through ``netsniff-ng -D'':

   tcpdump-capable pcap (default)
       Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2c3d4 resp. 0xd4c3b2a1. As packet meta data this format contains  the  timeval  in  microseconds,  the
       original packet length and the captured packet length.

   tcpdump-capable pcap with ns resolution
       Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b23c4d resp. 0x4d3cb2a1. As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in nanoseconds, the orig‐
       inal packet length and the captured packet length.

   Alexey Kuznetzov's pcap
       Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1b2cd34 resp. 0x34cdb2a1. As packet meta data this format contains  the  timeval  in  microseconds,  the
       original packet length, the captured packet length, the interface index (sll_ifindex), the packet's protocol (sll_protocol), and the packet
       type (sll_pkttype).

   netsniff-ng pcap
       Pcap magic number is encoded as 0xa1e2cb12 resp. 0x12cbe2a1. As packet meta data this format contains the timeval in nanoseconds, the orig‐
       inal  packet  length,  the  captured  packet  length,  the timestamp hw/sw source, the interface index (sll_ifindex), the packet's protocol
       (sll_protocol), the packet type (sll_pkttype) and the hardware type (sll_hatype).

       For further implementation details or format support in your application, have a look at pcap_io.h.

NOTE
       To avoid confusion, it should be noted that there is another network analyzer with a similar name, called NetSniff, that  is  unrelated  to
       the netsniff-ng project.

       For  introducing  bit  errors,  delays with random variation and more while replaying pcaps, make use of tc(8) with its disciplines such as
       netem.

       netsniff-ng does only some basic, architecture generic tuning on startup. If you are considering to do high performance capturing, you need
       to  carefully  tune your machine, both hardware and software.  Simply letting netsniff-ng run without thinking about your underlying system
       might not necessarily give you the desired performance. Note that tuning your system is always a tradeoff and  fine-grained  balancing  act
       (throughput versus latency). You should know what you are doing!

       One  recommendation  for  software-based tuning is tuned(8). Besides that, there are many other things to consider. Just to throw you a few
       things that you might want to look at: NAPI networking drivers, tickless kernel, I/OAT DMA engine, Direct Cache Access, RAM-based file sys‐
       tems,  multi-queues,  and  many  more things. Also, you might want to read the kernel's Documentation/networking/scaling.txt file regarding
       technologies such as RSS, RPS, RFS, aRFS and XPS. Also check your ethtool(8) settings, for example regarding offloading or  Ethernet  pause
       frames.

       Moreover, to get a deeper understanding of netsniff-ng internals and how it interacts with the Linux kernel, the kernel documentation under
       Documentation/networking/{packet_mmap.txt, filter.txt, multiqueue.txt} might be of interest.

       How do you sniff in a switched environment? I rudely refer to dSniff's documentation that says:

       The easiest route is simply to impersonate the local gateway, stealing client traffic en route to some remote destination. Of  course,  the
       traffic  must  be forwarded by your attacking machine, either by enabling kernel IP forwarding or with a userland program that accomplishes
       the same (fragrouter -B1).

       Several people have reportedly destroyed connectivity on their LAN to the outside world by ARP spoofing  the  gateway,  and  forgetting  to
       enable IP forwarding on the attacking machine. Do not do this. You have been warned.

       A safer option than ARP spoofing would be to use a "port mirror" function if your switch hardware supports it and if you have access to the
       switch.

       If you do not need to dump all possible traffic, you have to consider running netsniff-ng with a BPF filter for the ingress path. For  that
       purpose, read the bpfc(8) man page.

       Also,  to  aggregate  multiple NICs that you want to capture on, you should consider using team devices, further explained in libteam resp.
       teamd(8).

       The following netsniff-ng pcap magic numbers are compatible with other tools, at least tcpdump or Wireshark:

           0xa1b2c3d4 (tcpdump-capable pcap)
           0xa1b23c4d (tcpdump-capable pcap with ns resolution)
           0xa1b2cd34 (Alexey Kuznetzov's pcap)

       Pcap files with different meta data endianness are supported by netsniff-ng as well.

BUGS
       When replaying pcap files, the timing information from the pcap packet header is currently ignored.

       Also, when replaying pcap files, demultiplexing traffic among multiple networking interfaces does not work. Currently, it is only sent  via
       the interface that is given by the --out parameter.

       When  performing  traffic capture on the Ethernet interface, the pcap file is created and packets are received but without a 802.1Q header.
       When one uses tshark, all headers are visible, but netsniff-ng removes 802.1Q headers. Is that normal behavior?

       Yes and no. The way VLAN headers are handled in PF_PACKET sockets by the kernel is somewhat “problematic” [1]. The  problem  in  the  Linux
       kernel  is  that some drivers already handle VLANs, others do not. Those who handle it can have different implementations, such as hardware
       acceleration and so on.  So in some cases the VLAN tag is even stripped before entering the protocol stack, in some cases probably not. The
       bottom line is that a "hack" was introduced in PF_PACKET so that a VLAN ID is visible in some helper data structure that is accessible from
       the RX_RING.

       Then it gets really messy in the user space to artificially put the VLAN header back into the right place. Not  to  mention  the  resulting
       performance implications on all of libpcap(3) tools since parts of the packet need to be copied for reassembly via memmove(3).

       A  user  reported the following, just to demonstrate this mess: some tests were made with two machines, and it seems that results depend on
       the driver ...

           AR8131:
             ethtool -k eth0 gives "rx-vlan-offload: on"
             - wireshark gets the vlan header
             - netsniff-ng doesn't get the vlan header
             ethtool -K eth0 rxvlan off
             - wireshark gets a QinQ header even though no one sent QinQ
             - netsniff-ng gets the vlan header

           RTL8111/8168B:
             ethtool -k eth0 gives "rx-vlan-offload: on"
             - wireshark gets the vlan header
             - netsniff-ng doesn't get the vlan header
             ethtool -K eth0 rxvlan off
             - wireshark gets the vlan header
             - netsniff-ng doesn't get the vlan header

       Even if we agreed on doing the same workaround as libpcap, we still will not be able to see QinQ, for instance, due to the fact  that  only
       one  VLAN  tag is stored in the kernel helper data structure. We think that there should be a good consensus on the kernel space side about
       what gets transferred to userland first.

       Update (28.11.2012): the Linux kernel and also bpfc(8) has built-in support for hardware accelerated VLAN filtering, even though tags might
       not be visible in the payload itself as reported here. However, the filtering for VLANs works reliable if your NIC supports it. See bpfc(8)
       for an example.
