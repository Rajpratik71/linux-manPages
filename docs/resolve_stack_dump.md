NAME
       resolve_stack_dump - resolve numeric stack trace dump to symbols

SYNOPSIS
       resolve_stack_dump [options] symbols_file [numeric_dump_file]

DESCRIPTION
       resolve_stack_dump resolves a numeric stack dump to symbols.

       Invoke resolve_stack_dump like this:

           shell> resolve_stack_dump [options] symbols_file [numeric_dump_file]

       numeric dump file should contain a numeric stack track from mysqld. If no numeric dump file is
       named on the command line, the stack trace is read from the standard input.

       路   --help, -h

           Display a help message and exit.

       路   --numeric-dump-file=file_name, -n file_name
