NAME
       deltainfoxml2solv - convert rpm-md's deltainfo format into a solv file

SYNOPSIS
       deltainfoxml2solv [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       The deltainfoxml2solv tool reads rpm-mdâ€™s deltainfo.xml data from stdin, and writes it as solv file to standard output. Some distributions name the input prestodelta.xml instead. Each delta rpm
       element is converted and added as repository:deltainfo element to the meta section of the solv file.
