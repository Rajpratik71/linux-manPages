PST2LDIF(1)                                               libpst Utilities - Version 0.6                                               PST2LDIF(1)

NAME
       pst2ldif - extract contacts from a MS Outlook .pst file in .ldif format

SYNOPSIS
       pst2ldif [-V] [-b ldap-base] [-c class] [-d debug-file] [-l extra-line] [-o] [-h] pstfilename

OPTIONS
       -V
           Show program version. Subsequent options are then ignored.

       -b ldap-base
           Sets the ldap base value used in the dn records. You probably want to use something like "o=organization, c=US".

       -c class
           Sets the objectClass values for the contact items. This class needs to be defined in the schema used by your LDAP server, and at a
           minimum it must contain the ldap attributes given below. This option may be specified multiple times to generate entries with multiple
           object classes.

       -d debug-file
           Specify name of debug log file. The log file is now an ascii file, instead of the binary file used in previous versions.

       -l extra-line
           Specify an extra line to be added to each ldap entry. This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple lines to each ldap
           entry.

       -o
           Use the old ldap schema, rather than the default new ldap schema. The old schema generates multiple postalAddress attributes for a
           single entry. The new schema generates a single postalAddress (and homePostalAddress when available) attribute with $ delimiters as
           specified in RFC4517. Using the old schema also generates two extra leading entries, one for "dn:ldap base", and one for "dn: cn=root,
           ldap base".

       -h
           Show summary of options. Subsequent options are then ignored.

DESCRIPTION
       pst2ldif reads the contact information from a MS Outlook .pst file and produces a .ldif file that may be used to import those contacts into
       an LDAP database. The following ldap attributes are generated for the old ldap schema:
           cn
           givenName
           sn
           personalTitle
           company
           mail
           postalAddress
           l
           st
           postalCode
           c
           homePhone
           telephoneNumber
           facsimileTelephoneNumber
           mobile
