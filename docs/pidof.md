PIDOF(8)                                                                          Linux System Administrator's Manual                                                                         PIDOF(8)

NAME
       pidof -- find the process ID of a running program.

SYNOPSIS
       pidof [-s] [-c] [-n] [-x] [-o omitpid[,omitpid..]]  [-o omitpid[,omitpid..]..]  program [program..]

DESCRIPTION
       Pidof  finds  the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It prints those id's on the standard output. This program is on some systems used in run-level change scripts, especially when the
       system has a System-V like rc structure. In that case these scripts are located in /etc/rc?.d, where ? is the runlevel. If the system has a start-stop-daemon (8) program that should  be  used
       instead.

OPTIONS
       -s     Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one pid.

       -c     Only  return  process  ids that are running with the same root directory.  This option is ignored for non-root users, as they will be unable to check the current root directory of pro‚Äê
              cesses they do not own.

       -n     Avoid stat(2) system function call on all binaries which are located on network based file systems like NFS.  Instead of using this option the the variable PIDOF_NETFS may be  set  and
              exported.

       -x     Scripts too - this causes the program to also return process id's of shells running the named scripts.

       -o omitpid
              Tells pidof to omit processes with that process id. The special pid %PPID can be used to name the parent process of the pidof program, in other words the calling shell or shell script.

EXIT STATUS
       0      At least one program was found with the requested name.

       1      No program was found with the requested name.

NOTES
       pidof is actually the same program as killall5; the program behaves according to the name under which it is called.

       When  pidof  is  invoked with a full pathname to the program it should find the pid of, it is reasonably safe. Otherwise it is possible that it returns pids of running programs that happen to
       have the same name as the program you're after but are actually other programs. Note that that the executable name of running processes is calculated with readlink(2), so  symbolic  links  to
       executables will also match.
