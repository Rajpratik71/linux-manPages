NAME
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace - Analyzes C/C++ backtrace, generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies crash function in problem directory DIR.

SYNOPSIS
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace [-v] [-d DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       The tool reads a file named backtrace from problem directory, generates duplication hash, backtrace rating, and identifies crash function. Then it saves this data as new elements duphash, rating,
       crash_function in this problem directory.

   Integration with libreport events
       abrt-action-analyze-backtrace can be used as a secondary analyzer, after backtrace has been generated. The data generated by abrt-action-analyze-backtrace is useful for reporting the crash to bug
       databases: rating makes it possible to prevent reporting of bugs with low quality (non-informative) backtraces, duplication hash is used to find already filed bugs about similar crashes.

       Example usage in report_event.conf:

           EVENT=analyze analyzer=CCpp
                   abrt-action-generate-backtrace || exit $?
                   abrt-action-analyze-backtrace

OPTIONS
       -d DIR
           Path to problem directory.

       -v
           Be more verbose. Can be given multiple times.
