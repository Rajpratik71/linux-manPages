NAME
       ds-replcheck - Performs replication synchronization report between two replicas


SYNOPSIS
       ds-replcheck [-h] [-o FILE] [-D BINDDN] [[-w BINDPW] [-W]] [-m MURL]
                    [-r RURL] [-b SUFFIX] [-l LAG] [-Z CERTDIR]
                    [-i IGNORE] [-p PAGESIZE] [-M MLDIF] [-R RLDIF]


DESCRIPTION
       ds-replcheck has two operating modes: offline - which compares two LDIF files (generated by db2ldif -r), and online mode - which queries each server to gather the entries for comparisions.  The tool
       reports on missing entries, entry inconsistencies, tombstones, conflict entries, database RUVs, and entry counts.
