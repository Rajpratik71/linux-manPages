NAME
       ant - a Java based make tool.

SYNOPSIS
       ant [OPTIONS] [TARGET [TARGET2 [TARGET3] ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Like  make  ant  is a tool by which projects can be build. But unlike it, ant is based on Java
       which means it will run on every platform for which a Java Virtual Machine is available.  This
       makes it a great tool for building Java software.

       By default it takes information from build.xml which describes the targets.
