NAME
       ecryptfsd - user-space eCryptfs daemon.

DESCRIPTION
       ecryptfsd  is  a  userspace  daemon that runs as the user performing file operations under the eCryptfs mount point. It services public key
       requests from the eCryptfs kernel module; these requests are sent via /dev/ecryptfs on file open events. ecryptfsd only  needs  to  be  run
       when a mount is done with a public key module.

       The daemon can be started simply by running ecryptfsd. ecryptfsd will register itself with the kernel as the daemon that should service all
       eCryptfs filesystem requests done under the context of the user who runs the daemon.
