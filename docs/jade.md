DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents briefly the jade command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution (but may be used
       by others), because the original program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in HTML format; see below.

       jade is an implementation of the DSSSL style language.  The current version is 1.1.

OPTIONS
       For a complete description, see the html files.

SEE ALSO
       The programs are documented fully in /usr/share/doc/jade/jade.htm
