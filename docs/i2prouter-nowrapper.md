NAME
       i2prouter-nowrapper - start the I2P router

SYNOPSIS
       i2prouter-nowrapper

DESCRIPTION
       Start  the  I2P  router, without the service wrapper.  This means the router will not restart if it crashes.  Also, it will use the default
       memory size, which may not be enough for I2P.

       You should really use the i2prouter(1) script instead.  There are no options.  To stop the router, use your browser to  access  the  router
       console ⟨http://localhost:7657/⟩.

REPORTING BUGS
       Please enter a ticket on the I2P trac page ⟨https://trac.i2p2.de/⟩.
