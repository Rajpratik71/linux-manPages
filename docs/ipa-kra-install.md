NAME
       ipa-kra-install - Install a KRA on a server

SYNOPSIS
   DOMAIN LEVEL 0
       ipa-kra-install [OPTION]... [replica_file]

   DOMAIN LEVEL 1
       ipa-kra-install [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a KRA as an IPA-managed service. This requires that the IPA server is already installed and configured, including a CA.

       The KRA (Key Recovery Authority) is a component used to securely store secrets such as passwords, symmetric keys and private asymmetric keys.  It is used as the back-end repository for the IPA Pass‚Äê
       word Vault.

       In a domain at domain level 0, ipa-kra-install can be run without replica_file to add KRA to the existing CA, or with replica_file to install the KRA service on the  replica.   ipa-kra-install  will
       contact the CA to determine if a KRA has already been installed on another replica, and if so, will exit indicating that a replica_file is required.

       The  replica_file  is  created  using  the  ipa-replica-prepare utility.  A new replica_file should be generated on the master IPA server after the KRA has been installed and configured, so that the
       replica_file will contain the master KRA configuration and system certificates.

       In a domain at domain level 1, ipa-kra-install can be used to add KRA to the existing CA, or to install the KRA service on a replica, and does not require any replica file.

       KRA can only be removed along with the entire server using ipa-server-install --uninstall.
