NAME
       arp-scan - The ARP scanner

SYNOPSIS
       arp-scan [options] [hosts...]

       Target hosts must be specified on the command line unless the --file option is given, in which case the targets are read from the specified
       file instead, or the --localnet option is used, in which case the targets are generated from the network interface IP address and netmask.

       You will need to be root, or arp-scan must be SUID root, in order to run arp-scan, because the functions that it uses  to  read  and  write
       packets require root privilege.

       The target hosts can be specified as IP addresses or hostnames.  You can also specify the target as IPnetwork/bits (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) to
       specify all hosts in the given network (network and broadcast addresses included), IPstart-IPend (e.g. 192.168.1.3-192.168.1.27) to specify
       all hosts in the inclusive range, or IPnetwork:NetMask (e.g. 192.168.1.0:255.255.255.0) to specify all hosts in the given network and mask.

DESCRIPTION
       arp-scan  sends ARP packets to hosts on the local network and displays any responses that are received. The network interface to use can be
       specified with the --interface option. If this option is not present, arp-scan will search the system interface list for  the  lowest  num‐
       bered,  configured  up  interface  (excluding  loopback).   By  default,  the  ARP  packets  are  sent  to  the Ethernet broadcast address,
       ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff, but that can be changed with the --destaddr option.

       The target hosts to scan may be specified in one of three ways: by specifying the targets on the command line; by specifying  a  file  con‐
       taining  the targets with the --file option; or by specifying the --localnet option which causes all possible hosts on the network attached
       to the interface (as defined by the interface address and mask) to be scanned. For hosts specified on the command line, or with the  --file
       option,  you  can  use  either IP addresses or hostnames.  You can also use network specifications IPnetwork/bits, IPstart-IPend, or IPnet‐
       work:NetMask.

       The list of target hosts is stored in memory.  Each host in this list uses 28 bytes of memory, so scanning a Class-B network (65,536 hosts)
       requires about 1.75MB of memory for the list, and scanning a Class-A (16,777,216 hosts) requires about 448MB.

       arp-scan  supports Ethernet and 802.11 wireless networks. It could also support token ring and FDDI, but they have not been tested. It does
       not support serial links such as PPP or SLIP, because ARP is not supported on them.

       The ARP protocol is a layer-2 (datalink layer) protocol that is used to determine a host's  layer-2  address  given  its  layer-3  (network
       layer)  address.  ARP  was  designed to work with any layer-2 and layer-3 address format, but the most common use is to map IP addresses to
       Ethernet hardware addresses, and this is what arp-scan supports. ARP only operates on the local network, and cannot be routed. Although the
       ARP  protocol makes use of IP addresses, it is not an IP-based protocol and arp-scan can be used on an interface that is not configured for
       IP.

       ARP is only used by IPv4 hosts. IPv6 uses NDP (neighbour discovery protocol) instead, which is a different protocol and is not supported by
       arp-scan.

       One  ARP  packet  is  sent for each for each target host, with the target protocol address (the ar$tpa field) set to the IP address of this
       host. If a host does not respond, then the ARP packet will be re-sent once more.  The maximum number of retries can  be  changed  with  the
       --retry  option.   Reducing  the number of retries will reduce the scanning time at the possible risk of missing some results due to packet
       loss.

       You can specify the bandwidth that arp-scan will use for the outgoing ARP packets with the --bandwidth option.  By default, it uses a band‐
       width  of  256000 bits per second. Increasing the bandwidth will reduce the scanning time, but setting the bandwidth too high may result in
       an ARP storm which can disrupt network operation.  Also, setting the bandwidth too high can send packets faster than the network  interface
       can  transmit  them,  which  will  eventually  fill the kernel's transmit buffer resulting in the error message: No buffer space available.
       Another way to specify the outgoing ARP packet rate is with the --interval option, which is an alternative way to modify the same  underly‐
       ing parameter.

       The time taken to perform a single-pass scan (i.e. with --retry=1) is given by:

       time = n*i + t + o

       Where  n  is the number of hosts in the list, i is the time interval between packets (specified with --interval, or calculated from --band‐
       width), t is the timeout value (specified with --timeout) and o is the overhead time taken to load the targets into the list and  read  the
       MAC/Vendor  mapping  files.  For small lists of hosts, the timeout value will dominate, but for large lists the packet interval is the most
       important value.

       With 65,536 hosts, the default bandwidth of 256,000 bits/second (which results in a packet interval of 2ms), the default timeout of  500ms,
       and  a single pass ( --retry=1), and assuming an overhead of 1 second, the scan would take 65536*0.002 + 0.5 + 1 = 132.57 seconds, or about
       2 minutes 13 seconds.

       Any part of the outgoing ARP packet may be modified through the use of the various --arpXXX options.  The use of some of these options  may
       make  the outgoing ARP packet non RFC compliant. Different operating systems handle the various non standard ARP packets in different ways,
       and this may be used to fingerprint these systems.  See arp-fingerprint(1) for information about a script which uses these options to  fin‐
       gerprint the target operating system.

       The table below summarises the options that change the outgoing ARP packet. In this table, the Field column gives the ARP packet field name
       from RFC 826, Bits specifies the number of bits in the field, Option shows the arp-scan option to modify this field, and  Notes  gives  the
       default value and any other notes.

       └───────┴──────┴──────────┴─────────────────────────────────────┘
       The  most commonly used outgoing ARP packet option is --arpspa, which sets the source IP address in the ARP packet.  This option allows the
       outgoing ARP packet to use a different source IP address from the outgoing interface address.  With this option it is possible to use  arp-
       scan  on an interface with no IP address configured, which can be useful if you want to ensure that the testing host does not interact with
       the network being tested.

       Warning: Setting ar$spa to the destination IP address can disrupt some operating systems, as they assume there is an IP  address  clash  if
       they receive an ARP request for their own address.

       It is also possible to change the values in the Ethernet frame header that precedes the ARP packet in the outgoing packets. The table below
       summarises the options that change values in the Ethernet frame header.

       The most commonly used outgoing Ethernet frame option is --destaddr, which sets the  destination  Ethernet  address  for  the  ARP  packet.
       --prototype is not often used, because it will cause the packet to be interpreted as a different Ethernet protocol.

       Any ARP responses that are received are displayed in the following format:

       <IP Address>   <Hardware Address>   <Vendor Details>

       Where  IP  Address  is  the  IP  address of the responding target, Hardware Address is its Ethernet hardware address (also known as the MAC
       address) and Vendor Details are the vendor details, decoded from the hardware address.  The output fields are separated  by  a  single  tab
       character.

       The responses are displayed in the order they are received, which is not always the same order as the requests were sent because some hosts
       may respond faster than others.

       The vendor decoding uses the files ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt and mac-vendor.txt, which are supplied with arp-scan.  The  ieee-oui.txt  and
       ieee-iab.txt  files  are  generated from the OUI and IAB data on the IEEE website at http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/ieee-oui.txt and
       http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/iab.txt.  The Perl scripts get-oui and get-iab, which are included in the arp-scan  package,  can  be
       used  to update these files with the latest data from the IEEE website.  The mac-vendor.txt file contains other MAC to Vendor mappings that
       are not covered by the IEEE OUI and IAB files, and can be used to add custom mappings.

       Almost all hosts that support IP will respond to arp-scan if they receive an ARP packet with the target protocol address  (ar$tpa)  set  to
       their  IP  address.   This  includes firewalls and other hosts with IP filtering that drop all IP traffic from the testing system. For this
       reason, arp-scan is a useful tool to quickly determine all the active IP hosts on a given Ethernet network segment.

OPTIONS
       Where an option takes a value, that value is specified as a letter in angle brackets. The  letter  indicates  the  type  of  data  that  is
       expected:

       <s>    A character string, e.g. --file=hostlist.txt.

       <i>    An  integer,  which  can  be  specified  as  a  decimal number or as a hexadecimal number if preceded with 0x, e.g. --arppro=2048 or
              --arpro=0x0800.

       <f>    A floating point decimal number, e.g. --backoff=1.5.

       <m>    An Ethernet MAC address, which can be specified either in the format 01:23:45:67:89:ab, or as 01-23-45-67-89-ab. The alphabetic  hex
              characters may be either upper or lower case. E.g. --arpsha=01:23:45:67:89:ab.

       <a>    An IPv4 address, e.g. --arpspa=10.0.0.1

       <h>    Binary  data  specified  as a hexadecimal string, which should not include a leading 0x. The alphabetic hex characters may be either
              upper or lower case. E.g. --padding=aaaaaaaaaaaa

       <x>    Something else. See the description of the option for details.

       --help or -h
              Display this usage message and exit.

       --file=<s> or -f <s>
              Read hostnames or addresses from the specified file instead of from the command line. One name or IP address per line. Use  "-"  for
              standard input.

       --localnet or -l
              Generate addresses from network interface configuration.  Use the network interface IP address and network mask to generate the list
              of target host addresses.  The list will include the network and broadcast addresses, so an interface address of 10.0.0.1 with  net‐
              mask  255.255.255.0 would generate 256 target hosts from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 inclusive.  If you use this option, you cannot spec‐
              ify the --file option or specify any target hosts on the command line.  The interface specifications are taken  from  the  interface
              that arp-scan will use, which can be changed with the --interface option.

       --retry=<i> or -r <i>
              Set total number of attempts per host to <i>, default=2.

       --timeout=<i> or -t <i>
              Set  initial  per host timeout to <i> ms, default=500.  This timeout is for the first packet sent to each host.  subsequent timeouts
              are multiplied by the backoff factor which is set with --backoff.

       --interval=<x> or -i <x>
              Set minimum packet interval to <x>.  This controls the outgoing bandwidth usage by limiting the rate at which packets can  be  sent.
              The  packet  interval will be no smaller than this number.  If you want to use up to a given bandwidth, then it is easier to use the
              --bandwidth option instead.  The interval specified is in milliseconds by default, or in microseconds if  "u"  is  appended  to  the
              value.

       --bandwidth=<x> or -B <x>
              Set  desired outbound bandwidth to <x>, default=256000.  The value is in bits per second by default. If you append "K" to the value,
              then the units are kilobits per sec; and if you append "M" to the value, the units are megabits per second.  The "K"  and  "M"  suf‐
              fixes  represent the decimal, not binary, multiples. So 64K is 64000, not 65536.  You cannot specify both --interval and --bandwidth
              because they are just different ways to change the same underlying parameter.

       --backoff=<f> or -b <f>
              Set timeout backoff factor to <f>, default=1.50.  The per-host timeout is multiplied by this factor after each timeout. So,  if  the
              number  of  retries is 3, the initial per-host timeout is 500ms and the backoff factor is 1.5, then the first timeout will be 500ms,
              the second 750ms and the third 1125ms.

       --verbose or -v
              Display verbose progress messages.  Use more than once for greater effect:

              1 - Display the network address and mask used when the --localnet option is specified, display any nonzero packet  padding,  display
              packets received from unknown hosts, and show when each pass through the list completes.

              2  -  Show  each  packet sent and received, when entries are removed from the list, the pcap filter string, and counts of MAC/Vendor
              mapping entries.

              3 - Display the host list before scanning starts.

       --version or -V
              Display program version and exit.

       --random or -R
              Randomise the host list.  This option randomises the order of the hosts in the host list, so the ARP packets are sent to  the  hosts
              in a random order. It uses the Knuth shuffle algorithm.

       --numeric or -N
              IP addresses only, no hostnames.  With this option, all hosts must be specified as IP addresses. Hostnames are not permitted. No DNS
              lookups will be performed.

       --snap=<i> or -n <i>
              Set the pcap snap length to <i>. Default=64.  This specifies the frame capture length. This length includes  the  data-link  header.
              The default is normally sufficient.

       --interface=<s> or -I <s>
              Use network interface <s>.  If this option is not specified, arp-scan will search the system interface list for the lowest numbered,
              configured up interface (excluding loopback).  The interface specified must support ARP.

       --quiet or -q
              Only display minimal output.  If this option is specified, then only the minimum information is displayed. With this option, the OUI
              files are not used.

       --ignoredups or -g
              Don't display duplicate packets.  By default, duplicate packets are displayed and are flagged with "(DUP: n)".

       --ouifile=<s> or -O <s>
              Use IEEE Ethernet OUI to vendor mapping file <s>.  If this option is not specified, the default filename is ieee-oui.txt in the cur‐
              rent directory. If that is not found, then the file /usr/local/share/arp-scan/ieee-oui.txt is used.

       --iabfile=<s> or -O <s>
              Use IEEE Ethernet IAB to vendor mapping file <s>.  If this option is not specified, the default filename is ieee-iab.txt in the cur‐
              rent directory. If that is not found, then the file /usr/local/share/arp-scan/ieee-iab.txt is used.

       --macfile=<s> or -O <s>
              Use  custom Ethernet MAC to vendor mapping file <s>.  If this option is not specified, the default filename is mac-vendor.txt in the
              current directory. If that is not found, then the file /usr/local/share/arp-scan/mac-vendor.txt is used.

       --srcaddr=<m> or -S <m>
              Set the source Ethernet MAC address to <m>.  This sets the 48-bit hardware address in the Ethernet frame  header  for  outgoing  ARP
              packets.  It  does  not  change the hardware address in the ARP packet, see --arpsha for details on how to change that address.  The
              default is the Ethernet address of the outgoing interface.

       --destaddr=<m> or -T <m>
              Send the packets to Ethernet MAC address <m> This sets the 48-bit destination address in the Ethernet frame header.  The default  is
              the  broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.  Most operating systems will also respond if the ARP request is sent to their MAC address,
              or to a multicast address that they are listening on.

       --arpsha=<m> or -u <m>
              Use <m> as the ARP source Ethernet address This sets the 48-bit ar$sha field in the ARP packet  It  does  not  change  the  hardware
              address  in  the  frame  header, see --srcaddr for details on how to change that address. The default is the Ethernet address of the
              outgoing interface.

       --arptha=<m> or -w <m>
              Use <m> as the ARP target Ethernet address This sets the 48-bit ar$tha field in the ARP packet The default  is  zero,  because  this
              field is not used for ARP request packets.

       --prototype=<i> or -y <i>
              Set the Ethernet protocol type to <i>, default=0x0806.  This sets the 16-bit protocol type field in the Ethernet frame header.  Set‐
              ting this to a non-default value will result in the packet being ignored by the target, or sent to the wrong protocol stack.

       --arphrd=<i> or -H <i>
              Use <i> for the ARP hardware type, default=1.  This sets the 16-bit ar$hrd  field  in  the  ARP  packet.   The  normal  value  is  1
              (ARPHRD_ETHER). Most, but not all, operating systems will also respond to 6 (ARPHRD_IEEE802). A few systems respond to any value.

       --arppro=<i> or -p <i>
              Use  <i>  for  the  ARP protocol type, default=0x0800.  This sets the 16-bit ar$pro field in the ARP packet.  Most operating systems
              only respond to 0x0800 (IPv4) but some will respond to other values as well.

       --arphln=<i> or -a <i>
              Set the hardware address length to <i>, default=6.  This sets the 8-bit ar$hln field in the ARP packet.  It sets the claimed  length
              of  the  hardware  address in the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other than the default will make the packet non RFC compliant.
              Some operating systems may still respond to it though.  Note that the actual lengths of the ar$sha and  ar$tha  fields  in  the  ARP
              packet are not changed by this option; it only changes the ar$hln field.

       --arppln=<i> or -P <i>
              Set  the protocol address length to <i>, default=4.  This sets the 8-bit ar$pln field in the ARP packet.  It sets the claimed length
              of the protocol address in the ARP packet. Setting it to any value other than the default will make the packet  non  RFC  compliant.
              Some  operating  systems  may  still  respond to it though.  Note that the actual lengths of the ar$spa and ar$tpa fields in the ARP
              packet are not changed by this option; it only changes the ar$pln field.

       --arpop=<i> or -o <i>
              Use <i> for the ARP operation, default=1.  This sets the 16-bit ar$op field in the ARP packet.  Most  operating  systems  will  only
              respond to the value 1 (ARPOP_REQUEST). However, some systems will respond to other values as well.

       --arpspa=<a> or -s <a>
              Use  <a>  as the source IP address.  The address should be specified in dotted quad format; or the literal string "dest", which sets
              the source address to be the same as the target host address.  This sets the 32-bit ar$spa field in the ARP packet.  Some  operating
              systems check this, and will only respond if the source address is within the network of the receiving interface. Others don't care,
              and will respond to any source address.  By default, the outgoing interface address is used.

              WARNING: Setting ar$spa to the destination IP address can disrupt some operating systems, as they assume  there  is  an  IP  address
              clash if they receive an ARP request for their own address.

       --padding=<h> or -A <h>
              Specify padding after packet data.  Set the padding data to hex value <h>. This data is appended to the end of the ARP packet, after
              the data.  Most, if not all, operating systems will ignore any padding. The default is no padding, although the Ethernet  driver  on
              the sending system may pad the packet to the minimum Ethernet frame length.

       --llc or -L
              Use  RFC  1042  LLC  framing with SNAP.  This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to use IEEE 802.2 framing with a SNAP header as
              described in RFC 1042. The default is to use Ethernet-II framing.  arp-scan will decode and display received ARP packets  in  either
              Ethernet-II or IEEE 802.2 formats irrespective of this option.

       --vlan=<i> or -Q <i>
              Use  802.1Q tagging with VLAN id <i>.  This option causes the outgoing ARP packets to use 802.1Q VLAN tagging with a VLAN ID of <i>,
              which should be in the range 0 to 4095 inclusive.  arp-scan will always decode and display received ARP  packets  in  802.1Q  format
              irrespective of this option.

       --pcapsavefile=<s> or -W <s>
              Write received packets to pcap savefile <s>.  This option causes received ARP responses to be written to the specified pcap savefile
              as well as being decoded and displayed. This savefile can be analysed with programs that understand the pcap file  format,  such  as
              "tcpdump" and "wireshark".

       --rtt or -D
              Display the packet round-trip time.
