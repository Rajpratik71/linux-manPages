NAME
     bsdcat â€” expand files to standard output

SYNOPSIS
     bsdcat [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
     bsdcat expands files to standard output.

OPTIONS
     bsdcat typically takes a filename as an argument or reads standard input when used in a pipe. In
     both cases decompressed data it written to standard output.

EXAMPLES
     To decompress a file:

           bsdcat example.txt.gz > example.txt

     To decompress standard input in a pipe:

           cat example.txt.gz | bsdcat > example.txt

     Both examples achieve the same results - a decompressed file by redirecting output.
