tpm2_getekcertificate(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     tpm2_getekcertificate(1)

NAME
       tpm2_getekcertificate(1)  -  Retrieve  the  Endorsement key Certificate for the TPM endorsement key from the TPM manufacturer’s endorsement
       certificate hosting server.

SYNOPSIS
       tpm2_getekcertificate [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENT]

DESCRIPTION
       tpm2_getekcertificate(1) - Retrieve the Endorsement key Certificate for the TPM endorsement key from  the  TPM  manufacturer’s  endorsement
       certificate hosting server.  The argument specifies the URL address for the ek certificate portal.

OPTIONS
       • -o, --ek-certificate=FILE or STDOUT:

         The fileto save the Endorsement key certificate retrieved from the TPM manufacturer provisioning server.  Defaults to stdout if not spec‐
         ified.

       • -X, --allow-unverified:

         Specifies to attempt connecting with the TPM manufacturer provisioning server without verifying server certificate.

         WARNING: This option should be used only on platforms with older CA certificates.

       • -u, --ek-public=FILE:

         Specifies the file path for the endorsement key public portion in tss format.

       • -x, --offline:

         This flags the tool to operate in an offline mode.  In that the certificates can be retrieved for supplied ek public that do  not  belong
         to  the platform the tool is run on.  Useful in factory provisioning of multiple platforms that are not individually connected to the In‐
         ternet.  In such a scenario a single Internet facing provisioning server can utilize this tool in this mode.

       • ARGUMENT the command line argument specifies the URL address for the ek certificate portal.

COMMON OPTIONS
       This collection of options are common to many programs and provide information that many users may expect.

       • -h, --help=[man|no-man]: Display the tools manpage.  By default, it attempts to invoke the manpager for the  tool,  however,  on  failure
         will  output a short tool summary.  This is the same behavior if the “man” option argument is specified, however if explicit “man” is re‐
         quested, the tool will provide errors from man on stderr.  If the “no-man” option if specified, or the manpager fails, the short  options
         will be output to stdout.

         To successfully use the manpages feature requires the manpages to be installed or on MANPATH, See man(1) for more details.

       • -v, --version: Display version information for this tool, supported tctis and exit.

       • -V,  --verbose:  Increase  the information that the tool prints to the console during its execution.  When using this option the file and
         line number are printed.

       • -Q, --quiet: Silence normal tool output to stdout.

       • -Z, --enable-errata: Enable the application of errata fixups.  Useful if an errata fixup needs to be applied to commands sent to the TPM.
         Defining the environment TPM2TOOLS_ENABLE_ERRATA is equivalent.  information many users may expect.

TCTI Configuration
       The  TCTI or “Transmission Interface” is the communication mechanism with the TPM.  TCTIs can be changed for communication with TPMs across
       different mediums.

       To control the TCTI, the tools respect:

       1. The command line option -T or --tcti

       2. The environment variable: TPM2TOOLS_TCTI.

       Note: The command line option always overrides the environment variable.

       The current known TCTIs are:

       • tabrmd - The resource manager, called tabrmd (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-abrmd).  Note that tabrmd and abrmd as  a  tcti  name
         are synonymous.

       • mssim - Typically used for communicating to the TPM software simulator.

       • device - Used when talking directly to a TPM device file.

       • none  -  Do not initalize a connection with the TPM.  Some tools allow for off-tpm options and thus support not using a TCTI.  Tools that
         do not support it will error when attempted to be used without a TCTI connection.  Does not support ANY options and MUST BE presented  as
         the exact text of “none”.

       The arguments to either the command line option or the environment variable are in the form:

       <tcti-name>:<tcti-option-config>

       Specifying  an  empty  string for either the <tcti-name> or <tcti-option-config> results in the default being used for that portion respec‐
       tively.

   TCTI Defaults
       When a TCTI is not specified, the default TCTI is searched for using dlopen(3) semantics.  The tools will search  for  tabrmd,  device  and
       mssim  TCTIs  IN  THAT  ORDER and USE THE FIRST ONE FOUND.  You can query what TCTI will be chosen as the default by using the -v option to
       print the version information.  The “default-tcti” key-value pair will indicate which of the aforementioned TCTIs is the default.

   Custom TCTIs
       Any TCTI that implements the dynamic TCTI interface can be loaded.  The tools internally use dlopen(3), and the raw tcti-name value is used
       for the lookup.  Thus, this could be a path to the shared library, or a library name as understood by dlopen(3) semantics.

TCTI OPTIONS
       This collection of options are used to configure the various known TCTI modules available:

       • device: For the device TCTI, the TPM character device file for use by the device TCTI can be specified.  The default is /dev/tpm0.

         Example: -T device:/dev/tpm0 or export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“device:/dev/tpm0”

       • mssim:  For  the  mssim  TCTI,  the  domain  name  or IP address and port number used by the simulator can be specified.  The default are
         127.0.0.1 and 2321.

         Example: -T mssim:host=localhost,port=2321 or export TPM2TOOLS_TCTI=“mssim:host=localhost,port=2321”

       • abrmd: For the abrmd TCTI, the configuration string format is a series of simple key value pairs separated by a `,' character.  Each  key
         and value string are separated by a `=' character.

         • TCTI abrmd supports two keys:

           1. `bus_name' : The name of the tabrmd service on the bus (a string).

           2. `bus_type' : The type of the dbus instance (a string) limited to `session' and `system'.

         Specify the tabrmd tcti name and a config string of bus_name=com.example.FooBar:

                \--tcti=tabrmd:bus_name=com.example.FooBar

         Specify the default (abrmd) tcti and a config string of bus_type=session:

                \--tcti:bus_type=session

         NOTE: abrmd and tabrmd are synonymous.  the various known TCTI modules.

NOTES
       When  the  verbose  option  is  specified,  additional  curl  debugging  information  is  provided  by  setting  the curl mode verbose, see
       <https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_VERBOSE.html> for more information.
