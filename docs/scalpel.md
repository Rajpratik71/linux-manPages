NAME
       scalpel - Recover files using a header/footer database

SYNOPSIS
       scalpel [-b] [-c <file>] [-d] [-h] [-i <file>] [-m <blocksize>] [-n] [-o <dir>] [-O] [-p] [-r] [-s <num>] [-t] [-u] [-V] [-v] [FILES]...

DESCRIPTION
       Recover files from a disk image or raw block device based on headers and footers specified by the user.

       -b     Carve files even if defined footers aren't discovered within maximum carve size for file type [foremost 0.69 compat mode]

       -c file
              Chooses which configuration file to use. If this option is omitted, then "scalpel.conf" in the current directory is used. The format
              for the configuration file is described in the default configuration file "scalpel.conf".  See the CONFIGURATION FILE section  below
              for more information.

       -d     Generate header/footer database; will bypass certain optimizations and discover all footers, so performance suffers.  Doesn't affect
              the set of files carved.  **EXPERIMENTAL**

       -m     Generate/update carve coverage blockmap file.  The first 32bit unsigned int in the file identifies the block size.  Thereafter  each
              32bit  unsigned  int entry in the blockmap file corresponds to one block in the image file.  Each entry counts how many carved files
              contain this block. Requires more memory and disk.  **EXPERIMENTAL**

       -h     Show a help screen and exit.

       -i file
              file is used as a list of input files to examine. Each line in the specified file should contain a single filename.

       -o directory
              Recovered files are written to the directory directory.   Scalpel requires that this directory be either empty or  not  exist.   The
              directory will be created if necessary.

       -O     Don't  organize carved files by type. Default is to organize carved files into subdirectories to make previewing of large numbers of
              carved files easier.

       -p     Perform image file preview; audit log indicates which files would have been carved, but no files are actually carved.

       -q clustersize
              Carve only when header is cluster-aligned.

       -r     Find only first of overlapping headers/footers [foremost 0.69 compat mode]

       -s number
              Skips number bytes in each input file before beginning the search for file headers and footers.

       -t     Set directory for coverage blockmap.  **EXPERIMENTAL**

       -u     Use carve coverage blockmap when carving.  Carve only sections of the image whose entries in the blockmap are 0.   These  areas  are
              treated as contiguous regions.  **EXPERIMENTAL**

       -V     Show copyright information and exit.

       -v     Enables verbose mode. This causes copious amounts of debugging information to be output.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  configuration  file is used to control the types of files Scalpel will attempt to carve.  A sample configuration file, "scalpel.conf",
       is included with this distribution. For each file type, the configuration file describes the  file's  extension,  whether  the  header  and
       footer  are  case  sensitive,  the maximum file size, and the header and footer for the file. The footer field is optional, but the header,
       size, case sensitivity, and extension fields are required.

       Important note: The default configuration file has all supported file patterns commented out--you must  edit  this  before  before  running
       Scalpel.

       Any line in the configuration file that begins with a pound sign is considered a comment and ignored.

       Headers and footers are decoded before use. To specify a value in hexadecimal use \x[0-f][0-f], and for octal use \[1-9][1-9][1-9].  Spaces
       can be represented by \s. Example: "\x4F\123\I\sCCI" decodes to "OSI CCI".

       To match any single character (aka a wildcard) use a '?'. If you need to search for the '?' character, you will need to change  the  'wild‐
       card'  line *and* every occurrence of the old wildcard character in the configuration file, including those appearing in hex and octal val‐
       ues. '?' is equal to \x3f and \063.

AUTHORS
       Written by Golden G. Richard III.  The first version of Scalpel was based on foremost 0.69, which was written by Special Agent Kris Kendall
       and Special Agent Jesse Kornblum of the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
       It is currently not possible to carve physical block devices directly using the Windows version of Scalpel.  This is a limitation that will
       be removed in a future release of Scalpel.

REPORTING BUGS
       When submitting a bug report, please include a description of the problem, how you found it, and your contact information.
