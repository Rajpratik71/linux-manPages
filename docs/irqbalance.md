NAME
       irqbalance - distribute hardware interrupts across processors on a multiprocessor system

SYNOPSIS
       irqbalance

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of irqbalance is to distribute hardware interrupts across processors on a multiprocessor system in order to increase performance.

OPTIONS
       -o, --oneshot
              Causes irqbalance to be run once, after which the daemon exits.

       -d, --debug
              Causes irqbalance to print extra debug information.  Implies --foreground.

       -f, --foreground
              Causes irqbalance to run in the foreground (without --debug).

       -j, --journal
              Enables log output optimized for systemd-journal.

       -p, --powerthresh=<threshold>
              Set  the threshold at which we attempt to move a CPU into powersave mode If more than <threshold> CPUs are more than 1 standard deviation below the average CPU softirq workload, and no
              CPUs are more than 1 standard deviation above (and have more than 1 IRQ assigned to them), attempt to place 1 CPU in powersave mode.  In powersave mode, a CPU will not  have  any  IRQs
              balanced to it, in an effort to prevent that CPU from waking up without need.

       -i, --banirq=<irqnum>
              Add  the  specified IRQ to the set of banned IRQs. irqbalance will not affect the affinity of any IRQs on the banned list, allowing them to be specified manually.  This option is adda‐
              tive and can be specified multiple times. For example to ban IRQs 43 and 44 from balancing, use the following command line: irqbalance --banirq=43 --banirq=44

       --deepestcache=<integer>
              This allows a user to specify the cache level at which irqbalance partitions cache domains.  Specifying a deeper cache may allow a greater  degree  of  flexibility  for  irqbalance  to
              assign  IRQ  affinity  to  achieve  greater  performance increases, but setting a cache depth too large on some systems (specifically where all CPUs on a system share the deepest cache
              level), will cause irqbalance to see balancing as unnecessary.  irqbalance --deepestcache=2

       The default value for deepestcache is 2.

       -l, --policyscript=<script>
              When specified, the referenced script will execute once for each discovered IRQ, with the sysfs device path and IRQ number passed as arguments.  Note that the device path argument will
              point  to  the  parent  directory from which the IRQ attributes directory may be directly opened.  The script may specify zero or more key=value pairs that will guide irqbalance in the
              management of that IRQ.  Key=value pairs are printed by the script on stdout and will be captured and interpreted by irqbalance.  Irqbalance expects a zero exit code from the  provided
              utility.  Recognized key=value pairs are:

       ban=[true | false]

       Directs irqbalance to exclude the passed in IRQ from balancing.

       balance_level=[none | package | cache | core]
              This  allows  a  user  to override the balance level of a given IRQ.  By default the balance level is determined automatically based on the pci device class of the device that owns the
              IRQ.

       numa_node=<integer>
              This allows a user to override the NUMA node that sysfs indicates a given device IRQ is local to.  Often, systems will not specify this information in ACPI, and as a result devices are
              considered  equidistant from all NUMA nodes in a system.  This option allows for that hardware provided information to be overridden, so that irqbalance can bias IRQ affinity for these
              devices toward its most local node.  Note that specifying a -1 here forces irqbalance to consider an interrupt from a device to be equidistant from all nodes.

       -s, --pid=<file>
              Have irqbalance write its process id to the specified file.  By default no pidfile is written.  The written pidfile is automatically unlinked when irqbalance exits. It is ignored  when
              used with --debug or --foreground.

       -t, --interval=<time>
              Set the measurement time for irqbalance.  irqbalance will sleep for <time> seconds between samples of the irq load on the system cpus. Defaults to 10.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT
              Same as --oneshot.

       IRQBALANCE_DEBUG
              Same as --debug.

       IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
              Provides a mask of CPUs which irqbalance should ignore and never assign interrupts to.

SIGNALS
       SIGHUP Forces a rescan of the available IRQs and system topology.

API
       irqbalance  is  able  to communicate via socket and return it's current assignment tree and setup, as well as set new settings based on sent values. Socket is abstract, with a name in form of
       irqbalance<PID>.sock , where <PID> is the process ID of irqbalance instance to communicate with.  Possible values to send:

       stats  Retrieve assignment tree of IRQs to CPUs, in recursive manner. For each CPU node in tree, it's type, number, load and whether the save mode is active are sent. For  each  assigned  IRQ
              type, it's number, load, number of IRQs since last rebalancing and it's class are sent. Refer to types.h file for explanation of defines.

       setup  Get the current value of sleep interval, mask of banned CPUs and and list of banned IRQs.

       settings sleep <s>
              Set new value of sleep interval, <s> >= 1.

       settings cpus <cpu_number1> <cpu_number2> ...
              Ban listed CPUs from IRQ handling, all old values of banned CPUs are forgotten.

       settings ban irqs <irq1> <irq2> ...
              Ban listed IRQs from being balanced, all old values of banned IRQs are forgotten.

       irqbalance checks SCM_CREDENTIALS of sender (only root user is allowed to interact).  Based on chosen tools, ancillary message with credentials needs to be sent with request.
