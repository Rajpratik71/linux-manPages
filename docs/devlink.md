NAME
       devlink - Devlink tool

SYNOPSIS
       devlink [ OPTIONS ] OBJECT { COMMAND | help }

       devlink [ -force ] -batch filename

       OBJECT := { dev | port | monitor }

       OPTIONS := { -V[ersion] | -n[no-nice-names] } -j[json] } -p[pretty] }

OPTIONS
       -V, --Version
              Print the version of the devlink utility and exit.

       -b, -batch <FILENAME>
              Read commands from provided file or standard input and invoke them.  First failure will cause termination of devlink.

       -force Don't terminate devlink on errors in batch mode.  If there were any errors during execution of the commands, the application return code will be non zero.

       -n, --no-nice-names
              Turn off printing out nice names, for example netdevice ifnames instead of devlink port identification.

       -j, --json
              Generate JSON output.

       -p, --pretty
              When combined with -j generate a pretty JSON output.

   OBJECT
       dev    - devlink device.

       port   - devlink port.

       monitor
              - watch for netlink messages.

   COMMAND
       Specifies the action to perform on the object.  The set of possible actions depends on the object type.  As a rule, it is possible to show (or list ) objects, but some objects do not allow
       all of these operations or have some additional commands. The help command is available for all objects. It prints out a list of available commands and argument syntax conventions.

       If no command is given, some default command is assumed.  Usually it is list or, if the objects of this class cannot be listed, help.

EXIT STATUS
       Exit status is 0 if command was successful or a positive integer upon failure.
