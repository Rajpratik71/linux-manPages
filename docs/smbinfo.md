SMBINFO(1)                                                                                  SMBINFO(1)

NAME
       smbinfo  -  Userspace  helper to display SMB-specific file information for the Linux SMB client
       file system (CIFS)

SYNOPSIS
          smbinfo [-v] [-V] {command} {file system object}

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite.

       smbinfo is a userspace helper program for the Linux SMB client file system (CIFS).  It  is  in‐
       tended to display SMB-specific file informations such as Security Descriptors and Quota.

       This  tool  works by making an CIFS_QUERY_INFO IOCTL call to the Linux SMB client which in turn
       issues a SMB Query Info request and returns the result. This differs from getcifsacl which uses
       extended file attributes.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print version number and exit.

       -V     Verbose output.

COMMAND
       fileaccessinfo: Prints the FileAccessInformation class

       filealigninfo: Prints the FileAlignmentInformation class

       fileallinfo: Prints the FileAllInformation class

       filebasicinfo: Prints the FileBasicInformation class

       fileeainfo: Prints the FileEaInformation class

       filefsfullsizeinfo: Prints the FileFsFullSizeInformation class

       fileinternalinfo: Prints the FileInternalInformation class

       filemodeinfo: Prints the FileModeInformation class

       filepositioninfo: Prints the FilePositionInformation class

       filestandardinfo: Prints the FileStandardInformation class

       fsctl-getobjid: Prints the ObjectID

       list-snapshots: Lists the previous versions of the volume that backs this file

       quota:  Print  the  quota  for the volume in the form - SID Length - Change Time - Quota Used -
       Quota Threshold - Quota Limit - SID

       secdesc: Print the security descriptor in the form - Revision - Control - Owner SID - Group SID
       - ACL - File types - File flags

NOTES
       Kernel support for smbinfo utilities requires the CIFS_QUERY_INFO IOCTL which was initially in‐
       troduced in the 4.20 kernel and is only implemented for mount points using SMB2 or  above  (see
       mount.cifs(8) vers option).
