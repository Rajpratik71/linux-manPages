NAME
       kpsewhere - Expanding kpsewhich to separately iterate over each texmf tree listed in $TEXMF.

SYNOPSIS
       kpsewhere  [ kpsewhich-OPTIONS... ] COMMAND

DESCRIPTION
       kpsewhere  is an extension to kpsewhich (as where is for which in tcsh).  The intention is to provide a way to check for conflicts/shadowed files. It will, however, only find one
       file per TEXMF tree.

OPTIONS
       -h|--help
              show a short help message

       *      all other options are directly handed to kpsewhich
