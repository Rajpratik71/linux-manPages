NAME
       hackrf_max2837 - chip register read/write tool

DESCRIPTION
       The  HackRF  project  started  by  Michael Ossmann and Jared Boone to build software radio peripheral using Free Software and Free Hardware
       design. Care was taken to only use electronic components with published documentation (no NDAs!) and to avoid  software  libraries  without
       open source licenses.

       Jawbreaker is the first complete HackRF platform, a wideband software radio transceiver with a USB interface.

       This application lets the user control the max2837 chip.

SYNOPSIS

       -r, --read: read register specified by last -n argument, or all registers
