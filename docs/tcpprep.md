TCPPREP(1)                                                      Programmer's Manual                                                     TCPPREP(1)

NAME
       tcpprep - Create a tcpreplay cache cache file from a pcap file.

SYNOPSIS
       tcpprep [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...

       All arguments must be options.

       tcpprep  is  a  pcap(3)  file  pre-processor which creates a cache file which provides "rules" for tcprewrite(1) and tcpreplay(1) on how to
       process and send packets.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the tcpprep command.  The basic operation of tcpreplay is to resend all packets from the  input  file(s)
       out  a  single  file.  Tcpprep processes a pcap file and applies a set of user-specified rules to create a cache file which tells tcpreplay
       wether or not to send each packet and which interface the packet should be sent out of.

       For more details, please see the Tcpreplay Manual at: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manual

OPTIONS
       -d number, --dbug=number
              Enable debugging output.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value  of
              number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 5
              The default number for this option is:
                   0

              If configured with --enable-debug, then you can specify a verbosity level for debugging output.  Higher numbers increase verbosity.

       -a string, --auto=string
              Auto-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: cidr, port, regex, mac.

              Tcpprep will try to automatically determine the primary function of hosts based on the traffic captured and classify each host as
              client or server.  In order to do so, you must provide a hint to tcpprep as to how to search for clients and servers.  Valid hints
              are:

              bridge Bridge mode processes each packet to try to determine if the sender is a client or server.  Once all the packets are pro‐
              cessed, the results are weighed according to the server/client ratio (--ratio) and systems are assigned an interface.  If tcpprep is
              unable to determine what role a system plays, tcpprep will abort.

              router Router mode works just like bridge mode, except that after weighing is done, systems which are undetermined are considered a
              server if they fall inside a network known to contain other servers.  Router has a greater chance of successfully splitting clients
              and servers but is not 100% foolproof.

              client Client mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are treated as clients.  Client mode should always
              complete successfully.

              server Server mode works just like bridge mode, except that unclassified systems are treated as servers.  Server mode should always
              complete successfully.

              first First mode works by looking at the first time each IP is seen in the SRC and DST fields in the IP header.  If the host is
              first seen in the SRC field, it is a client and if it's first seen in the DST field, it is marked as a server.   This effectively
              replicates the processing of the tomahawk test tool.  First mode should always complete successfully.

       -c string, --cidr=string
              CIDR-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: auto, port, regex, mac.

              Specify a comma delimited list of CIDR netblocks to match against the source IP of each packet.  Packets matching any of the CIDR's
              are classified as servers.

              IPv4 Example:
                  --cidr=192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8
              IPv6 Example:
                  --cidr=[::ffff:0:0/96],[fe80::/16]

       -r string, --regex=string
              Regex-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: auto, port, cidr, mac.

              Specify a regular expression to match against the source IP of each packet.  Packets matching the regex are classified as servers.

       -p, --port
              Port-split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: auto, regex, cidr, mac.

              Specifies that TCP and UDP traffic over IPv4 and IPv6 should be classified as client or server based upon the destination port of
              the header.

       -e string, --mac=string
              Source MAC split mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of the following
              options: auto, regex, cidr, port.

              Specify a list of MAC addresses to match against the source MAC of each packet.  Packets matching one of the values are classified
              as servers.

       --reverse
              Matches to be client instead of server.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

              Normally the --mac, --regex and --cidr flags specify are used to specify the servers and non-IP packets are classified as clients.
              By using --reverse, these features are reversed so that the flags specify clients and non-IP packets are classified as servers.

       -C string, --comment=string
              Embeded cache file comment.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

              Specify a comment to be imbedded within the output cache file and later viewed.

       --no-arg-comment
              Do not embed any cache file comment.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

              By default, tcpprep includes the arguments passed on the command line in the cache file comment (in addition to any user specified
              --comment).  If for some reason you do not wish to include this, specify this option.

       -x string, --include=string
              Include only packets matching rule.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any of
              the following options: exclude.

              Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send/edit packets which match the provided rule.
              Rules can be one of:

              S:<CIDR1>,...  - Source IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              D:<CIDR1>,...  - Destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              B:<CIDR1>,...  - Both source and destination IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              E:<CIDR1>,...  - Either IP must match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              P:<LIST> - Must be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the packet number in the capture file.
                  -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
              would process packets 1 thru 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

              F:'<bpf>' - BPF filter.  See the tcpdump(8) man page for syntax.

       -X string, --exclude=string
              Exclude any packet matching this rule.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must not appear in combination with any
              of the following options: include.

              Override default of processing all packets stored in the capture file and only send/edit packets which do NOT match the provided
              rule.  Rules can be one of:

              S:<CIDR1>,...  - Source IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              D:<CIDR1>,...  - Destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              B:<CIDR1>,...  - Both source and destination IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              E:<CIDR1>,...  - Either IP must not match specified IPv4/v6 CIDR(s)

              P:<LIST> - Must not be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the packet number in the capture file.
                  -x P:1-5,9,15,72-
              would skip packets 1 thru 5, the 9th and 15th packet, and packets 72 until the end of the file

       -o string, --cachefile=string
              Output cache file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -i string, --pcap=string
              Input pcap file to process.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -P string, --print-comment=string
              Print embedded comment in the specified cache file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -I string, --print-info=string
              Print basic info from the specified cache file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -S string, --print-stats=string
              Print statistical information about the specified cache file.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -s string, --services=string
              Load services file for server ports.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the follow‐
              ing options: port.

              Uses a list of ports used by servers in the same format as of /etc/services: <service_name>        <port>/<protocol> # comment

              Example: http            80/tcp

       -N, --nonip
              Send non-IP traffic out server interface.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

              By default, non-IP traffic which can not be classified as client or server is classified as "client".  Specifiying --nonip will
              reclassify non-IP traffic as "server".  Note that the meaning of this flag is reversed if --reverse is used.

       -R string, --ratio=string
              Ratio of client to server packets.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the following
              options: auto.  The default string for this option is:
                   2.0

              Since a given host may have both client and server traffic being sent to/from it, tcpprep uses a ratio to weigh these packets.  If
              you would like to override the default of 2:1 server to client packets required for a host to be classified as a server, specify it
              as a floating point value.

       -m number, --minmask=number
              Minimum network mask length in auto mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the
              following options: auto.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 32
              The default number for this option is:
                   30

              By default, auto modes use a minimum network mask length of 30 bits to build networks containing clients and servers.  This allows
              you to override this value.  Larger values will increase performance but may provide inaccurate results.

       -M number, --maxmask=number
              Maximum network mask length in auto mode.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the
              following options: auto.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.  The value of number is constrained to being:
                  in the range  0 through 32
              The default number for this option is:
                   8

              By default, auto modes use a maximum network mask length of 8 bits to build networks containing clients and servers.  This allows
              you to override this value.  Larger values will decrease performance and accuracy but will provide greater chance of success.

       -v, --verbose
              Print decoded packets via tcpdump to STDOUT.  This option may appear up to 1 times.

       -A string, --decode=string
              Arguments passed to tcpdump decoder.  This option may appear up to 1 times.  This option must appear in combination with the follow‐
              ing options: verbose.

              When enabling verbose mode (-v) you may also specify one or more additional arguments to pass to tcpdump to modify the way packets
              are decoded.  By default, -n and -l are used.  Be sure to quote the arguments so that they are not interpreted by tcprewrite.  The
              following arguments are valid:
                  [ -aAeNqRStuvxX ]
                  [ -E spi@ipaddr algo:secret,... ]
                  [ -s snaplen ]

       -V, --version
              Print version information.

       -h, --less-help
              Display less usage information and exit.

              This option has not been fully documented.

       -H, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       - [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
              Save the option state to rcfile.  The default is the last configuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       - rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
              Load options from rcfile.  The no-load-opts form will disable the loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is handled early,
              out of order.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).  The homerc
       file is "$$/", unless that is a directory.  In that case, the file ".tcppreprc" is searched for within that directory.
