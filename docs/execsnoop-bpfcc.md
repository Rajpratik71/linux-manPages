execsnoop(8)                                                  System Manager's Manual                                                 execsnoop(8)

NAME
       execsnoop - Trace new processes via exec() syscalls. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

SYNOPSIS
       execsnoop [-h] [-T] [-t] [-x] [-q] [-n NAME] [-l LINE] [--max-args MAX_ARGS]

DESCRIPTION
       execsnoop traces new processes, showing the filename executed and argument list.

       It  works  by  traces  the  execve() system call (commonly used exec() variant).  This catches new processes that follow the fork->exec se‚Äê
       quence, as well as processes that re-exec() themselves. Some applications fork() but do not exec(), eg, for worker processes,  which  won't
       be included in the execsnoop output.

       This works by tracing the kernel sys_execve() function using dynamic tracing, and will need updating to match any changes to this function.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

REQUIREMENTS
       CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

OPTIONS
       -h     Print usage message.

       -T     Include a time column (HH:MM:SS).

       -t     Include a timestamp column.

       -x     Include failed exec()s

       -q     Add  "quotemarks"  around  arguments. Escape quotemarks in arguments with a backslash. For tracing empty arguments or arguments that
              contain whitespace.

       -n NAME
              Only print command lines matching this name (regex)

       -l LINE
              Only print commands where arg contains this line (regex)

       --max-args MAXARGS
              Maximum number of arguments parsed and displayed, defaults to 20

EXAMPLES
       Trace all exec() syscalls:
              # execsnoop

       Trace all exec() syscalls, and include timestamps:
              # execsnoop -t

       Include failed exec()s:
              # execsnoop -x

       Put quotemarks around arguments.
              # execsnoop -q

       Only trace exec()s where the filename contains "mount":
              # execsnoop -n mount

       Only trace exec()s where argument's line contains "testpkg":
              # execsnoop -l testpkg

FIELDS
       TIME   Time of exec() return, in HH:MM:SS format.

       TIME(s)
              Time of exec() return, in seconds.

       PCOMM  Parent process/command name.

       PID    Process ID

       PPID   Parent process ID

       RET    Return value of exec(). 0 == successs. Failures are only shown when using the -x option.

       ARGS   Filename for the exec(), followed be up to 19 arguments. An ellipsis "..." is shown if the argument list is known to be truncated.

OVERHEAD
       This traces the kernel execve function and prints output for each event. As the rate of this is generally expected to be  low  (<  1000/s),
       the overhead is also expected to be negligible. If you have an application that is calling a high rate of exec()s, then test and understand
       overhead before use.
