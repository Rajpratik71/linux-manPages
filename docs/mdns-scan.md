NAME
       mdns-scan - Scan for mDNS/DNS-SD services published on the local network

SYNOPSIS
       mdns-scan

DESCRIPTION
       mdns-scan  is  a  tool  for  scanning for mDNS/DNS-SD published services on the local network. It issues a mDNS PTR query to the special RR
       _services._dns-sd._udp.local for retrieving a list of all currently registered services on the local link.

OPTIONS
       mdns-scan has no commandline options.

NOTES
       mdns-scan is not a good mDNS citizen since it queries continuously for services and doesn't implement features like Duplicate  Suppression.
       It is intended for usage as a debugging tool only.

       mdns-scan  is incomplete since it doesn't resolve mDNS services for you - it just dumps their PTR RRs. To understand these records you need
       minimal knowledge of DNS-SD and how it works.

       mdns-scan does not terminate on its own behalf. It scans for services continuously until the user kills it by pressing C-c.

       mdns-scan does not rely on a local mDNS responder daemon. It has no dependencies besides the GNU libc. It has been tested on Linux only.

       mdns-scan does NOT scan for local mDNS enabled hosts or A/AAAA RRs, it scans for DNS-SD registered services, nothing else.
