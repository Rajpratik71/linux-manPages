NAME
       ttf2afm - utility to generate AFM files for TrueType fonts

SYNOPSIS
       ttf2afm [OPTIONS] FONTFILE

DESCRIPTION
       ttf2afm is used to generate Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files for TrueType (TTF) fonts to allow them to be used with TeX.

       ttf2afm takes the name of a TrueType font file as a required argument.  It may also take one or more options from the list below (-i and -u are mutually exclusive).

OPTIONS
       -i     force printing glyph names in form `index'decnum

       -u     force printing glyph names in form `uni'hexnum

       -c name
              write encoding tables to file name.eMN, where M is the platform ID and N is the encoding ID

       -v     print program version

       -e enc encode AFM output using encoding vector from enc

       -o outfile
              output to file outfile instead of standard output

       -m num use Unicode mapping num in the font

       Platform numbers can be one of

       0      Apple Unicode

       1      Macintosh

       2      ISO

       3      Microsoft
