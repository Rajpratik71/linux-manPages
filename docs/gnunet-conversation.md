NAME
       gnunet-conversation - have a conversation with your peers

SYNOPSIS
       gnunet-conversation -e NAME [OPTIONS] URI

DESCRIPTION
       gnunet-conversation  can be used to have a conversation with other GNUnet users.  You can make
       calls and receive incoming calls.  You need to setup an ego using gnunet-identity first.   For
       others to be able to call you, you must add a PHONE record to your zone in the GNU Name System
       (using gnunet-namestore).  gnunet-conversation has an interactive help system  via  the  /help
       command.
