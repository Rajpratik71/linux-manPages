MYSQL(1)                               MariaDB Database System                               MYSQL(1)

NAME
       mysql - the MariaDB command-line tool

SYNOPSIS
       mysql [options] db_name

DESCRIPTION
       mysql is a simple SQL shell (with GNU readline capabilities). It supports interactive and
       non-interactive use. When used interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII-table
       format. When used non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is presented in
       tab-separated format. The output format can be changed using command options.

       If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result sets, use the --quick option.
       This forces mysql to retrieve results from the server a row at a time rather than retrieving
       the entire result set and buffering it in memory before displaying it. This is done by
       returning the result set using the mysql_use_result() C API function in the client/server
       library rather than mysql_store_result().

       Using mysql is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your command interpreter as follows:

           shell> mysql db_name

       Or:

           shell> mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password db_name

       Then type an SQL statement, end it with “;”, \g, or \G and press Enter.

       Typing Control-C causes mysql to attempt to kill the current statement. If this cannot be
       done, or Control-C is typed again before the statement is killed, mysql exits.

       You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) like this:

           shell> mysql db_name < script.sql > output.tab

MYSQL OPTIONS
       mysql supports the following options, which can be specified on the command line or in the
       [mysql], [client], [client-server] or [client-mariadb] option file groups.  mysql also
       supports the options for processing option files.

       ·   --help, -?, -I

           Display a help message and exit.

       ·   --abort-source-on-error

           Abort 'source filename' operations in case of errors.

       ·   --auto-rehash

           Enable automatic rehashing. This option is on by default, which enables database, table,
           and column name completion. Use --disable-auto-rehash, --no-auto-rehash,  or
           --skip-auto-rehash to disable rehashing. That causes mysql to start faster, but you must
           issue the rehash command if you want to use name completion.

           To complete a name, enter the first part and press Tab. If the name is unambiguous, mysql
           completes it. Otherwise, you can press Tab again to see the possible names that begin with
           what you have typed so far. Completion does not occur if there is no default database.

       ·   --auto-vertical-output

           Automatically switch to vertical output mode if the result is wider than the terminal
           width.

       ·   --batch, -B

           Print results using tab as the column separator, with each row on a new line. With this
           option, mysql does not use the history file.

           Batch mode results in nontabular output format and escaping of special characters.
           Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see the description for the --raw option.

       ·   --binary-mode

           By default, ASCII '\0' is disallowed and '\r\n' is translated to '\n'. This switch turns
           off both features, and also turns off parsing of all client commands except \C and
           DELIMITER, in non-interactive mode (for input piped to mysql or loaded using the 'source'
           command). This is necessary when processing output from mysqlbinlog that may contain
           blobs.

       ·   --character-sets-dir=path

           The directory where character sets are installed.

       ·   --column-names

           Write column names in results.

       ·   --column-type-info, -m

           Display result set metadata.

       ·   --comments, -c

           Whether to preserve comments in statements sent to the server. The default is
           --skip-comments (discard comments), enable with --comments (preserve comments).

       ·   --compress, -C

           Compress all information sent between the client and the server if both support
           compression.

       ·   --connect-timeout=seconds

           Set the number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value is 0.)

       ·   --database=db_name, -D db_name

           The database to use.

       ·   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]

           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is ´d:t:o,file_name´. The default is
           ´d:t:o,/tmp/mysql.trace´.

       ·   --debug-check

           Print some debugging information when the program exits.

       ·   --debug-info, -T

           Prints debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics when the program exits.

       ·   --default-auth=name

           Default authentication client-side plugin to use.

       ·   --default-character-set=charset_name

           Use charset_name as the default character set for the client and connection.

           A common issue that can occur when the operating system uses utf8 or another multi-byte
           character set is that output from the mysql client is formatted incorrectly, due to the
           fact that the MariaDB client uses the latin1 character set by default. You can usually fix
           such issues by using this option to force the client to use the system character set
           instead.

       ·   --defaults-extra-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from after the global defaults files has
           been read.  Must be given as first option.

       ·   --defaults-file=filename

           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override global defaults files.
           Must be given as first option.

       ·   --defaults-group-suffix=suffix

           In addition to the groups named on the command line, read groups that have the given
           suffix.

       ·   --delimiter=str

           Set the statement delimiter. The default is the semicolon character (“;”).

       ·   --disable-named-commands

           Disable named commands. Use the \* form only, or use named commands only at the beginning
           of a line ending with a semicolon (“;”).  mysql starts with this option enabled by
           default. However, even with this option, long-format commands still work from the first
           line. See the section called “MYSQL COMMANDS”.

       ·   --execute=statement, -e statement

           Execute the statement and quit. Disables --force and history file. The default output
           format is like that produced with --batch.

       ·   --force, -f

           Continue even if an SQL error occurs. Sets --abort-source-on-error to 0.

       ·   --host=host_name, -h host_name

           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.

       ·   --html, -H

           Produce HTML output.

       ·   --ignore-spaces, -i

           Ignore spaces after function names. Allows one to have spaces (including tab characters
           and new line characters) between function name and '('. The drawback is that this causes
           built in functions to become reserved words.

       ·   --init-command=str

           SQL Command to execute when connecting to the MariaDB server. Will automatically be re-
           executed when reconnecting.

       ·   --line-numbers

           Write line numbers for errors. Disable this with --skip-line-numbers.

       ·   --local-infile[={0|1}]

           Enable or disable LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA INFILE. With no value, the option enables
           LOCAL. The option may be given as --local-infile=0 or --local-infile=1 to explicitly
           disable or enable LOCAL. Enabling LOCAL has no effect if the server does not also support
           it.

       ·   --max-allowed-packet=num

           Set the maximum packet length to send to or receive from the server. (Default value is
           16MB, largest 1GB.)

       ·   --max-join-size=num

           Set the automatic limit for rows in a join when using --safe-updates. (Default value is
           1,000,000.)

       ·   --named-commands, -G

           Enable named mysql commands. Long-format commands are allowed, not just short-format
           commands. For example, quit and \q both are recognized. Use --skip-named-commands to
           disable named commands. See the section called “MYSQL COMMANDS”. Disabled by default.

       ·   --net-buffer-length=size

           Set the buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default value is 16KB.)

       ·   --no-auto-rehash, -A

           This has the same effect as --skip-auto-rehash. See the description for --auto-rehash.

       ·   --no-beep, -b

           Do not beep when errors occur.

       ·   --no-defaults

           Do not read default options from any option file. This must be given as the first
           argument.

       ·   --one-database, -o

           Ignore statements except those those that occur while the default database is the one
           named on the command line. This filtering is limited, and based only on USE statements.
           This is useful for skipping updates to other databases in the binary log.

       ·   --pager[=command]

           Use the given command for paging query output. If the command is omitted, the default
           pager is the value of your PAGER environment variable. Valid pagers are less, more, cat [>
           filename], and so forth. This option works only on Unix and only in interactive mode. To
           disable paging, use --skip-pager.  the section called “MYSQL COMMANDS”, discusses output
           paging further.

       ·   --password[=password], -p[password]

           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (-p),
           you cannot have a space between the option and the password. If you omit the password
           value following the --password or -p option on the command line, mysql prompts for one.

           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. You can use an
           option file to avoid giving the password on the command line.

       ·   --pipe, -W

           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option applies only if the server
           supports named-pipe connections.

       ·   --plugin-dir=dir_name

           Directory for client-side plugins.

       ·   --port=port_num, -P port_num

           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection or 0 for default to, in order of
           preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT, /etc/services, built-in default (3306).

       ·   --print-defaults

           Print the program argument list and exit. This must be given as the first argument.

       ·   --progress-reports

           Get progress reports for long running commands (such as ALTER TABLE). (Defaults to on; use
           --skip-progress-reports to disable.)

       ·   --prompt=format_str

           Set the prompt to the specified format. The special sequences that the prompt can contain
           are described in the section called “MYSQL COMMANDS”.

       ·   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}

           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It is useful when the other
           connection parameters normally would cause a protocol to be used other than the one you
           want.

       ·   --quick, -q

           Do not cache each query result, print each row as it is received. This may slow down the
           server if the output is suspended. With this option, mysql does not use the history file.

       ·   --raw, -r

           For tabular output, the “boxing” around columns enables one column value to be
           distinguished from another. For nontabular output (such as is produced in batch mode or
           when the --batch or --silent option is given), special characters are escaped in the
           output so they can be identified easily. Newline, tab, NUL, and backslash are written as
           \n, \t, \0, and \\. The --raw option disables this character escaping.

           The following example demonstrates tabular versus nontabular output and the use of raw
           mode to disable escaping:

               % mysql
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               +----------+
               | CHAR(92) |
               +----------+
               | \        |
               +----------+
               % mysql -s
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \\
               % mysql -s -r
               mysql> SELECT CHAR(92);
               CHAR(92)
               \

       ·   --reconnect

           If the connection to the server is lost, automatically try to reconnect. A single
           reconnect attempt is made each time the connection is lost. Enabled by default, to disable
           use --skip-reconnect or --disable-reconnect.

       ·   --safe-updates, --i-am-a-dummy, -U

           Allow only those UPDATE and DELETE statements that specify which rows to modify by using
           key values. If you have set this option in an option file, you can override it by using
           --safe-updates on the command line. See the section called “MYSQL TIPS”, for more
           information about this option.

       ·   --secure-auth

           Do not send passwords to the server in old (pre-4.1.1) format. This prevents connections
           except for servers that use the newer password format.

       ·   --select-limit=limit

           Set automatic limit for SELECT when using --safe-updates. (Default value is 1,000.)

       ·   --server-arg=name

           Send name as a parameter to the embedded server.

       ·   --show-warnings

           Cause warnings to be shown after each statement if there are any. This option applies to
           interactive and batch mode.

       ·   --sigint-ignore

           Ignore SIGINT signals (typically the result of typing Control-C).

       ·   --silent, -s

           Silent mode. Produce less output. This option can be given multiple times to produce less
           and less output.

           This option results in nontabular output format and escaping of special characters.
           Escaping may be disabled by using raw mode; see the description for the --raw option.

       ·   --skip-auto-rehash

           Disable automatic rehashing. Synonym for --disable-auto-rehash.

       ·   --skip-column-names, -N

           Do not write column names in results.

       ·   --skip-line-numbers, -L

           Do not write line numbers for errors. Useful when you want to compare result files that
           include error messages.

       ·   --socket=path, -S path

           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on Windows, the name of the
           named pipe to use.

       ·   --ssl

           Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with other flags). Disable with --skip-
           ssl.

       ·   --ssl-ca=name

           CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-capath=name

           CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-cert=name

           X509 cert in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-cipher=name

           SSL cipher to use (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-key=name

           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-crl=name

           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-crlpath=name

           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).

       ·   --ssl-verify-server-cert

           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname used when connecting. This
           option is disabled by default.

       ·   --table, -t

           Display output in table format. This is the default for interactive use, but can be used
           to produce table output in batch mode.

       ·   --tee=file_name

           Append a copy of output to the given file. This option works only in interactive mode.
           the section called “MYSQL COMMANDS”, discusses tee files further.

       ·   --unbuffered, -n

           Flush the buffer after each query.

       ·   --user=user_name, -u user_name

           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.

       ·   --verbose, -v

           Verbose mode. Produce more output about what the program does. This option can be given
           multiple times to produce more and more output. (For example, -v -v -v produces table
           output format even in batch mode.)

       ·   --version, -V

           Display version information and exit.

       ·   --vertical, -E

           Print query output rows vertically (one line per column value). Without this option, you
           can specify vertical output for individual statements by terminating them with \G.

       ·   --wait, -w

           If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead of aborting.

       ·   --xml, -X

           Produce XML output.  The output when --xml is used with mysql matches that of mysqldump
           --xml. See mysqldump(1) for details.

           The XML output also uses an XML namespace, as shown here:

               shell> mysql --xml -uroot -e "SHOW VARIABLES LIKE ´version%´"
               <?xml version="1.0"?>
               <resultset statement="SHOW VARIABLES LIKE ´version%´" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version</field>
               <field name="Value">5.0.40-debug</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_comment</field>
               <field name="Value">Source distribution</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_machine</field>
               <field name="Value">i686</field>
               </row>
               <row>
               <field name="Variable_name">version_compile_os</field>
               <field name="Value">suse-linux-gnu</field>
               </row>
               </resultset>

           You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value.

           ·   connect_timeout

               The number of seconds before connection timeout. (Default value is 0.)

           ·   max_allowed_packet

               The maximum packet length to send to or receive from the server. (Default value is
               16MB.)

           ·   max_join_size

               The automatic limit for rows in a join when using --safe-updates. (Default value is
               1,000,000.)

           ·   net_buffer_length

               The buffer size for TCP/IP and socket communication. (Default value is 16KB.)

           ·   select_limit

               The automatic limit for SELECT statements when using --safe-updates. (Default value is
               1,000.)

           On Unix, the mysql client writes a record of executed statements to a history file. By
           default, this file is named .mysql_history and is created in your home directory. To
           specify a different file, set the value of the MYSQL_HISTFILE environment variable.

           The .mysql_history should be protected with a restrictive access mode because sensitive
           information might be written to it, such as the text of SQL statements that contain
           passwords.

           If you do not want to maintain a history file, first remove .mysql_history if it exists,
           and then use either of the following techniques:

           ·   Set the MYSQL_HISTFILE variable to /dev/null. To cause this setting to take effect
               each time you log in, put the setting in one of your shell´s startup files.

           ·   Create .mysql_history as a symbolic link to /dev/null:

                   shell> ln -s /dev/null $HOME/.mysql_history

               You need do this only once.

MYSQL COMMANDS
       mysql sends each SQL statement that you issue to the server to be executed. There is also a
       set of commands that mysql itself interprets. For a list of these commands, type help or \h at
       the mysql> prompt:

           mysql> help
           List of all MySQL commands:
           Note that all text commands must be first on line and end with ´;´
           ?         (\?) Synonym for `help´.
           clear     (\c) Clear command.

       Each command has both a long and short form. The long form is not case sensitive; the short
       form is. The long form can be followed by an optional semicolon terminator, but the short form
       should not.

       The use of short-form commands within multi-line /* ... */ comments is not supported.

       ·   help [arg], \h [arg], \? [arg], ? [arg]

           Display a help message listing the available mysql commands.

           If you provide an argument to the help command, mysql uses it as a search string to access
           server-side help. For more information, see the section called “MYSQL SERVER-SIDE HELP”.

       ·   charset charset_name, \C charset_name

           Change the default character set and issue a SET NAMES statement. This enables the
           character set to remain synchronized on the client and server if mysql is run with
           auto-reconnect enabled (which is not recommended), because the specified character set is
           used for reconnects.

       ·   clear, \c

           Clear the current input. Use this if you change your mind about executing the statement
           that you are entering.

       ·   connect [db_name host_name]], \r [db_name host_name]]

           Reconnect to the server. The optional database name and host name arguments may be given
           to specify the default database or the host where the server is running. If omitted, the
           current values are used.

       ·   delimiter str, \d str

           Change the string that mysql interprets as the separator between SQL statements. The
           default is the semicolon character (“;”).

           The delimiter can be specified as an unquoted or quoted argument. Quoting can be done with
           either single quote (´) or douple quote (") characters. To include a quote within a quoted
           string, either quote the string with the other quote character or escape the quote with a
           backslash (“\”) character. Backslash should be avoided outside of quoted strings because
           it is the escape character for MariaDB. For an unquoted argument, the delmiter is read up
           to the first space or end of line. For a quoted argument, the delimiter is read up to the
           matching quote on the line.

           When the delimiter recognized by mysql is set to something other than the default of “;”,
           instances of that character are sent to the server without interpretation. However, the
           server itself still interprets “;” as a statement delimiter and processes statements
           accordingly. This behavior on the server side comes into play for multiple-statement
           execution, and for parsing the body of stored procedures and functions, triggers, and
           events.

       ·   edit, \e

           Edit the current input statement.  mysql checks the values of the EDITOR and VISUAL
           environment variables to determine which editor to use. The default editor is vi if
           neither variable is set.

           The edit command works only in Unix.

       ·   ego, \G

           Send the current statement to the server to be executed and display the result using
           vertical format.

       ·   exit, \q

           Exit mysql.

       ·   go, \g

           Send the current statement to the server to be executed.

       ·   nopager, \n

           Disable output paging. See the description for pager.

           The nopager command works only in Unix.

       ·   notee, \t

           Disable output copying to the tee file. See the description for tee.

       ·   nowarning, \w

           Enable display of warnings after each statement.

       ·   pager [command], \P [command]

           Enable output paging. By using the --pager option when you invoke mysql, it is possible to
           browse or search query results in interactive mode with Unix programs such as less, more,
           or any other similar program. If you specify no value for the option, mysql checks the
           value of the PAGER environment variable and sets the pager to that. Pager functionality
           works only in interactive mode.

           Output paging can be enabled interactively with the pager command and disabled with
           nopager. The command takes an optional argument; if given, the paging program is set to
           that. With no argument, the pager is set to the pager that was set on the command line, or
           stdout if no pager was specified.

           Output paging works only in Unix because it uses the popen() function, which does not
           exist on Windows. For Windows, the tee option can be used instead to save query output,
           although it is not as convenient as pager for browsing output in some situations.

       ·   print, \p

           Print the current input statement without executing it.

       ·   prompt [str], \R [str]

           Reconfigure the mysql prompt to the given string. The special character sequences that can
           be used in the prompt are described later in this section.

           If you specify the prompt command with no argument, mysql resets the prompt to the default
           of mysql>.

       ·   quit, \q

           Exit mysql.

       ·   rehash, \#

           Rebuild the completion hash that enables database, table, and column name completion while
           you are entering statements. (See the description for the --auto-rehash option.)

       ·   source file_name, \. file_name

           Read the named file and executes the statements contained therein. On Windows, you can
           specify path name separators as / or \\.

       ·   status, \s

           Provide status information about the connection and the server you are using. If you are
           running in --safe-updates mode, status also prints the values for the mysql variables that
           affect your queries.

       ·   system command, \! command

           Execute the given command using your default command interpreter.

           The system command works only in Unix.

       ·   tee [file_name], \T [file_name]

           By using the --tee option when you invoke mysql, you can log statements and their output.
           All the data displayed on the screen is appended into a given file. This can be very
           useful for debugging purposes also.  mysql flushes results to the file after each
           statement, just before it prints its next prompt. Tee functionality works only in
           interactive mode.

           You can enable this feature interactively with the tee command. Without a parameter, the
           previous file is used. The tee file can be disabled with the notee command. Executing tee
           again re-enables logging.

       ·   use db_name, \u db_name

           Use db_name as the default database.

       ·   warnings, \W

           Enable display of warnings after each statement (if there are any).

       Here are a few tips about the pager command:

       ·   You can use it to write to a file and the results go only to the file:

               mysql> pager cat > /tmp/log.txt

           You can also pass any options for the program that you want to use as your pager:

               mysql> pager less -n -i -S

       ·   In the preceding example, note the -S option. You may find it very useful for browsing
           wide query results. Sometimes a very wide result set is difficult to read on the screen.
           The -S option to less can make the result set much more readable because you can scroll it
           horizontally using the left-arrow and right-arrow keys. You can also use -S interactively
           within less to switch the horizontal-browse mode on and off. For more information, read
           the less manual page:

               shell> man less

       ·   The -F and -X options may be used with less to cause it to exit if output fits on one
           screen, which is convenient when no scrolling is necessary:

               mysql> pager less -n -i -S -F -X

       ·   You can specify very complex pager commands for handling query output:

               mysql> pager cat | tee /dr1/tmp/res.txt \
                         | tee /dr2/tmp/res2.txt | less -n -i -S

           In this example, the command would send query results to two files in two different
           directories on two different file systems mounted on /dr1 and /dr2, yet still display the
           results onscreen via less.

       You can also combine the tee and pager functions. Have a tee file enabled and pager set to
       less, and you are able to browse the results using the less program and still have everything
       appended into a file the same time. The difference between the Unix tee used with the pager
       command and the mysql built-in tee command is that the built-in tee works even if you do not
       have the Unix tee available. The built-in tee also logs everything that is printed on the
       screen, whereas the Unix tee used with pager does not log quite that much. Additionally, tee
       file logging can be turned on and off interactively from within mysql. This is useful when you
       want to log some queries to a file, but not others.

       The prompt command reconfigures the default mysql> prompt. The string for defining the prompt
       can contain the following special sequences.

       You can set the prompt in several ways:

       ·   Use an environment variable.  You can set the MYSQL_PS1 environment variable to a prompt
           string. For example:

               shell> export MYSQL_PS1="(\u@\h) [\d]> "

       ·   Use a command-line option.  You can set the --prompt option on the command line to mysql.
           For example:

               shell> mysql --prompt="(\u@\h) [\d]> "
               (user@host) [database]>

       ·   Use an option file.  You can set the prompt option in the [mysql] group of any MariaDB
           option file, such as /etc/my.cnf or the .my.cnf file in your home directory. For example:

               [mysql]
               prompt=(\\u@\\h) [\\d]>\\_

           In this example, note that the backslashes are doubled. If you set the prompt using the
           prompt option in an option file, it is advisable to double the backslashes when using the
           special prompt options. There is some overlap in the set of allowable prompt options and
           the set of special escape sequences that are recognized in option files. The overlap may
           cause you problems if you use single backslashes. For example, \s is interpreted as a
           space rather than as the current seconds value. The following example shows how to define
           a prompt within an option file to include the current time in HH:MM:SS> format:

               [mysql]
               prompt="\\r:\\m:\\s> "

       ·   Set the prompt interactively.  You can change your prompt interactively by using the
           prompt (or \R) command. For example:

               mysql> prompt (\u@\h) [\d]>\_
               PROMPT set to ´(\u@\h) [\d]>\_´
               (user@host) [database]>
               (user@host) [database]> prompt
               Returning to default PROMPT of mysql>
               mysql>

MYSQL SERVER-SIDE HELP
           mysql> help search_string

       If you provide an argument to the help command, mysql uses it as a search string to access
       server-side help. The proper operation of this command requires that the help tables in the
       mysql database be initialized with help topic information.

       If there is no match for the search string, the search fails:

           mysql> help me
           Nothing found
           Please try to run ´help contents´ for a list of all accessible topics

       Use help contents to see a list of the help categories:

           mysql> help contents
           You asked for help about help category: "Contents"
           For more information, type ´help <item>´, where <item> is one of the
           following categories:
              Account Management
              Administration
              Data Definition
              Data Manipulation
              Data Types
              Functions
              Functions and Modifiers for Use with GROUP BY
              Geographic Features

              Plugins
              Storage Engines
              Stored Routines
              Table Maintenance
              Transactions
              Triggers

       If the search string matches multiple items, mysql shows a list of matching topics:

           mysql> help logs
           Many help items for your request exist.
           To make a more specific request, please type ´help <item>´,
           where <item> is one of the following topics:
              SHOW
              SHOW BINARY LOGS
              SHOW ENGINE
              SHOW LOGS

       Use a topic as the search string to see the help entry for that topic:

           mysql> help show binary logs
           Name: ´SHOW BINARY LOGS´
           Description:
           Syntax:
           SHOW BINARY LOGS
           SHOW MASTER LOGS
           Lists the binary log files on the server. This statement is used as
           part of the procedure described in [purge-binary-logs], that shows how
           to determine which logs can be purged.
           mysql> SHOW BINARY LOGS;

EXECUTING SQL STATEMENTS FROM A TEXT FILE
       The mysql client typically is used interactively, like this:

           shell> mysql db_name

       However, it is also possible to put your SQL statements in a file and then tell mysql to read
       its input from that file. To do so, create a text file text_file that contains the statements
       you wish to execute. Then invoke mysql as shown here:

           shell> mysql db_name < text_file

       If you place a USE db_name statement as the first statement in the file, it is unnecessary to
       specify the database name on the command line:

           shell> mysql < text_file

       If you are already running mysql, you can execute an SQL script file using the source command
       or \.  command:

           mysql> source file_name
           mysql> \. file_name

       Sometimes you may want your script to display progress information to the user. For this you
       can insert statements like this:

           SELECT ´<info_to_display>´ AS ´ ´;

       The statement shown outputs <info_to_display>.

       You can also invoke mysql with the --verbose option, which causes each statement to be
       displayed before the result that it produces.

       mysql ignores Unicode byte order mark (BOM) characters at the beginning of input files.
       Presence of a BOM does not cause mysql to change its default character set. To do that, invoke
       mysql with an option such as --default-character-set=utf8.

MYSQL TIPS
       This section describes some techniques that can help you use mysql more effectively.

   Displaying Query Results Vertically
       Some query results are much more readable when displayed vertically, instead of in the usual
       horizontal table format. Queries can be displayed vertically by terminating the query with \G
       instead of a semicolon. For example, longer text values that include newlines often are much
       easier to read with vertical output:

           mysql> SELECT * FROM mails WHERE LENGTH(txt) < 300 LIMIT 300,1\G
           *************************** 1. row ***************************
             msg_nro: 3068
                date: 2000-03-01 23:29:50

           Yes, please do that.

   Using the --safe-updates Option
       For beginners, a useful startup option is --safe-updates (or --i-am-a-dummy, which has the
       same effect). It is helpful for cases when you might have issued a DELETE FROM tbl_name
       statement but forgotten the WHERE clause. Normally, such a statement deletes all rows from the
       table. With --safe-updates, you can delete rows only by specifying the key values that
       identify them. This helps prevent accidents.

       When you use the --safe-updates option, mysql issues the following statement when it connects
       to the MariaDB server:

           SET sql_safe_updates=1, sql_select_limit=1000, sql_max_join_size=1000000;

       The SET statement has the following effects:

       ·   You are not allowed to execute an UPDATE or DELETE statement unless you specify a key
           constraint in the WHERE clause or provide a LIMIT clause (or both). For example:

               UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val WHERE key_column=val;
               UPDATE tbl_name SET not_key_column=val LIMIT 1;

       ·   The server limits all large SELECT results to 1,000 rows unless the statement includes a
           LIMIT clause.

       ·   The server aborts multiple-table SELECT statements that probably need to examine more than
           1,000,000 row combinations.

       To specify limits different from 1,000 and 1,000,000, you can override the defaults by using
       the --select-limit and --max-join-size options:

           shell> mysql --safe-updates --select-limit=500 --max-join-size=10000

   Disabling mysql Auto-Reconnect
       If the mysql client loses its connection to the server while sending a statement, it
       immediately and automatically tries to reconnect once to the server and send the statement
       again. However, even if mysql succeeds in reconnecting, your first connection has ended and
       all your previous session objects and settings are lost: temporary tables, the autocommit
       mode, and user-defined and session variables. Also, any current transaction rolls back. This
       behavior may be dangerous for you, as in the following example where the server was shut down
       and restarted between the first and second statements without you knowing it:

           mysql> SET @a=1;
           Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
           mysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(@a);
           ERROR 2006: MySQL server has gone away
           No connection. Trying to reconnect...
           Connection id:    1
           Current database: test
           Query OK, 1 row affected (1.30 sec)
           mysql> SELECT * FROM t;
           +------+
           | a    |
           +------+
           | NULL |
           +------+
           1 row in set (0.05 sec)

       The @a user variable has been lost with the connection, and after the reconnection it is
       undefined. If it is important to have mysql terminate with an error if the connection has been
       lost, you can start the mysql client with the --skip-reconnect option.
