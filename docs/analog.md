DESCRIPTION
       Analog is a program for analyzing log files, and is designed to be fast and to produce attractive statistics.

       The usual (and easier) way of configuring analog is through a configuration file, not command line options.   For  more  information  about
       writing  a configuration file or about the command line options see Readme.html in the analog documentation.  A description of what options
       are available for the non-time reports is available in othreps.html#othclarg in the analog documentation.
