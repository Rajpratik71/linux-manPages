NAME
       svgpp - font converter for SVG

ttf2svg
       <ttf-path> [-l <range-begin>] [-h <range-end>] [-autorange] [-ascii] [-id <id>] [-o <output-path>] [-testcard]

DESCRIPTION
       Converts a true type font into a SVG font.  <ttf-path> is the path of the font file to convert.

OPTIONS
       -l range-begin -h range-end
              specifies the range of characters (by codepoint, in decimal) to be converted,

       -ascii forces usage of the ASCII character map in the font, instead of the Unicode character map,

       -id id specifies the value for the id attribute of the generated font element,

       -o output-path
              specifies the pathname of the output SVG document containing the generated SVG font

       -testcard
              specifies  that  a  sequence  of SVG text elements should be appended to the output SVG file to test the characters in the SVG font,
              providing an easy way to validate that generated SVG font visually.
