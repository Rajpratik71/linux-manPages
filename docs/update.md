NAME
       UPDATE - update rows of a table

SYNOPSIS
       [ WITH [ RECURSIVE ] with_query [, ...] ]
       UPDATE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [ [ AS ] alias ]
           SET { column_name = { expression | DEFAULT } |
                 ( column_name [, ...] ) = [ ROW ] ( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) |
                 ( column_name [, ...] ) = ( sub-SELECT )
               } [, ...]
           [ FROM from_list ]
           [ WHERE condition | WHERE CURRENT OF cursor_name ]
           [ RETURNING * | output_expression [ [ AS ] output_name ] [, ...] ]

DESCRIPTION
       UPDATE changes the values of the specified columns in all rows that satisfy the condition. Only the columns to be modified need be
       mentioned in the SET clause; columns not explicitly modified retain their previous values.

       There are two ways to modify a table using information contained in other tables in the database: using sub-selects, or specifying
       additional tables in the FROM clause. Which technique is more appropriate depends on the specific circumstances.

       The optional RETURNING clause causes UPDATE to compute and return value(s) based on each row actually updated. Any expression using the
       table's columns, and/or columns of other tables mentioned in FROM, can be computed. The new (post-update) values of the table's columns are
       used. The syntax of the RETURNING list is identical to that of the output list of SELECT.

       You must have the UPDATE privilege on the table, or at least on the column(s) that are listed to be updated. You must also have the SELECT
       privilege on any column whose values are read in the expressions or condition.

PARAMETERS
       with_query
           The WITH clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the UPDATE query. See Section 7.8 and
           SELECT(7) for details.

       table_name
           The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to update. If ONLY is specified before the table name, matching rows are updated in
           the named table only. If ONLY is not specified, matching rows are also updated in any tables inheriting from the named table.
           Optionally, * can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.

       alias
           A substitute name for the target table. When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table. For example, given
           UPDATE foo AS f, the remainder of the UPDATE statement must refer to this table as f not foo.

       column_name
           The name of a column in the table named by table_name. The column name can be qualified with a subfield name or array subscript, if
           needed. Do not include the table's name in the specification of a target column â€” for example, UPDATE table_name SET table_name.col = 1
           is invalid.

       expression
           An expression to assign to the column. The expression can use the old values of this and other columns in the table.

       DEFAULT
           Set the column to its default value (which will be NULL if no specific default expression has been assigned to it).

       sub-SELECT
           A SELECT sub-query that produces as many output columns as are listed in the parenthesized column list preceding it. The sub-query must
           yield no more than one row when executed. If it yields one row, its column values are assigned to the target columns; if it yields no
           rows, NULL values are assigned to the target columns. The sub-query can refer to old values of the current row of the table being
           updated.

       from_list
           A list of table expressions, allowing columns from other tables to appear in the WHERE condition and the update expressions. This is
           similar to the list of tables that can be specified in the FROM Clause of a SELECT statement. Note that the target table must not
           appear in the from_list, unless you intend a self-join (in which case it must appear with an alias in the from_list).

       condition
           An expression that returns a value of type boolean. Only rows for which this expression returns true will be updated.

       cursor_name
           The name of the cursor to use in a WHERE CURRENT OF condition. The row to be updated is the one most recently fetched from this cursor.
           The cursor must be a non-grouping query on the UPDATE's target table. Note that WHERE CURRENT OF cannot be specified together with a
           Boolean condition. See DECLARE(7) for more information about using cursors with WHERE CURRENT OF.

       output_expression
           An expression to be computed and returned by the UPDATE command after each row is updated. The expression can use any column names of
           the table named by table_name or table(s) listed in FROM. Write * to return all columns.

       output_name
           A name to use for a returned column.

OUTPUTS
       On successful completion, an UPDATE command returns a command tag of the form

           UPDATE count

       The count is the number of rows updated, including matched rows whose values did not change. Note that the number may be less than the
       number of rows that matched the condition when updates were suppressed by a BEFORE UPDATE trigger. If count is 0, no rows were updated by
       the query (this is not considered an error).

       If the UPDATE command contains a RETURNING clause, the result will be similar to that of a SELECT statement containing the columns and
       values defined in the RETURNING list, computed over the row(s) updated by the command.

NOTES
       When a FROM clause is present, what essentially happens is that the target table is joined to the tables mentioned in the from_list, and
       each output row of the join represents an update operation for the target table. When using FROM you should ensure that the join produces
       at most one output row for each row to be modified. In other words, a target row shouldn't join to more than one row from the other
       table(s). If it does, then only one of the join rows will be used to update the target row, but which one will be used is not readily
       predictable.

       Because of this indeterminacy, referencing other tables only within sub-selects is safer, though often harder to read and slower than using
       a join.

       In the case of a partitioned table, updating a row might cause it to no longer satisfy the partition constraint of the containing
       partition. In that case, if there is some other partition in the partition tree for which this row satisfies its partition constraint, then
       the row is moved to that partition. If there is no such partition, an error will occur. Behind the scenes, the row movement is actually a
       DELETE and INSERT operation.

       There is a possibility that a concurrent UPDATE or DELETE on the row being moved will get a serialization failure error. Suppose session 1
       is performing an UPDATE on a partition key, and meanwhile a concurrent session 2 for which this row is visible performs an UPDATE or DELETE
       operation on this row. In such case, session 2's UPDATE or DELETE will detect the row movement and raise a serialization failure error
       (which always returns with an SQLSTATE code '40001'). Applications may wish to retry the transaction if this occurs. In the usual case
       where the table is not partitioned, or where there is no row movement, session 2 would have identified the newly updated row and carried
       out the UPDATE/DELETE on this new row version.

       Note that while rows can be moved from local partitions to a foreign-table partition (provided the foreign data wrapper supports tuple
       routing), they cannot be moved from a foreign-table partition to another partition.

EXAMPLES
       Change the word Drama to Dramatic in the column kind of the table films:

           UPDATE films SET kind = 'Dramatic' WHERE kind = 'Drama';

       Adjust temperature entries and reset precipitation to its default value in one row of the table weather:

           UPDATE weather SET temp_lo = temp_lo+1, temp_hi = temp_lo+15, prcp = DEFAULT
             WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND date = '2003-07-03';

       Perform the same operation and return the updated entries:

           UPDATE weather SET temp_lo = temp_lo+1, temp_hi = temp_lo+15, prcp = DEFAULT
             WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND date = '2003-07-03'
             RETURNING temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp;

       Use the alternative column-list syntax to do the same update:

           UPDATE weather SET (temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp) = (temp_lo+1, temp_lo+15, DEFAULT)
             WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND date = '2003-07-03';

       Increment the sales count of the salesperson who manages the account for Acme Corporation, using the FROM clause syntax:

           UPDATE employees SET sales_count = sales_count + 1 FROM accounts
             WHERE accounts.name = 'Acme Corporation'
             AND employees.id = accounts.sales_person;

       Perform the same operation, using a sub-select in the WHERE clause:

           UPDATE employees SET sales_count = sales_count + 1 WHERE id =
             (SELECT sales_person FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Acme Corporation');

       Update contact names in an accounts table to match the currently assigned salesmen:

           UPDATE accounts SET (contact_first_name, contact_last_name) =
               (SELECT first_name, last_name FROM salesmen
                WHERE salesmen.id = accounts.sales_id);

       A similar result could be accomplished with a join:

           UPDATE accounts SET contact_first_name = first_name,
                               contact_last_name = last_name
             FROM salesmen WHERE salesmen.id = accounts.sales_id;

       However, the second query may give unexpected results if salesmen.id is not a unique key, whereas the first query is guaranteed to raise an
       error if there are multiple id matches. Also, if there is no match for a particular accounts.sales_id entry, the first query will set the
       corresponding name fields to NULL, whereas the second query will not update that row at all.

       Update statistics in a summary table to match the current data:

           UPDATE summary s SET (sum_x, sum_y, avg_x, avg_y) =
               (SELECT sum(x), sum(y), avg(x), avg(y) FROM data d
                WHERE d.group_id = s.group_id);

       Attempt to insert a new stock item along with the quantity of stock. If the item already exists, instead update the stock count of the
       existing item. To do this without failing the entire transaction, use savepoints:

           BEGIN;
           -- other operations
           SAVEPOINT sp1;
           INSERT INTO wines VALUES('Chateau Lafite 2003', '24');
           -- Assume the above fails because of a unique key violation,
           -- so now we issue these commands:
           ROLLBACK TO sp1;
           UPDATE wines SET stock = stock + 24 WHERE winename = 'Chateau Lafite 2003';
           -- continue with other operations, and eventually
           COMMIT;

       Change the kind column of the table films in the row on which the cursor c_films is currently positioned:

           UPDATE films SET kind = 'Dramatic' WHERE CURRENT OF c_films;

COMPATIBILITY
       This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the FROM and RETURNING clauses are PostgreSQL extensions, as is the ability to use
       WITH with UPDATE.

       Some other database systems offer a FROM option in which the target table is supposed to be listed again within FROM. That is not how
       PostgreSQL interprets FROM. Be careful when porting applications that use this extension.

       According to the standard, the source value for a parenthesized sub-list of target column names can be any row-valued expression yielding
       the correct number of columns.  PostgreSQL only allows the source value to be a row constructor or a sub-SELECT. An individual column's
       updated value can be specified as DEFAULT in the row-constructor case, but not inside a sub-SELECT.
