NAME
       ssldump - dump SSL traffic on a network

SYNOPSIS
       ssldump [ -vTshVq -aAdeHnNqTxXvy ] [ -i interface ]
               [ -k keyfile ] [ -p password ] [ -r dumpfile ]
               [ -S [crypto|d|ht|H|nroff] ] [ expression ]

DESCRIPTION
       ssldump  is  an  SSL/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
       them as SSL/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSL/TLS traffic, it decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If  pro‐
       vided with the appropriate keying material, it will also decrypt the connections and display the application data traffic.

       ssldump has been tested on FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and HP/UX.  Since it's based on PCAP, it should work on most platforms. However, unlike
       tcpdump, ssldump needs to be able to see both sides of the data transmission so you may have trouble using it with  network  taps  such  as
       SunOS nit that don't permit you to see transmitted data.  Under SunOS with nit or bpf: To run tcpdump you must have read access to /dev/nit
       or /dev/bpf*.  Under Solaris with dlpi: You must have read access to the network pseudo device, e.g.  /dev/le.  Under HP-UX with dlpi:  You
       must  be  root  or  it  must  be installed setuid to root.  Under IRIX with snoop: You must be root or it must be installed setuid to root.
       Under Linux: You must be root or it must be installed setuid to root.  Under Ultrix and Digital UNIX: Once the super-user has enabled  pro‐
       miscuous-mode operation using pfconfig(8), any user may run ssldump Under BSD: You must have read access to /dev/bpf*.

OPTIONS
       -a     Print bare TCP ACKs (useful for observing Nagle behavior)

       -A     Print all record fields (by default ssldump chooses the most interesting fields)

       -d     Display  the  application  data  traffic. This usually means decrypting it, but when -d is used ssldump will also decode application
              data traffic before the SSL session initiates.  This allows you to see HTTPS CONNECT behavior as well as SMTP STARTTLS.  As  a  side
              effect,  since ssldump can't tell whether plaintext is traffic before the initiation of an SSL connection or just a regular TCP con‐
              nection, this allows you to use ssldump to sniff any TCP connection.  ssldump will automatically detect ASCII data  and  display  it
              directly to the screen. non-ASCII data is displayed as hex dumps. See also -X.

       -e     Print absolute timestamps instead of relative timestamps

       -H     Print the full SSL packet header.

       -n     Don't try to resolve host names from IP addresses

       -N     Attempt to parse ASN.1 when it appears, such as in certificates and DNs.

       -p     Use password as the SSL keyfile password.

       -P     Don't put the interface into promiscuous mode.

       -q     Don't decode any record fields beyond a single summary line. (quiet mode).

       -T     Print the TCP headers.

       -v     Display version and copyright information.

       -x     Print each record in hex, as well as decoding it.

       -X     When  the -d option is used, binary data is automatically printed in two columns with a hex dump on the left and the printable char‐
              acters on the right. -X suppresses the display of the printable characters, thus making it easier to cut and paste the hex data into
              some other program.

       -y     Decorate the output for processing with nroff/troff. Not very useful for the average user.

       -i interface
              Use interface as the network interface on which to sniff SSL/TLS traffic.

       -k keyfile
              Use  keyfile  as the location of the SSL keyfile (OpenSSL format) Previous versions of ssldump automatically looked in ./server.pem.
              Now you must specify your keyfile every time.

       -p password
              Use password as the SSL keyfile password.

       -r file
              Read data from file instead of from the network.  The old -f option still works but is deprecated and will probably be removed  with
              the next version.

       -S [ crypto | d | ht | H ]
              Specify SSL flags to ssldump.  These flags include:

              crypto Print cryptographic information.

              d      Print fields as decoded.

              ht     Print the handshake type.

              H      Print handshake type and highlights.

       expression
              Selects  what packets ssldump will examine. Technically speaking, ssldump supports the full expression syntax from PCAP and tcpdump.
              In fact, the description here is cribbed from the tcpdump man page. However, since ssldump needs to examine full TCP  streams,  most
              of  the  tcpdump  expressions  will select traffic mixes that ssldump will simply ignore. Only the expressions which don't result in
              incomplete TCP streams are listed here.

              The expression consists of one or more primitives.  Primitives usually consist of an id (name or number) preceded  by  one  or  more
              qualifiers.  There are three different kinds of qualifier:

              type   qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.  Possible types are host, net and port.  E.g., `host foo',
                     `net 128.3', `port 20'.  If there is no type qualifier, host is assumed.

              dir    qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from id.  Possible directions are src, dst, src or dst  and  src
                     and dst.  E.g., `src foo', `dst net 128.3', `src or dst port ftp-data'.  If there is no dir qualifier, src or dst is assumed.
                     For `null' link layers (i.e. point to point protocols such as slip) the inbound and outbound qualifiers can be used to  spec‐
                     ify a desired direction.

              More complex filter expressions are built up by using the words and, or and not to combine primitives.  E.g., `host foo and not port
              ftp and not port ftp-data'.  To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.  E.g., `tcp  dst  port  ftp  or  ftp-data  or
              domain' is exactly the same as `tcp dst port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain'.

              Allowable primitives are:

              dst host host
                     True if the IPv4/v6 destination field of the packet is host, which may be either an address or a name.

              src host host
                     True if the IPv4/v6 source field of the packet is host.

              host host
                     True  if  either the IPv4/v6 source or destination of the packet is host.  Any of the above host expressions can be prepended
                     with the keywords, ip, arp, rarp, or ip6 as in:
                          ip host host
                     which is equivalent to:
                          ether proto \ip and host host
                     If host is a name with multiple IP addresses, each address will be checked for a match.

              ether dst ehost
                     True if the ethernet destination address is ehost.  Ehost may be either a name from /etc/ethers or a number  (see  ethers(3N)
                     for numeric format).

              ether src ehost
                     True if the ethernet source address is ehost.

              ether host ehost
                     True if either the ethernet source or destination address is ehost.

              gateway host
                     True  if  the  packet  used  host as a gateway.  I.e., the ethernet source or destination address was host but neither the IP
                     source nor the IP destination was host.  Host must be a name and must be found  in  both  /etc/hosts  and  /etc/ethers.   (An
                     equivalent expression is
                          ether host ehost and not host host
                     which can be used with either names or numbers for host / ehost.)  This syntax does not work in IPv6-enabled configuration at
                     this moment.

              dst net net
                     True if the IPv4/v6 destination address of the packet has a network number of net. Net may be either a  name  from  /etc/net‐
                     works or a network number (see networks(4) for details).

              src net net
                     True if the IPv4/v6 source address of the packet has a network number of net.

              net net
                     True if either the IPv4/v6 source or destination address of the packet has a network number of net.

              net net mask mask
                     True  if  the  IP address matches net with the specific netmask.  May be qualified with src or dst.  Note that this syntax is
                     not valid for IPv6 net.

              net net/len
                     True if the IPv4/v6 address matches net a netmask len bits wide.  May be qualified with src or dst.

              dst port port
                     True if the packet is ip/tcp, ip/udp, ip6/tcp or ip6/udp and has a destination port value of port.  The port can be a  number
                     or a name used in /etc/services (see tcp(4P) and udp(4P)).  If a name is used, both the port number and protocol are checked.
                     If a number or ambiguous name is used, only the port number is checked (e.g., dst port 513 will print both tcp/login  traffic
                     and udp/who traffic, and port domain will print both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).

              src port port
                     True if the packet has a source port value of port.

              port port
                     True if either the source or destination port of the packet is port.  Any of the above port expressions can be prepended with
                     the keywords, tcp or udp, as in:
                          tcp src port port
                     which matches only tcp packets whose source port is port.

              Primitives may be combined using:

                     A parenthesized group of primitives and operators (parentheses are special to the Shell and must be escaped).

                     Negation (`!' or `not').

                     Concatenation (`&&' or `and').

                     Alternation (`||' or `or').

              Negation has highest precedence.  Alternation and concatenation have equal precedence  and  associate  left  to  right.   Note  that
              explicit and tokens, not juxtaposition, are now required for concatenation.

              If an identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent keyword is assumed.  For example,
                   not host vs and ace
              is short for
                   not host vs and host ace
              which should not be confused with
                   not ( host vs or ace )

              Expression  arguments  can  be passed to ssldump as either a single argument or as multiple arguments, whichever is more convenient.
              Generally, if the expression contains Shell metacharacters, it is easier to pass it as a single, quoted  argument.   Multiple  argu‐
              ments are concatenated with spaces before being parsed.

EXAMPLES
       To listen to traffic on interface le0 port 443
              ssldump -i le0 port 443

       To listen to traffic to the server romeo on port 443.
              ssldump -i le0 port 443 and host romeo

       To decrypt traffic to to host romeo server.pem and the password foobar
              ssldump -Ad -k ~/server.pem -p foobar -i le0 host romeo

OUTPUT FORMAT
       All output is printed to standard out.

       ssldump prints an indication of every new TCP connection using a line like the following

       New TCP connection #2: iromeo.rtfm.com(2302) <-> sr1.rtfm.com(4433)

       The  host which send the first SYN is printed on the left and the host which responded is printed on the right. Ordinarily, this means that
       the SSL client will be printed on the left with the SSL server on the right. In this case we have a connection from  iromeo.rtfm.com  (port
       2303)  to  sr1.rtfm.com (port 4433). To allow the user to disentangle traffic from different connections, each connection is numbered. This
       is connection 2.

       The printout of each SSL record begins with a record line. This line contains the connection and record number, a timestamp, and the record
       type, as in the following:

       2 3  0.2001 (0.0749)  S>C  Handshake      Certificate

       This  is  record 3 on connection 2. The first timestamp is the time since the beginning of the connection. The second is the time since the
       previous record. Both are in seconds.

       The next field in the record line is the direction that the record was going. C>S indicates records transmitted from client to  server  and
       S>C  indicates  records transmitted from server to client.  ssldump assumes that the host to transmit the first SYN is the SSL client (this
       is nearly always correct).

       The next field is the record type, one of Handshake, IAlert, ChangeCipherSpec, or application_data. Finally, ssldump may print  record-spe‐
       cific data on the rest of the line. For Handshake records, it prints the handshake message. Thus, this record is a Certificate message.

       ssldump chooses certain record types for further decoding. These are the ones that have proven to be most useful for debugging:

       ClientHello - version, offered cipher suites, session id
                            if provided)
       ServerHello - version, session_id, chosen cipher suite,
                      compression method
       Alert - type and level (if obtainable)

       Fuller decoding of the various records can be obtained by using the -A , -d , -k and -p flags.

DECRYPTION
       ssldump can decrypt traffic between two hosts if the following two conditions are met:
              1. ssldump has the keys.
              2. Static RSA was used.
       In  any  other  case,  once  encryption starts, ssldump will only be able to determine the record type. Consider the following section of a
       trace.

       1 5  0.4129 (0.1983)  C>S  Handshake      ClientKeyExchange
       1 6  0.4129 (0.0000)  C>S  ChangeCipherSpec
       1 7  0.4129 (0.0000)  C>S  Handshake
       1 8  0.5585 (0.1456)  S>C  ChangeCipherSpec
       1 9  0.6135 (0.0550)  S>C  Handshake
       1 10 2.3121 (1.6986)  C>S  application_data
       1 11 2.5336 (0.2214)  C>S  application_data
       1 12 2.5545 (0.0209)  S>C  application_data
       1 13 2.5592 (0.0046)  S>C  application_data
       1 14 2.5592 (0.0000)  S>C  Alert

       Note that the ClientKeyExchange message type is printed but the rest of the Handshake messages do not have types. These  are  the  Finished
       messages,  but  because  they are encrypted ssldump only knows that they are of type Handshake.  Similarly, had the Alert in record 14 hap‐
       pened during the handshake, it's type and level would have been printed. However, since it is encrypted we can only  tell  that  it  is  an
       alert.

BUGS
       Please send bug reports to ssldump@rtfm.com.

       The  TCP  reassembler  is not perfect. No attempt is made to reassemble IP fragments and the 3-way handshake and close handshake are imper‐
       fectly implemented. In practice, this turns out not to be much of a problem.

       Support is provided for only for Ethernet and loopback interfaces because that's all that I have. If you have another kind of  network  you
       will need to modify pcap_cb in base/pcap-snoop.c. If you have direct experience with ssldump on other networks, please send me patches.

       ssldump doesn't implement session caching and therefore can't decrypt resumed sessions.
