DESCRIPTION
       I  wrote  this  tool  back  in late 2006 and it has been my favorite tool for enumeration thru DNS, in great part because I wrote it and it
       gives the output in a way that I can manipulate it in my own style.  One of the features that I used the most and gave me excellent results
       is the SRV record enumeration.

       The script will perform the following:
         Standard  Record  Enumeration  for  a  given  domain  (A, NS, SOA and MX).  Top Leven Domain Expansion for a given domain.  Zone Transfer
         against all NS records of a given domain.  Reverse Lookup against a given IP Range given a start and end IP.

       SRV Record enumeration, enumerating:
                 _gc._tcp.
                 _kerberos._tcp.
                 _kerberos._udp.
                 _ldap._tcp.
                 _test._tcp.
                 _sips._tcp.
                 _sip._udp.
                 _sip._tcp.
                 _aix._tcp.
                 _aix._tcp.
                 _finger._tcp.
                 _ftp._tcp.
                 _http._tcp.
                 _nntp._tcp.
                 _telnet._tcp.
                 _whois._tcp.
                 _h323cs._tcp.
                 _h323cs._udp.
                 _h323be._tcp.
                 _h323be._udp.
                 _h323ls._tcp.
                 _h323ls._udp.

       Brute force hostnames and subdomains of a given target domain using a wordlist.
