NAME
       kfind - file find utility for KDE

SYNOPSIS
       kfind [searchpath] [KDE Generic Options] [Qt Generic Options]

DESCRIPTION
       The Find Files tool is a useful method of searching for specific files on your computer, or for searching for files that match a pattern. An example of this could include searching for files of a
       particular type or with certain letters in the filename, or that contain a certain piece of text in their contents.

       KFind is a graphical tool, and not normally run from the command line.

OPTIONS
       searchpath
           You may optionally supply a colon separated path to prefill the dialog. You might use this ability to set up different icons on your panel or desktop to quickly run searches in different
           locations.
