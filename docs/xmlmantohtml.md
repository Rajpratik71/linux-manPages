NAME
       xmlmantohtml - xml to html converter

SYNOPSIS
       xmlmantohtml file.1.xml > file.1.html

DESCRIPTION
       xmlmantohtml is a small script to convert xml/man to html.

       You will find the dtd in /usr/share/xmltoman/ on a debian system. There is also an xsl file to generate html using xsltproc(1). See also /usr/share/doc/xmltoman/examples for examples.

       If xsltproc proves to be a useful alternative, this program will be obsoleted.
