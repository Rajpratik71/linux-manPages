DESCRIPTION
       partclone.dd is a part of Partclone project to clone unsupported file system with dd method. It will backup all block from partition.
       Partclone provide utilities to backup used blocks and design for higher compatibility of the file system by using existing library, e.g.
       e2fslibs is used to read the used block of ext2 partition.

       Partclone supported file system include btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, reiserfs, reiser4, xfs and jfs for LINUX. Also support some non-linux
       operation system, ex: NTFS and FAT (for Windows), HFS plus(APPLE MAC OS), UFS2(FreeBSD), VMFS(VMWare Vsphere). All partclone utils could be
       run like partclone.xxx is very smiliar fsck or mkfs. For example, for backup/restore hfsplus, just run partclone.hfsp.
