NAME
       ipa-client-install - Configure an IPA client

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-client-install [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       Configures a client machine to use IPA for authentication and identity services.

       By default this configures SSSD to connect to an IPA server for authentication and authorization. Optionally one can instead configure PAM and NSS (Name Switching Service) to work with an IPA server
       over Kerberos and LDAP.

       An authorized user is required to join a client machine to IPA. This can take the form of a kerberos principal or a one-time password associated with the machine.

       This same tool is used to unconfigure IPA and attempts to return the machine to its previous state. Part of this process is to unenroll the host from the IPA server. Unenrollment  consists  of  dis‐
       abling  the principal key on the IPA server so that it may be re-enrolled. The machine principal in /etc/krb5.keytab (host/<fqdn>@REALM) is used to authenticate to the IPA server to unenroll itself.
       If this principal does not exist then unenrollment will fail and an administrator will need to disable the host principal (ipa host-disable <fqdn>).


   Assumptions
       The ipa-client-install script assumes that the machine has already generated SSH keys. It will not generate SSH keys of its  own  accord.  If  SSH  keys  are  not  present  (e.g.  when  running  the
       ipa-client-install in a kickstart, before ever running sshd), they will not be uploaded to the client host entry on the server.


   Hostname Requirements
       Client  must  use a static hostname. If the machine hostname changes for example due to a dynamic hostname assignment by a DHCP server, client enrollment to IPA server breaks and user then would not
       be able to perform Kerberos authentication.

       --hostname option may be used to specify a static hostname that persists over reboot.


   DNS Autodiscovery
       Client installer by default tries to search for _ldap._tcp.DOMAIN DNS SRV records for all domains that are parent to its hostname. For example, if a client machine has a hostname  'client1.lab.exam‐
       ple.com', the installer will try to retrieve an IPA server hostname from _ldap._tcp.lab.example.com, _ldap._tcp.example.com and _ldap._tcp.com DNS SRV records, respectively. The discovered domain is
       then used to configure client components (e.g. SSSD and Kerberos 5 configuration) on the machine.

       When the client machine hostname is not in a subdomain of an IPA server, its domain can be passed with --domain option. In that case, both SSSD and Kerberos components have the  domain  set  in  the
       configuration files and will use it to autodiscover IPA servers.

       Client  machine  can  also  be  configured  without  a DNS autodiscovery at all. When both --server and --domain options are used, client installer will use the specified server and domain directly.
       --server option accepts multiple server hostnames which can be used for failover mechanism. Without DNS autodiscovery, Kerberos is configured with a fixed list of KDC and   Admin  servers.  SSSD  is
       still  configured  to  either  try to read domain's SRV records or the specified fixed list of servers. When --fixed-primary option is specified, SSSD will not try to read DNS SRV record at all (see
       sssd-ipa(5) for details).


   The Failover Mechanism
       When some of the IPA servers is not available, client components are able to fallback to other IPA replica and thus preserving a continued service. When client machine is configured to use  DNS  SRV
       record  autodiscovery  (no  fixed  server  was passed to the installer), client components do the fallback automatically, based on the IPA server hostnames and priorities discovered from the DNS SRV
       records.

       If DNS autodiscovery is not available, clients should be configured at least with a fixed list of IPA servers that can be used in case of a failure. When only  one  IPA  server  is  configured,  IPA
       client services will not be available in case of a failure of the IPA server. Please note, that in case of a fixed list of IPA servers, the fixed server lists in client components need to be updated
       when a new IPA server is enrolled or a current IPA server is decommissioned.


   Coexistence With Other Directory Servers
       Other directory servers deployed in the network (e.g. Microsoft Active Directory) may use the same DNS SRV records to denote hosts with a directory service (_ldap._tcp.DOMAIN). Such DNS SRV  records
       may  break  the  installation  if the installer discovers these DNS records before it finds DNS SRV records pointing to IPA servers. The installer would then fail to discover the IPA server and exit
       with error.

       In order to avoid the aforementioned DNS autodiscovery issues, the client machine hostname should be in a domain with properly defined DNS SRV records pointing to IPA servers, either manually with a
       custom  DNS  server  or with IPA DNS integrated solution. A second approach would be to avoid autodiscovery and configure the installer to use a fixed list of IPA server hostnames using the --server
       option and with a --fixed-primary option disabling DNS SRV record autodiscovery in SSSD.


   Re-enrollment of the host
       Requirements:

       1. Host has not been un-enrolled (the ipa-client-install --uninstall command has not been run).
       2. The host entry has not been disabled via the ipa host-disable command.

       If this has been the case, host can be re-enrolled using the usual methods.

       There are two method of authenticating a re-enrollment:

       1. You can use --force-join option with ipa-client-install command. This authenticates the re-enrollment using the admin's credentials provided via the -w/--password option.
       2. If providing the admin's password via the command line is not an option (e.g. you want to create a script to re-enroll a host and keep the admin's password secure), you can use backed  up  keytab
       from the previous enrollment of this host to authenticate. See --keytab option.

       Consequences of the re-enrollment on the host entry:

       1. A new host certificate is issued
       2. The old host certificate is revoked
       3. New SSH keys are generated
       4. ipaUniqueID is preserved


OPTIONS
   BASIC OPTIONS
       --domain=DOMAIN
              The primary DNS domain of an existing IPA deployment, e.g. example.com. This DNS domain should contain the SRV records generated by the IPA server installer. Usually the name is a lower-cased
              name of an IPA Kerberos realm name.

              When no --server option is specified, this domain will be used by the installer to discover all available servers via DNS SRV record autodiscovery (see DNS Autodiscovery section for details).

              The default value used by the installer is the domain part of the hostname. This option needs to be specified if the primary IPA DNS domain is different from the default value.

       --server=SERVER
              Set the FQDN of the IPA server to connect to. May be specified multiple times to add multiple servers to ipa_server value in sssd.conf or krb5.conf. Only the first value  is  considered  when
              used with --no-sssd. When this option is used, DNS autodiscovery for Kerberos is disabled and a fixed list of KDC and Admin servers is configured.

              Under normal circumstances, this option is not needed as the list of servers is retrieved from the primary IPA DNS domain.

       --realm=REALM_NAME
              The Kerberos realm of an existing IPA deployment. Usually it is an upper-cased name of the primary DNS domain used by the IPA installation.

              Under normal circumstances, this option is not needed as the realm name is retrieved from the IPA server.

       --fixed-primary
              Configure SSSD to use a fixed server as the primary IPA server. The default is to use DNS SRV records to determine the primary server to use and fall back to the server the client is enrolled
              with. When used in conjunction with --server then no _srv_ value is set in the ipa_server option in sssd.conf.

       -p, --principal
              Authorized kerberos principal to use to join the IPA realm.

       -w PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
              Password for joining a machine to the IPA realm. Assumes bulk password unless principal is also set.

       -W     Prompt for the password for joining a machine to the IPA realm.

       -k, --keytab
              Path to backed up host keytab from previous enrollment. Joins the host even if it is already enrolled.

       --mkhomedir
              Configure PAM to create a users home directory if it does not exist.

       --hostname
              The hostname of this machine (FQDN). If specified, the hostname will be set and the system configuration will be updated to persist over reboot. By default the result of getfqdn()  call  from
              Python's socket module is used.

       --force-join
              Join the host even if it is already enrolled.

       --ntp-server=NTP_SERVER
              Configure ntpd to use this NTP server. This option can be used multiple times.

       -N, --no-ntp
              Do not configure or enable NTP.

       --force-ntpd
              Stop and disable any time&date synchronization services besides ntpd.

       --nisdomain=NIS_DOMAIN
              Set the NIS domain name as specified. By default, this is set to the IPA domain name.

       --no-nisdomain
              Do not configure NIS domain name.

       --ssh-trust-dns
              Configure OpenSSH client to trust DNS SSHFP records.

       --no-ssh
              Do not configure OpenSSH client.

       --no-sshd
              Do not configure OpenSSH server.

       --no-sudo
              Do not configure SSSD as a data source for sudo.

       --no-dns-sshfp
              Do not automatically create DNS SSHFP records.

       --noac Do not use Authconfig to modify the nsswitch.conf and PAM configuration.

       -f, --force
              Force the settings even if errors occur

       --kinit-attempts=KINIT_ATTEMPTS
              In  case  of unresponsive KDC (e.g. when enrolling multiple hosts at once in a heavy load environment) repeat the request for host Kerberos ticket up to a total number of KINIT_ATTEMPTS times
              before giving up and aborting client installation. Default number of attempts is 5. The request is not repeated when there is a problem with host credentials  themselves  (e.g.  wrong  keytab
              format or invalid principal) so using this option will not lead to account lockouts.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information to stdout

       -U, --unattended
              Unattended installation. The user will not be prompted.

       --ca-cert-file=CA_FILE
              Do not attempt to acquire the IPA CA certificate via automated means, instead use the CA certificate found locally in in CA_FILE.  The CA_FILE must be an absolute path to a PEM formatted cer‐
              tificate file. The CA certificate found in CA_FILE is considered authoritative and will be installed without checking to see if it's valid for the IPA domain.

       --request-cert
              Request certificate for the machine. The certificate will be stored in /etc/ipa/nssdb under the nickname "Local IPA host".

              Using this option requires that D-Bus is properly configured or not configured at all. In environment where this condition is not met (e.g. anaconda kickstart chroot environment) set the sys‐
              tem bus address to /dev/null to enable workaround in ipa-client-install.

                  # env DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/dev/null ipa-client-install --request-cert

              Note that requesting the certificate when certmonger is not running only creates tracking request and the certmonger service must be started to be able to track certificates.

       --automount-location=LOCATION
              Configure automount by running ipa-client-automount(1) with LOCATION as automount location.

       --configure-firefox
              Configure Firefox to use IPA domain credentials.

       --firefox-dir=DIR
              Specify Firefox installation directory. For example: '/usr/lib/firefox'

       --ip-address=IP_ADDRESS
              Use IP_ADDRESS in DNS A/AAAA record for this host. May be specified multiple times to add multiple DNS records.

       --all-ip-addresses
              Create DNS A/AAAA record for each IP address on this host.


   SSSD OPTIONS
       --permit
              Configure SSSD to permit all access. Otherwise the machine will be controlled by the Host-based Access Controls (HBAC) on the IPA server.

       --enable-dns-updates
              This option tells SSSD to automatically update DNS with the IP address of this client.

       --no-krb5-offline-passwords
              Configure SSSD not to store user password when the server is offline.

       -S, --no-sssd
              Do not configure the client to use SSSD for authentication, use nss_ldap instead.

       --preserve-sssd
              Disabled  by  default.  When  enabled,  preserves  old  SSSD configuration if it is not possible to merge it with a new one. Effectively, if the merge is not possible due to SSSDConfig reader
              encountering unsupported options, ipa-client-install will not run further and ask to fix SSSD config first. When this option is not specified, ipa-client-install will back up SSSD config  and
              create new one. The back up version will be restored during uninstall.


   UNINSTALL OPTIONS
       --uninstall
              Remove the IPA client software and restore the configuration to the pre-IPA state.

       -U, --unattended
              Unattended uninstallation. The user will not be prompted.
