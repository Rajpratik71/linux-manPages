NAME
       scsi_satl - check SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) device support

SYNOPSIS
       scsi_satl [--help] [--log] [--quiet] [--verbose] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       This  bash  shell  script  calls  several  SCSI  commands  on the given DEVICE that is assumed to be an ATA device behind a SCSI to ATA Translation (SAT) layer (SATL). The results of each test and a
       pass/fail count are output.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              print out the usage message then exit.

       -L, --log
              the output to stderr (from each SCSI command executed) is appended to a file called 'scsi_satl.err' in the current working directory.

       -q, --quiet
              the amount of output is reduced and typically only the pass/fail count is output.

       -v, --verbose
              increase level or verbosity.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of this script is the number of "bad" errors found.  So an exit status of 0 means all mandatory SCSI commands worked as expected.
