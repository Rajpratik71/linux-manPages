       mkocp OTPFILE

DESCRIPTION
       mkocp is used to create or recreate Omega Compiled Process files (binary) from Omega Translation Process (text) files.

       used to change the case or hyphenation of text.

       OTPs are defined in text files, and compiled into binary code (OCPs) using mkocp (this script) or directly with otp2ocp(1).

FILES
       OTPFILE
              An Omega Typesetting Process filter file.
