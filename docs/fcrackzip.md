NAME
       fcrackzip - a Free/Fast Zip Password Cracker

SYNOPSIS
       fcrackzip   [-bDBchVvplum2]  [--brute-force]  [--dictionary]  [--benchmark]  [--charset  characterset]  [--help]  [--validate]  [--verbose]
       [--init-password string/path] [--length min-max] [--use-unzip] [--method name] [--modulo r/m] file...

DESCRIPTION
       fcrackzip searches each zipfile given for encrypted files and tries to guess the password. All files must be encrypted with the same  pass‐
       word, the more files you provide, the better.

   OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints the version number and (hopefully) some helpful insights.

       -v, --verbose
              Each -v makes the program more verbose.

       -b, --brute-force
              Select brute force mode. This tries all possible combinations of the letters you specify.

       -D, --dictionary
              Select dictionary mode. In this mode, fcrackzip will read passwords from a file, which must contain one password per line and should
              be alphabetically sorted (e.g. using sort(1)).

       -c, --charset characterset-specification
              Select the characters to use in brute-force cracking. Must be one of

                a   include all lowercase characters [a-z]
                A   include all uppercase characters [A-Z]
                1   include the digits [0-9]
                !   include [!:$%&/()=?{[]}+*~#]
                :   the following characters up to the end of the spe-
                    cification string are included in the character set.
                    This way you can include any character except binary
                    null (at least under unix).

              For example, a1:$% selects lowercase characters, digits and the dollar and percent signs.

       -p, --init-password string
              Set initial (starting) password for brute-force searching to string, or use the file with the name string to  supply  passwords  for
              dictionary searching.

       -l, --length min[-max]
              Use  an  initial  password  of  length  min, and check all passwords up to passwords of length max (including). You can omit the max
              parameter.

       -u, --use-unzip
              Try to decompress the first file by calling unzip with the guessed password. This weeds out false positives when  not  enough  files
              have been given.

       -m, --method name
              Use  method  number  "name"  instead  of  the default cracking method. The switch --help will print a list of available methods. Use
              --benchmark to see which method does perform best on your machine. The name can also be the number of the method to use.

       -2, --modulo r/m
              Calculate only r/m of the password. Not yet supported.

       -B, --benchmark
              Make a small benchmark, the output is nearly meaningless.

       -V, --validate
              Make some basic checks whether the cracker works.

ZIP PASSWORD BASICS
       Have you ever mis-typed a password for unzip? Unzip reacted pretty fast with ´incorrect password´, without decrypting the whole file. While
       the  encryption  algorithm  used  by  zip  is  relatively secure, PK made cracking easy by providing hooks for very fast password-checking,
       directly in the zip file. Understanding these is crucial to zip password cracking:

       For each password that is tried, the first twelve bytes of the file are decrypted. Depending on the version of zip used to encrypt the file
       (more  on  that later), the first ten or eleven bytes are random, followed by one or two bytes whose values are stored elsewhere in the zip
       file, i.e. are known beforehand. If these last bytes don't have the correct (known) value, the password is definitely wrong. If  the  bytes
       are  correct,  the  password might be correct, but the only method to find out is to unzip the file and compare the uncompressed length and
       crc´s.

       Earlier versions of pkzip (1.xx) (and, incidentally, many zip clones for other operating systems!) stored two known bytes. Thus  the  error
       rate  was roughly 1/2^16 = 0.01%. PKWARE ´improved´ (interesting what industry calls improved) the security of their format by only includ‐
       ing one byte, so the possibility of false passwords is now raised to 0.4%. Unfortunately, there is no real way to distinguish one byte from
       two byte formats, so we have to be conservative.

BRUTE FORCE MODE
       By  default,  brute force starts at the given starting password, and successively tries all combinations until they are exhausted, printing
       all passwords that it detects, together with a rough correctness indicator.

       The starting password given by the -p switch determines the length.  fcrackzip will not currently increase the  password  length  automati‐
       cally, unless the -l switch is used.

DICTIONARY MODE
       This  mode  is similar to brute force mode, but instead of generating passwords using a given set of characters and a length, the passwords
       will be read from a file that you have to specify using the -p switch.

CP MASK
       A CP mask is a method to obscure images or parts of images using a password.  These obscured images can be restored even when saved as JPEG
       files. In most of these files the password is actually hidden and can be decoded easily (using one of the many available viewer and masking
       programs, e.g. xv). If you convert the image the password, however, is lost. The cpmask crack method  can  be  used  to  brute-force  these
       images.  Instead  of  a zip file you supply the obscured part (and nothing else) of the image in the PPM-Image Format (xv and other viewers
       can easily do this).

       The cpmask method can only cope with password composed of uppercase letters, so be sure to supply the --charset  A  or  equivalent  option,
       together with a suitable initialization password.

EXAMPLES
       fcrackzip -c a -p aaaaaa sample.zip
              checks the encrypted files in sample.zip for all lowercase 6 character passwords (aaaaaa ... abaaba ... ghfgrg ... zzzzzz).

       fcrackzip --method cpmask --charset A --init AAAA test.ppm
              checks the obscured image test.ppm for all four character passwords.

       fcrackzip -D -p passwords.txt sample.zip
              check for every password listed in the file passwords.txt.

PERFORMANCE
       fzc,  which seems to be widely used as a fast password cracker, claims to make 204570 checks per second on my machine (measured under plain
       dos w/o memory manager).

       fcrackzip, being written in C and not in assembler, naturally is slower. Measured on a slightly loaded unix (same machine), it´s 12 percent
       slower (the compiler used was pgcc, from http://www.gcc.ml.org/).

       To  remedy this a bit, I converted small parts of the encryption core to x86 assembler (it will still compile on non x86 machines), and now
       it´s about 4-12 percent faster than fzc (again, the fcrackzip performance was measured under a multitasking os,  so  there  are  inevitably
       some meaurement errors), so there shouldn't be a tempting reason to switch to other programs.

       Further  improvements  are  definitely possible: fzc took 4 years to get into shape, while fcrackzip was hacked together in under 10 hours.
       And not to forget you have the source, while other programs (like fzc), even come as an encrypted .exe file (maybe because  their  program‐
       mers are afraid of other people could having a look at their lack of programming skills?  nobody knows...)

RATIONALE
       The  reason  I  wrote  fcrackzip  was NOT to have the fastest zip cracker available, but to provide a portable, free (thus extensible), but
       still fast zip password cracker. I was really pissed of with that dumb, nonextendable zipcrackers that were either slow, were too  limited,
       or wouldn't run in the background (say, under unix). (And you can't run them on your superfast 600Mhz Alpha).

BUGS
       No automatic unzip checking.

       Stop/resume facility is missing.

       Should be able to distinguish between files with 16 bit stored CRC´s and 8 bit stored CRC´s.

       The benchmark does not work on all systems.

       It's still early alpha.

       Method "cpmask" only accepts ppms.

       Could be faster.
