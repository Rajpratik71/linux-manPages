NAME
       ndctl - Manage "libnvdimm" subsystem devices (Non-volatile Memory)

SYNOPSIS
       ndctl [--version] [--help] [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
           Display ndctl version.

       -h, --help
           Run ndctl help command.

DESCRIPTION
       ndctl is utility for managing the "libnvdimm" kernel subsystem. The "libnvdimm" subsystem defines a kernel device model and control message interface for platform NVDIMM resources like those defined
       by the ACPI 6.0 NFIT (NVDIMM Firmware Interface Table). Operations supported by the tool include, provisioning capacity (namespaces), as well as enumerating/enabling/disabling the devices (dimms,
       regions, namspaces) associated with an NVDIMM bus.
