NAME
       hostapd - IEEE 802.11 AP, IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP/RADIUS Authenticator

SYNOPSIS
       hostapd [-hdBKtv] [-P <PID file>] <configuration file(s)>

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hostapd daemon.

       hostapd  is  a  user  space  daemon  for  access point and authentication servers.  It implements IEEE 802.11 access point management, IEEE
       802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticators and RADIUS authentication server.  The current version supports Linux (Host AP, mac80211-based  drivers)
       and FreeBSD (net80211).

       hostapd  is  designed  to  be  a "daemon" program that runs in the background and acts as the backend component controlling authentication.
       hostapd supports separate frontend programs and an example text-based frontend, hostapd_cli, is included with hostapd.
