NAME
       lsmem - list the ranges of available memory with their online status

SYNOPSIS
       lsmem [options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  lsmem  command  lists the ranges of available memory with their online status. The listed memory blocks correspond to the memory block representation in sysfs. The command also shows the
       memory block size and the amount of memory in online and offline state.

       The default output compatible with original implementaion from s390-tools, but it's strongly recommended to avoid using default outputs in your scripts.   Always  explicitly  define  expected
       columns by using the --output option together with a columns list in environments where a stable output is required.

       Not all columns are supported on all systems.  If an unsupported column is specified, lsmem prints the column but does not provide any data for it.

       Use the --help option to see the columns description.

OPTIONS
       -a, --all
              List each individual memory block, instead of combining memory blocks with similar attributes.

       -b, --bytes
              Print the SIZE column in bytes rather than in a human-readable format.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -J, --json
              Use JSON output format.

       -n, --noheadings
              Do not print a header line.

       -o, --output list
              Specify  which  output columns to print.  Use --help to get a list of all supported columns.  The default list of columns may be extended if list is specified in the format +list (e.g.
              lsmem -o +NODE).

       -P, --pairs
              Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs.  All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       -r, --raw
              Produce output in raw format.  All potentially unsafe characters are hex-escaped (\x<code>).

       -s, --sysroot directory
              Gather memory data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which the lsmem command is issued.  The specified directory is  the  system  root  of  the  Linux  instance  to  be
              inspected.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       --summary[=when]
              This option controls summary lines output.  The optional argument when can be never, always or only.  If the when argument is omitted, it defaults to "only". The summary output is sup‐
              presed for --raw, --pairs and --json.
