GXL2GV,GV2GXL(1)                                              General Commands Manual                                             GXL2GV,GV2GXL(1)

NAME
       gxl2gv,gv2gxl - GXL-GV converters

SYNOPSIS
       gxl2gv [ -gd?  ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]
       gv2gxl [ -gd?  ] [ -ooutfile ] [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       gxl2gv  converts  between graphs represented in GXL and in the GV language. Unless a conversion type is specified using a flag, gxl2gv will
       deduce the type of conversion from the suffix of the input file, a ".gv" suffix causing a conversion from GV to GXL, and  a  ".gxl"  suffix
       causing  a  conversion  from  GXL  to GV.  If no suffix is available, e.g. when the input is from a pipe, and no flags are used then gxl2gv
       assumes the type of the input file from its executable name so that gxl2gv converts from GXL to GV, and gv2gxl converts from GV to GXL.

       GXL supports a much richer graph model than GV. gxl2gv will attempt to map GXL constructs into the analogous GV construct when this is pos‚Äê
       sible.  If  not,  the GXL information is stored as an attribute. The intention is that applying gxl2gv|gv2gxl is semantically equivalent to
       the identity operator.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -g     The command name and input file extensions are ignored, the input is taken as a GV file and a GXL file is generated.

       -d     The command name and input file extensions are ignored, the input is taken as a GXL file and a GV file is generated.

       -?     Prints usage information and exits.

       -o outfile
              If specified, the output will be written into the file outfile. Otherwise, output is written to standard out.

OPERANDS
       The following operand is supported:

       files   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in GXL or GV.  If no files operand is specified, the standard input will be used.

RETURN CODES
       Both gxl2gv and gv2gxl return 0 if there were no problems during conversion; and non-zero if any error occurred.

BUGS
       gxl2gv will only convert in one direction even if given multiple files with varying suffixes.

       The conversion can only handle one graph per GXL file.

       There are some GXL constructs which gxl2gv cannot handle.
