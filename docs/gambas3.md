NAME
       gambas - Integrated Development Environment.

SYNOPSIS
       gambas [<project file or project directory>]

DESCRIPTION
       Gambas  is,  before  all,  a Basic language with object extensions.  A program written with Gambas is a set of files. Each file describes a
       class, in terms of object programming. The class files are compiled, then executed by an interpreter. From this point of view, it  is  very
       inspired by Java.

       Gambas is made up of the following programs:

           * A compiler.
           * An interpreter.
           * An archiver.
           * A graphical user interface component.
           * A development environment.

       The  development  environment  is  written  with Gambas itself, so that I can show the abilities of the language. And it is very useful for
       debugging!

       gambas starts the Integrated Development Environment.
