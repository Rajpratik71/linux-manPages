NAME
       mkfs.bfs - make an SCO bfs filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mkfs.bfs [options] device [block-count]

DESCRIPTION
       mkfs.bfs creates an SCO bfs filesystem on a block device (usually a disk partition or a file accessed via the loop device).

       The block-count parameter is the desired size of the filesystem, in blocks.  If nothing is specified, the entire partition will be used.

OPTIONS
       -N, --inodes number
              Specify the desired number of inodes (at most 512).  If nothing is specified, some default number in the range 48â€“512 is picked depending on the size of the partition.

       -V, --vname label
              Specify the volume label.  I have no idea if/where this is used.

       -F, --fname name
              Specify the filesystem name.  I have no idea if/where this is used.

       -v, --verbose
              Explain what is being done.

       -c     This option is silently ignored.

       -l     This option is silently ignored.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.  Option -V only works as --version when it is the only option.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code returned by mkfs.bfs is 0 when all went well, and 1 when something went wrong.
