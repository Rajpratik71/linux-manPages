UNBURDEN-HOME-DIR(1)                                       Unburden Your Home Directory                                       UNBURDEN-HOME-DIR(1)

NAME
       unburden-home-dir - unburdens home directories from caches and trashes

SYNOPSIS
       unburden-home-dir [ -n | -u | -f filter ]
       unburden-home-dir ( -h | --help | --version )

DESCRIPTION
       unburden-home-dir  unburdens  the  home  directory from files and directory which cause high I/O or disk usage but are neither important if
       they are lost, e.g. caches or trash directory.

       When being run it moves the files and directories given in the configuration file to a location outside the home directory,  e.g.  /tmp  or
       /scratch, and puts appropriate symbolic links in the home directory instead.

OPTIONS
       -b     use the given string as basename instead of "unburden-home-dir".

       -c     read an additional configuration file.

       -C     read only the given configuration file

       -f     just  unburden  those directory matched by the given filter (a perl regular expression) - it matches the already unburdened directo‐
              ries if used together with -u.

       -F     Do not check for files in use with lsof before (re)moving files.

       -l     read an additional list file

       -L     read only the given list file

       -n     dry run (show what would be done)

       -u     undo (reverse the functionality and put stuff back into the home directory)

       -h, --help
              show this help

       --version
              show the program´s version

       Of, course, du(1) can help you to find potential files or directories to handle by unburden-home-dir, but there are quite  some  du(1)-like
       tools  out  there  which  are  way more comfortable, e.g. ncdu(1) (text-mode), baobab(1) (GNOME), filelight(1) (KDE), xdiskusage(1) (X tool
       calling du(1) itself), or xdu(1) (X tool reading du(1) output from STDIN).
