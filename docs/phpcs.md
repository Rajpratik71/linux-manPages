DESCRIPTION
       phpcs (or PHP_CodeSniffer) is a PHP5 script that tokenises PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard.
       It  is  an  essential  development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent.  It can also help prevent some common semantic
       errors made by developers.

PARAMETERS
       file

       extensions

              A comma separated list of file extensions to check (extension filtering only valid when checking a directory).  The type of the file
              can be specified using: ext/type e.g., module/php,es/js

       generator

              Uses either the "HMTL", "Markdown" or "Text" generator (forces documentation generation instead of checking)

              Write the report to the specified file path

       reportWidth

              How many columns wide screen reports should be printed or set to "auto" to use current screen width, where supported

       sniffs

              A comma separated list of sniff codes to limit the check to (all sniffs must be part of the specified standard)

       severity

              The minimum severity required to display an error or warning

       standard

              The name or path of the coding standard to use
