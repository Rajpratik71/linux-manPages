NAME
       ecryptfs-setup-private - setup an eCryptfs private directory.

SYNOPSIS
       ecryptfs-setup-private  [-f|--force]  [-w|--wrapping]  [-b|--bootstrap]  [-n|--no-fnek]  [--nopwcheck] [-u|--username USER] [-l|--loginpass
       LOGINPASS] [-m|--mountpass MOUNTPASS]

OPTIONS
       Options available for the ecryptfs-setup-private command:

       -f, --force
              Force overwriting of an existing setup

       -w, --wrapping
              Use an independent wrapping passphrase, different from the login passphrase

       -u, --username USER
              User to setup, default is current user if omitted

       -l, --loginpass LOGINPASS
              System passphrase for USER, used to wrap MOUNTPASS, will interactively prompt if omitted

       -m, --mountpass MOUNTPASS
              Passphrase for mounting the ecryptfs directory, default is 16 bytes from /dev/random if omitted

       -b, --bootstrap
              Bootstrap a new user's entire home directory

       --undo Display instructions on how to undo an encrypted private setup

       -n, --no-fnek
              Do not encrypt filenames; otherwise, filenames will be encrypted on systems which support filename encryption

       --nopwcheck
              Do not check the validity of the specified login password (useful for LDAP user accounts)

       --noautomount
              Setup this user such that the encrypted private directory is not automatically mounted on login

       --noautoumount
              Setup this user such that the encrypted private directory is not automatically unmounted at logout

DESCRIPTION
       ecryptfs-setup-private is a program that sets up a private cryptographic mountpoint for a non-root user.

       Be sure to properly escape your parameters according to your shell's special character nuances, and also surround the parameters by  double
       quotes, if necessary. Any of the parameters may be:

         1) exported as environment variables
         2) specified on the command line
         3) left empty and interactively prompted

       The  user  SHOULD  ABSOLUTELY  RECORD THE MOUNT PASSPHRASE AND STORE IN A SAFE LOCATION.  If the mount passphase file is lost, or the mount
       passphrase is forgotten, THERE IS NO WAY TO RECOVER THE ENCRYPTED DATA.

       Using the values of USER, MOUNTPASS, and LOGINPASS, ecryptfs-setup-private will:
         - Create ~/.Private (permission 700)
         - Create ~/Private (permission 500)
         - Backup any existing wrapped passphrases
         - Use LOGINPASS to wrap and encrypt MOUNTPASS
         - Write to ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase
         - Add the passphrase to the current keyring
         - Write the passphrase signature to ~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig
         - Test the cryptographic mount with a few reads and writes

       The system administrator can add the pam_ecryptfs.so module to the PAM stack which will automatically use the login  passphrase  to  unwrap
       the mount passphrase, add the passphrase to the user's kernel keyring, and automatically perform the mount. See pam_ecryptfs(8).

FILES
       ~/.ecryptfs/auto-mount

       ~/.Private - underlying directory containing encrypted data

       ~/Private - mountpoint containing decrypted data (when mounted)

       ~/.ecryptfs/Private.sig - file containing signature of mountpoint passphrase

       ~/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt - file containing path of the private directory mountpoint

       ~/.ecryptfs/wrapped-passphrase - file containing the mount passphrase, wrapped with the login passphrase

       ~/.ecryptfs/wrapping-independent - this file exists if the wrapping passphrase is independent from login passphrase
