NAME
       openvas-nasl - Nessus Attack Scripting Language

SYNOPSIS
       openvas-nasl <[-vh] [-T tracefile] [-s] [-t target] [-c config_file] [-d] [-sX] > files...

DESCRIPTION
       openvas-nasl  executes  a set of NASL scripts against a given target host. It can also be used to determine if a NASL script has any syntax
       errors by running it in parse (-p) or lint (-L) mode.

OPTIONS
       -T tracefile
              Makes nasl write verbosely what the script does in the file tracefile , ala 'set -x' under sh

       -t target
              Apply the NASL script to target which may be a  single  host  (127.0.0.1),  a  whole  subnet  (192.168.1.0/24)  or  several  subnets
              (192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.243.0/24)

       -e iface
              Specifies the network interface to be used as the source for established connections.

       -s     Sets the return value of safe_checks() to 1. (See the OpenVAS documentation to know what the safe checks are) Implies -B.

       -D     Only run the description part of the script.

       -B     Runs in description mode before running the script.

       -L     Lint the script  (run extended checks).

       -X     Run the script in authenticated mode. For more information see the nasl reference manual

       -h     Show help

       -v     Show the version of NASL.

       -d     Output debug information to stderr.

       -k key=value
              Set KB key to vaue. Can be used multiple times.

HISTORY
       NASL  comes from a private project called 'pkt_forge', which was written in late 1998 by Renaud Deraison and which was an interactive shell
       to forge and send raw IP packets (this pre-dates Perl's Net::RawIP by a couple of weeks). It was then extended to do a wide range  of  net‚Äê
       work-related operations and integrated into Nessus as 'NASL'.

       The  parser was completely hand-written and a pain to work with. In Mid-2002, Michel Arboi wrote a bison parser for NASL, and he and Renaud
       Deraison re-wrote NASL from scratch. Although the "new" NASL was nearly working as early as August 2002, Michel's laziness made us wait for
       early 2003 to have it working completely.
