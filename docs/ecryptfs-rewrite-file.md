NAME
       ecryptfs-rewrite-file - force a file to be rewritten (reencrypted) in the lower filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       ecryptfs-rewrite-file [file1] [file2] [file3] ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  script takes one or more files/directories/symlinks as arguments, moves each of them to a temporary file, and then moves them back to
       the original name.  This causes the file to be rewritten (and reencrypted) in the lower filesystem.

       This script may be combined with find(1) and xargs(1) to rewrite an entire eCryptfs mountpoint, unmount, and sync:

         find . -xdev -print0 | xargs -r -0 /usr/bin/ecryptfs-rewrite-file
         ecryptfs-umount-private
         sync

       It is advised that this script is executed in runlevel 1 or 3, to avoid simultanteous writes and race conditions with targeted files.

       USING THIS SCRIPT WHILE GNOME, KDE, OR OTHER APPLICATIONS ARE RUNNING MAY CAUSE DATA LOSS.

SEE ALSO
       find(1), xargs(1), ecryptfs-umount-private(1), sync(1)
