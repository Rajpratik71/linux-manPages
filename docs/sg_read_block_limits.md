SYNOPSIS
       sg_read_block_limits [--help] [--hex] [--raw] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Send a SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS command to DEVICE and outputs the response. This command is defined for tape (drives) and its description is found in the SSC documents at http://www.t10.org .

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_read_block_limits is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.

EXAMPLES
       It is usually okay to use no options. Here is an invocation (on the first line following the "#" command prompt) followed by some typical output:

          # sg_read_block_limits /dev/st0
       Read Block Limits results:
               Minimum block size: 1 byte(s)
               Maximum block size: 16777215 byte(s), 16383 KB, 15 MB
