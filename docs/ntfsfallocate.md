NAME
       ntfsfallocate - preallocate space to a file on an NTFS volume

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsfallocate [options] -l length device file [attr-type [attr-name]]

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsfallocate preallocates space for any attribute of a file or directory, thus reserving space before actual contents is written. This is similar to fallocate(1).

OPTIONS
       Below  is  a  summary  of all the options that ntfsfallocate accepts.  Nearly all options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by - and the long name is preceded by --.  Any
       single letter options, that don't take an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v.  Long named options can be abbreviated to  any  unique  prefix  of
       their name.

       -f, --force
              This will override some sensible defaults, such as not using a mounted volume.  Use this option with caution.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

       -l, --length LENGTH
              This  is  a mandatory option to specify the number of bytes to preallocate.  It will be rounded up to a multiple of the cluster size.  A suffix of K, M, G, T, P or E may be appended to
              mean a multiplicative factor of a power of 1000. Similarly a suffix of Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi or Ei may be appended to mean a multiplicative factor of a power of 1024.

       -n, --no-size-change
              Do not change the apparent size of the file. The space allocated beyond the apparent size is not zeroed, but subsequent writing beyond the apparent end of file will force  zeroing  the
              inner allocated space as it cannot be considered as a hole any more, and this may take significant time.

       -N, --no-action
              Simulate the allocation without actually write to device.

       -o, --offset OFFSET
              Specify  the offset in the file where preallocation starts. By default, the preallocation is counted from the beginning of the file. Space already allocated in the area defined by off‐
              set and length is preserved.

       -q, --quiet
              Suppress some debug/warning/error messages.

       -v, --verbose
              Display more debug/warning/error messages.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number, copyright and license of ntfsfallocate.

       attr-type
              Define a particular attribute type to be preallocated (advanced use only).  By default, the unnamed $DATA attribute (the contents of a plain file) will be preallocated.  The  attribute
              has to be specified by a number in decimal or hexadecimal :

              ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
              │Hex     Decimal   Name                     │

              └───────────────────────────────────────────┘

       attr-name
              Define the name of the particular attribute type to be preallocated (advanced use only).

EXAMPLES
       Preallocate 100MB to the file database.db located in the Data directory which is at the root of an NTFS file system.

              ntfsfallocate -l 100M /dev/sda1 Data/database.db

BUGS
       There  are  no  known problems with ntfsfallocate, however it can lead to configurations not supported by Windows and Windows may crash (BSOD) when writing to preallocated clusters which were
       not written to earlier. Files with preallocated space should be fully be written to before they are updated by Windows.

       If you find a bug in ntfsfallocate proper, please send an email describing the problem to the development team:
       ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net
