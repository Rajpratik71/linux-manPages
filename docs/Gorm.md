NAME
       Gorm - Graphical Objects Relationship Modeler

SYNOPSIS
       Gorm [.gorm...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the Gorm command.

       Gorm  is a clone of the InterfaceBuilder in NeXTSTEP.  It allows the creation of GNUstep graphical application interfaces which can be eas‐
       ily done with drag & drop operations.  With Gorm one can create and edit a lot of GUI elements: windows, menus, buttons,  labels,  sliders,
       tables,  textfields, browsers, images, altert panels and more.  Custom palettes can be loaded to provide additional elements or functional‐
       ity.  Object connections are typically made by using the mouse and are encoded in the .gorm file so minimal code is required.

       Gorm is usually used in conjunction with ProjectCenter(1) to create complete applications.

OPTIONS
       Like most GNUstep applications there are no options.  Gorm will load the .gorm files specified on the command line.

SEE ALSO
       GNUstep(7), ProjectCenter(1)
