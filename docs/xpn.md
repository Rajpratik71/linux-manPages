NAME
       xpn - graphical newsreader written in Python with the GTK+ toolkit

SYNOPSIS
       xpn [-d | --home_dir]

       xpn [-c | --custom_dir= {directory}]

       xpn [-h | --help]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the xpn command.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page. Instead, it has
       documentation in the GNU info(1) format; see below.

       xpn is a graphical newsreader written in Python with the GTK+ toolkit.

       With XPN you can read/write articles on the Usenet with a good MIME support. XPN can operate with all the most diffuse charset starting
       from US-ASCII to UTF-8. When you edit an article XPN automatically chooses the best charset, however is always possible to override this
       choice.

       There also other useful features like scoring, filtered views, random tag-lines, external editor support, one-key navigation, ROT13,
       spoiler char, ...
