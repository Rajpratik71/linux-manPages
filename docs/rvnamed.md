NAME
       rvnamed - reverse name resolution daemon for iptraf(8)

DESCRIPTION
       rvnamed  is  a  supplementary  program  distributed  with  iptraf.   This  is a reverse name resolution daemon used by iptraf to resolve IP
       addresses to host names in the background, keeping iptraf from waiting until the lookup is completed.

       This program is only used by iptraf and, therefore, is useless alone.
