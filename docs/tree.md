       [--device] [--noreport] [--dirsfirst] [--version] [--help] [--filelimit #] [--si] [--prune] [--du] [--timefmt  format]  [--matchdirs]  [--]
       [directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tree  is  a  recursive  directory  listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files, which is colorized ala dircolors if the
       LS_COLORS environment variable is set and output is to tty.  With no arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory.  When direc‐
       tory  arguments  are  given,  tree  lists all the files and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of
       listing all files/directories found, tree returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

       By default, when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the symbolic link refers to is printed after the name of  the  link  in  the
       format:

           name -> real-path

       If  the `-l' option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual directory, then tree will follow the path of the symbolic link as if
       it were a real directory.

OPTIONS
       Tree understands the following command line switches:

LISTING OPTIONS
       -a     All files are printed.  By default tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot `.').  In no event does  tree  print
              the file system constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previous directory).

       -d     List directories only.

       -l     Follows  symbolic  links if they point to directories, as if they were directories. Symbolic links that will result in recursion are
              avoided when detected.

       -f     Prints the full path prefix for each file.

       -x     Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala find -xdev.

       -L level
              Max display depth of the directory tree.

       -R     Recursively cross down the tree each level directories (see -L  option),  and  at  each  of  them  execute  tree  again  adding  `-o
              00Tree.html' as a new option.

       -P pattern
              List  only  those  files  that match the wild-card pattern.  Note: you must use the -a option to also consider those files beginning
              with a dot `.'  for matching.  Valid wildcard operators are `*' (any zero or more characters), `?' (any single  character),  `[...]'
              (any single character listed between brackets (optional - (dash) for character range may be used: ex: [A-Z]), and `[^...]' (any sin‐
              gle character not listed in brackets) and `|' separates alternate patterns.

       -I pattern
              Do not list those files that match the wild-card pattern.

        .TP --ignore-case If a match pattern is specified by the -P or -I option, this will cause the pattern to match without regards to the case
       of each letter.

       --matchdirs
              If a match pattern is specified by the -P option, this will cause the pattern to be applied to directory names (in addition to file‐
              names).  In the event of a match on the directory name, matching is disabled for the directory's contents. If the --prune option  is
              used, empty folders that match the pattern will not be pruned.

       --prune
              Makes  tree  prune  empty  directories from the output, useful when used in conjunction with -P or -I.  See BUGS AND NOTES below for
              more information on this option.

       --noreport
              Omits printing of the file and directory report at the end of the tree listing.

       --charset charset
              Set the character set to use when outputting HTML and for line drawing.

       --filelimit #
              Do not descend directories that contain more than # entries.

       --timefmt format
              Prints (implies -D) and formats the date according to the format string which uses the strftime(3) syntax.

       -o filename
              Send output to filename.

FILE OPTIONS
       -q     Print non-printable characters in filenames as question marks instead of the default.

       -N     Print non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal numbers.

       -Q     Quote the names of files in double quotes.

       -p     Print the file type and permissions for each file (as per ls -l).

       -u     Print the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the file.

       -g     Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of the file.

       -s     Print the size of each file in bytes along with the name.

       -h     Print the size of each file but in a more human readable way, e.g. appending a size letter for kilobytes (K), megabytes  (M),  giga‐
              bytes (G), terabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).

       --si   Like -h but use SI units (powers of 1000) instead.

       --du   For  each  directory report its size as the accumulation of sizes of all its files and sub-directories (and their files, and so on).
              The total amount of used space is also given in the final report (like the 'du -c' command.) This option requires tree to  read  the
              entire directory tree before emitting it, see BUGS AND NOTES below.  Implies -s.

       -D     Print the date of the last modification time or if -c is used, the last status change time for the file listed.

       -F     Append a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for executable files, a `>' for doors (Solaris) and a `|' for FIFO's, as
              per ls -F

       --inodes
              Prints the inode number of the file or directory

       --device
              Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs

SORTING OPTIONS
       -v     Sort the output by version.

       -t     Sort the output by last modification time instead of alphabetically.

       -c     Sort the output by last status change instead of alphabetically.  Modifies the -D option (if used) to print the last  status  change
              instead of modification time.

       -U     Do not sort.  Lists files in directory order. Disables --dirsfirst.

       -r     Sort the output in reverse order.  This is a meta-sort that alter the above sorts.  This option is disabled when -U is used.

       --dirsfirst
              List directories before files. This is a meta-sort that alters the above sorts.  This option is disabled when -U is used.

       --sort[=]<name>
              Sort the output by name (as per ls): name (default), ctime (-c), mtime (-t), size or version (-v).

GRAPHICS OPTIONS
       -i     Makes  tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction with the -f option.  Also removes as much whitespace as
              possible when used with the -J or -x options.

       -A     Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the indentation lines.

       -S     Turn on CP437 line graphics (useful when using Linux console mode fonts). This option is now equivalent  to  `--charset=IBM437'  and
              may eventually be depreciated.

       -n     Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the -C option.

       -C     Turn  colorization  on  always,  using built-in color defaults if the LS_COLORS environment variable is not set.  Useful to colorize
              output to a pipe.

XML/JSON/HTML OPTIONS
       -X     Turn on XML output. Outputs the directory tree as an XML formatted file.

       -J     Turn on JSON output. Outputs the directory tree as an JSON formatted array.

       -H baseHREF
              Turn on HTML output, including HTTP references. Useful for ftp sites.  baseHREF gives the base ftp location when using HTML  output.
              That  is,  the  local  directory  may  be  `/local/ftp/pub',  but  it must be referenced as `ftp://hostname.organization.domain/pub'
              (baseHREF should be `ftp://hostname.organization.domain'). Hint: don't use ANSI lines with this option, and don't give more than one
              directory  in  the  directory  list.  If you wish to use colors via CCS style-sheet, use the -C option in addition to this option to
              force color output.

       -T title
              Sets the title and H1 header string in HTML output mode.

       --nolinks
              Turns off hyperlinks in HTML output.

MISC OPTIONS
       --help Outputs a verbose usage listing.

       --version
              Outputs the version of tree.

       --     Option processing terminator.  No further options will be processed after this.

FILES
       /etc/DIR_COLORS          System color database.
       ~/.dircolors        Users color database.

ENVIRONMENT
       LS_COLORS      Color information created by dircolors
       TREE_COLORS    Uses this for color information over LS_COLORS if it is set.
       TREE_CHARSET   Character set for tree to use in HTML mode.
       LC_CTYPE       Locale for filename output.
       LC_TIME        Locale for timefmt output, see strftime(3).
       TZ             Timezone for timefmt output, see strftime(3).

BUGS AND NOTES
       Tree does not prune "empty" directories when the -P and -I options are used by default. Use the --prune option.

       The -h and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls implementations which rounds up always.

       Pruning files and directories with the -I, -P and --filelimit options will lead to incorrect file/directory count reports.

       The --prune and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree in memory before emitting it. For  large  directory  trees  this  can
       cause a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The timefmt expansion buffer is limited to a ridiculously large 255 characters.  Output of time strings longer than this will be undefined,
       but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.
