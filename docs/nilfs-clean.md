NILFS-CLEAN(8)                                                System Manager's Manual                                               NILFS-CLEAN(8)

NAME
       nilfs-clean - run garbage collector on NILFS file system

SYNOPSIS
       nilfs-clean [options] [device]

DESCRIPTION
       The  nilfs-clean  program communicates with nilfs_cleanerd(8) program and controls execution of garbage collection (GC) on NILFS2 file sys‐
       tems.  It can be used to manually run garbage collection of a file system mounted on device to increase the free space.

       If a GC command is specified by one of the following options (i.e. ´-c´,´-s´,´-r´, and ´-l´ options), the command is sent to and  performed
       on the nilfs_cleanerd(8) program.  If no commands are specified, nilfs-clean just triggers a one-pass cleaning.

       When device is omitted, nilfs-clean selects an active NILFS2 file system in the system.

       This command is valid only for mounted NILFS2 file systems, and will fail if the device has no active mounts.

OPTIONS
       -b, --break, --stop
              Stop garbage collection.

       -c, --reload[=conffile]
              Request reloading config file to cleaner process.  If an optional configuration file is given, the file is read by nilfs_cleanerd(8)
              program and cleaner configuration is reset to the  information.   If  no  argument  is  given,  a  configuration  file  selected  by
              nilfs_cleanerd(8) will be reloaded.

       -l, --status
              Display cleaner status.

       -h, --help
              Display help message and exit.

       -m, --min-reclaimable-blocks=COUNT[%]
              Specify  the  minimum  number  of reclaimable blocks in a segment before it can be cleaned. If the argument is followed by a percent
              sign, it represents the ratio of blocks in a segment. This argument will only have an effect if the use_set_suinfo flag  is  set  in
              the configuration file.

       -p, --protection-period=interval
              Set  protection period for a cleaner run.  The interval parameter is an integer value and specifies the minimum time that deleted or
              overrode data will be preserved in the file system.  Smaller values will increase free space made by  garbage  collection.   Option‐
              ally, the interval parameter may be suffixed by one of the following units designators: ´s´, ´m´, ´h´, ´d´,´w´,´M´, or ´Y´, for sec‐
              onds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years, respectively.

       -q, --quit
              Shutdown cleaner daemon.

       -r, --resume
              Resume garbage collection.

       -s, --suspend
              Suspend garbage collection.  Note that if users manually suspend garbage collection with this option, it will not restart  automati‐
              cally until user resumes the garbage collection.

       -S, --speed=COUNT[/SECONDS]
              Set garbage collection speed for a cleaner run.

       -v, --verbose
              Verbose mode.

       -V, --version
              Display version and exit.
