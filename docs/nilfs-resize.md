NAME
       nilfs-resize - resize NILFS file system volume size

SYNOPSIS
       nilfs-resize [options] device [size]

DESCRIPTION
       The  nilfs-resize  program  will  resize NILFS2 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink a mounted file system located on device.
       This feature is only available on the kernel supporting on-line resizing.  Resizing  for  unmounted  file  systems  are  not  supported  at
       present.

       The size parameter specifies the requested new size of the filesystem.  The size of the filesystem may never be larger than the size of the
       partition.  Optionally, the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the following units designators: ´s´, ´K´, ´M´, ´G´, or ´T´,  for  512
       byte sectors, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes, respectively.  If size parameter is not specified, it will default to the size
       of the partition.

       This program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must make sure you can expand  the  size
       of the underlying partition first.  This can be done using fdisk(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using
       lvextend(8), if you are using the logical volume manager lvm(8)

       If you wish to shrink a nilfs2 partition, first use nilfs-resize to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the
       size  of  the  partition.   When  shrinking the size of the partition, make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size of the nilfs2
       filesystem.

       This command is valid only for mounted NILFS2 file systems, and will fail if the device has no active mounts.
