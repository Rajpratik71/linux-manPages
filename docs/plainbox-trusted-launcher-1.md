NAME
       plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 - execute job command as another user

SYNOPSIS
          plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 [-h] (-w | -t CHECKSUM)
                                      [-T NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]] [-g CHECKSUM]
                                      [-G NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Security elevation mechanism for plainbox

       This command is a part of the implementation of plainbox. It is not intended to be invoked directly and the command line arguments and behavior may freely change between versions.

       Technically  this  program  is  used  to  run a command associated with a job definition as another user (typically as root). The existing technologies such as sudo (8) and pkexec (1) don't have
       enough granularity to still restrict arbitrary commands but allow the commands that are inside system-wide installed locations (thus safe as one needs root access to install those in  the  first
       place). One additional restriction is that some commands are themselves generated by other jobs.

   Execution
   Warm-up Mode
       If  the  --warmup option is specified then nothing more happens and the program exists immediately. This is intended to 'warm-up' the tool that executes plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 itself (typi‐
       cally pkexec or sudo)

   Normal Execution
       In normal execution mode, the launcher looks up the job with the checksum specified by --target and executes the command embedded inside. Environment passed via --target-environment is  appended
       to the environment variables inherited from the parent process.

       Standard output, standard error and exit code of plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 is exactly as the values from the commands embedded into the selected job itself.

   Indirect Execution
       In indirect execution mode, the launcher first looks up the job with the checksum specified by --generator, executes it, discarding stderr and re-interpreting stdout as a set of job definitions.
       Environment passed via the --generator-environment is appended (but just to the generator job, the --target job has independent environment). All of the additional job definitions are  added  to
       the global pool of jobs the launcher knows about.

       After that the launcher continues as with normal execution, returning the same stdout, stderr and exit code.

OPTIONS
       Optional arguments:

       -w, --warmup
              return immediately, only useful when used with pkexec(1)

       -t, --target
              run a job with this checksum

       -T, --target-environment
              environment passed to the target job

       -g, --generator
              also run a job with this checksum (assuming it is a local job)

       -G, --generator-environment
              environment passed to the generator job

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables DO NOT affect plainbox-trusted-launcher-1

       PROVIDERPATH
                 For plainbox this would affect the set of directories where Plainbox looks for provider definitions. The trusted launcher has a fixed list of directories that cannot be extended.

                 The fixed list is composed of two system-wide locations:

                 · /usr/local/share/plainbox-providers-1

                 · /usr/share/plainbox-providers-1

              All the other environment variables mentioned in plainbox work the same way.

BUGS
       Currently  it  is impossible to use plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 with a local job needs to run as root, that generates another local job that needs to run as root, to generate any additional jobs
       that also need to run as root. In other words, only one-level job generation is supported.

       The launcher is somewhat inefficient, in that it has to re-run all of the dependencies of the local job over and over. Ideally those would be cached, per-session, but  that  would  significantly
       increase the complexity of the code running as root.
