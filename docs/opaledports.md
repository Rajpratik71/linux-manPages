                 Specifies the file listing the links to process. The list is of the form:


                 NodeGUID;PortNum;NodeType;NodeDesc;NodeGUID;PortNum;
                 NodeType;NodeDesc;Dontcare

Examples
       echo "0x001175010165ac1d;1;FI;phkpstl035 hfi1_0"|opaledports on
       opaledports on < portlist.csv
