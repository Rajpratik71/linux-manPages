axfrdns-conf(8)                                               System Manager's Manual                                              axfrdns-conf(8)

NAME
       axfrdns-conf - sets up a DNS zone-transfer service.

SYNOPSIS
       axfrdns-conf acct logacct D tiny ip

DESCRIPTION
       axfrdns-conf  creates  a service directory D that runs axfrdns(8) under tcpserver(1).  The name D must start with a slash and must not con‚Äê
       tain any special characters.  Normally D is /etc/axfrdns.

       You can run the service under svscan(8) by using the update-service(8) program on Debian GNU/Linux

       update-service --add D

       or by creating a symbolic link in the svscan(8) directory (normally /service or /etc/service), e.g.:

       ln -s D /service

       The service will start within five seconds, and will be restarted upon reboot.  You can use svc(8) to control the service.

       axfrdns-conf arranges for tcpserver(1) to listen for TCP connections on port 53 of ip.  It sets up D/tcp in tcprules(1) format  to  control
       access to axfrdns(8); initially all access is denied.  It also sets up D/Makefile to compile tcp into tcp.cdb for tcpserver(1).

       axfrdns-conf  arranges  for  axfrdns(8)  to  chroot to tiny/root and to run under the uid and gid of acct.  The name tiny must start with a
       slash and must not contain any special characters; normally it is /etc/tinydns.  The name acct must not contain any special characters.

       axfrdns-conf creates an automatically rotated log directory in D/log/main.  The logs are owned by logacct.  The  corresponding  multilog(8)
       processes run under the uid and gid of logacct.  The name logacct must not contain any special characters.
