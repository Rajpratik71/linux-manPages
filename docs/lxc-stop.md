lxc-stop(1)                                                                               lxc-stop(1)

NAME
       lxc-stop - stop the application running inside a container

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-stop {-n name} [-W] [-r] [-t timeout] [-k] [--nokill] [--nolock]

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-stop  reboots, cleanly shuts down, or kills all the processes inside the container. By de‐
       fault, it will request a clean shutdown of the container by sending lxc.signal.halt  (defaults
       to  SIGPWR) to the container's init process, waiting up to 60 seconds for the container to ex‐
       it, and then returning. If the container fails to cleanly exit in 60 seconds, it will be  sent
       the  lxc.signal.stop  (defaults to SIGKILL) to force it to shut down. A request to reboot will
       send the lxc.signal.reboot (defaults to SIGINT) to the container's init process.

       The [-W], [-r], [-k] and [--nokill] options specify the action  to  perform.   [-W]  indicates
       that  after performing the specified action, lxc-stop should immediately exit, while [-t TIME‐
       OUT] specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the container to complete  the  shutdown
       or reboot.

OPTIONS
       -r,--reboot
              Request a reboot of the container.

       -k,--kill
              Rather  than requesting a clean shutdown of the container, explicitly kill all tasks in
              the container. This is the legacy lxc-stop behavior.

       --nokill
              Only request a clean shutdown, do not kill the container tasks if  the  clean  shutdown
              fails.

       --nolock
              This  option  avoids  the use of any of the API lxc locking, and should only be used if
              lxc-stop is hanging due to a bad system state.

       -W,--nowait
              Simply perform the requestion action (reboot, shutdown, or hard kill) and exit.

       -t,--timeout TIMEOUT
              Wait TIMEOUT seconds before hard-stopping the container.

EXIT VALUE
       0      The container was successfully stopped.

       1      An error occurred while stopping the container.

       2      The specified container exists but was not running.

DIAGNOSTIC
       The container was not found
              The specified container was not created before with the lxc-create command.
