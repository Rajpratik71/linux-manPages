DESCRIPTION
       lxc-copy  creates  and  optionally starts (ephemeral or non-ephemeral) copies of existing con‐
       tainers.

       lxc-copy creates copies of existing containers. Copies can be complete clones of the  original
       container. In this case the whole root filesystem of the container is simply copied to the new
       container. Or they can be snapshots, i.e. small copy-on-write copies of the original  contain‐
       er.  In this case the specified backing storage for the copy must support snapshots. This cur‐
       rently includes btrfs, lvm (lvm devices do not support snapshots of snapshots.), overlay,  and
       zfs.

       The  copy's  backing storage will be of the same type as the original container. overlay snap‐
       shots of directory backed containers are exempted from this rule.

       When the -e flag is specified an ephemeral snapshot of the original container is  created  and
       started. Ephemeral containers will have lxc.ephemeral = 1 set in their config file and will be
       destroyed on shutdown. When -e is used in combination with -D a non-ephemeral snapshot of  the
       original container is created and started.  Ephemeral containers can also be placed on a tmpfs
       with -t flag. NOTE: If an ephemeral container that is  placed  on  a  tmpfs  is  rebooted  all
       changes made to it will currently be lost!

       When  -e  is  specified  and no newname is given via -N a random name for the snapshot will be
       chosen.

       Containers created and started with -e can have custom mounts. These are specified with the -m
       flag.  Currently  two types of mounts are supported: bind, and overlay. Mount types are speci‐
       fied as suboptions to the -m flag and can be specified multiple  times  separated  by  commas.
       overlay  mounts  are currently specified in the format -m overlay=/src:/dest. When no destina‐
       tion dest is specified dest will be identical to src. Read-only bind mounts are  specified  -m
       bind=/src:/dest:ro  and  read-write  bind mounts -m bind=/src:/dest:rw. Read-write bind mounts
       are the default and rw can be missing when a read-write mount is wanted. When dest is  missing
       dest   will   be   identical   to   src.   An   example   for  multiple  mounts  would  be  -m
       bind=/src1:/dest1:ro,bind=/src2:ro,overlay=/src3:/dest3.

       The mounts, their options, and formats supported via the -m flag are subject to change.

OPTIONS
       -N,--newname newname
              The name for the copy.

       -p,--newpath newpath
              The path for the copy.

       -R,--rename
              Rename the original container.

       -s,--snapshot
              Create a snapshot of the original container. The backing storage for the copy must sup‐
              port snapshots. This currently includes btrfs, lvm, overlay, and zfs.

       -F,--foreground
              Run  the snapshot in the foreground. The snapshots console will be attached to the cur‐
              rent tty. (This option can only be specified in conjunction with -e.)

       -d, --daemon
              Run the snapshot as a daemon (This is the default mode for ephemeral  containers.).  As
              the  container  has  no more tty, if an error occurs nothing will be displayed, the log
              file can be used to check the error. (This option can only be specified in  conjunction
              with -e.)

       -m, --mount mounttype
              Specify  a  mount  for  a  snapshot The opts argument for the mount type can by of type
              {bind, overlay}. For example -m bind=/src:/dest:ro,overlay=/src:/dest (This option  can
              currently only be specified in conjunction with -e.).

       -t, --tmpfs
              When  this option is specified the ephemeral container will be placed on a tmpfs. NOTE:
              Rebooting an ephemeral container that is located on a tmpfs will  currently  cause  all
              changes made to it to be lost. This flag will only work for ephemeral containers creat‐
              ed with the -e flag. The original container, from which the ephemeral snapshot is  cre‐
              ated, must be stored as a simple directory.

       -B, --backingstorage backingstorage
              Specify  the  backing storage type to be used for the copy where 'backingstorage' is of
              type 'btrfs', 'dir', 'lvm', 'loop', 'overlay', or 'zfs'.

       -L, --fssize size [unit]
              Specify the size for an 'lvm' filesystem.

       -K, --keepname
              When this option is specified the hostname of the original container will be  kept  for
              the copy.

       -D, --keepdata
              When this option is specified with -e a non-ephemeral container is created and started.

       -M, --keepmac
              When  this  option  is specified the MAC address of the original container will be kept
              for the copy.

COPY HOOK
       If the container being copied has one or more lxc.hook.clone  specified,  then  the  specified
       hooks  will  be  called  for the new container. The first 3 arguments passed to the clone hook
       will be the container name, a section ('lxc'), and the hook type  ('clone').  Extra  arguments
       passed  to  lxc-copy  will  be  passed  to  the  hook  program  starting  at  argument  4. The
       LXC_ROOTFS_MOUNT environment variable gives the path under which the container's root filesys‐
       tem is mounted. The configuration file pathname is stored in LXC_CONFIG_FILE, the new contain‐
       er name in LXC_NAME, the old container name in LXC_SRC_NAME, and the path or device  on  which
       the rootfs is located is in LXC_ROOTFS_PATH.

COMMON OPTIONS
       These options are common to most of lxc commands.

       -?, -h, --help
              Print a longer usage message than normal.

       --usage
              Give the usage message

       -q, --quiet
              mute on

       -P, --lxcpath=PATH
              Use an alternate container path. The default is /var/lib/lxc.

       -o, --logfile=FILE
              Output to an alternate log FILE. The default is no log.

       -l, --logpriority=LEVEL
              Set log priority to LEVEL. The default log priority is ERROR. Possible values are : FA‐
              TAL, CRIT, WARN, ERROR, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG.

              Note that this option is setting the priority of the events log in  the  alternate  log
              file. It do not have effect on the ERROR events log on stderr.

       -n, --name=NAME
              Use  container  identifier  NAME.   The  container identifier format is an alphanumeric
              string.

       --rcfile=FILE
              Specify the configuration file to configure the virtualization and isolation  function‐
              alities for the container.

              This  configuration  file if present will be used even if there is already a configura‐
              tion file present in the previously created container (via lxc-create).

       --version
              Show the version number.
