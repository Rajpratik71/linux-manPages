NAME
       ansible-vault - encryption/decryption utility for Ansible data files

SYNOPSIS
       usage: ansible-vault [-h] [--version] [-v]
              {create,decrypt,edit,view,encrypt,encrypt_string,rekey} ...

DESCRIPTION
       can  encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible.  This can include group_vars/ or host_vars/ inventory variables, variables loaded by
       include_vars or vars_files, or variable files passed on the ansible- playbook command line with -e @file.yml or -e @file.json.  Role  vari‐
       ables and defaults are also included!

       Because  Ansible  tasks,  handlers,  and  other objects are data, these can also be encrypted with vault.  If you'd like to not expose what
       variables you are using, you can keep an individual task file entirely encrypted.
