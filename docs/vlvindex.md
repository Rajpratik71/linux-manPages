NAME
       vlvindex - Directory Server script for VLV indexing

SYNOPSIS
       vlvindex [-Z serverID] -n backendname | {-s includesuffix}* -T vlvTag [-d debuglevel] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  virtual  list view (VLV) indexes, known in the Directory Server Console as browsing indexes. VLV indexes introduce flexibility in the way search results are viewed.  VLV index configuration

       -s includeSuffix
