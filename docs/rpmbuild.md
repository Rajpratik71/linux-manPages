DESCRIPTION
       rpmbuild  is  used  to  build  both  binary  and source software packages.  A package consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to
       install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes helper scripts, file attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
       Packages  come  in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages, containing the source
       code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.

       One of the following basic modes must be selected: Build Package, Build Package from Tarball, Recompile Package, Show Configuration.

   GENERAL OPTIONS
       These options can be used in all the different modes.

       -?, --help
              Print a longer usage message then normal.

       --version
              Print a single line containing the version number of rpm being used.

       --quiet
              Print as little as possible - normally only error messages will be displayed.

       -v     Print verbose information - normally routine progress messages will be displayed.

       -vv    Print lots of ugly debugging information.

       --rcfile FILELIST
              Each of the files in the colon separated FILELIST is read sequentially by rpm for configuration information.  Only the first file in
              the    list    must   exist,   and   tildes   will   be   expanded   to   the   value   of   $HOME.    The   default   FILELIST   is
              /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc.

       --pipe CMD
              Pipes the output of rpm to the command CMD.

       --dbpath DIRECTORY
              Use the database in DIRECTORY rather than the default path /var/lib/rpm

       --root DIRECTORY
              Use the file system tree rooted at DIRECTORY for all operations.  Note that this means the database within DIRECTORY  will  be  used
              for  dependency  checks  and  any  scriptlet(s)  (e.g.   %post  if  installing, or %prep if building, a package) will be run after a
              chroot(2) to DIRECTORY.

       -D, --define='MACRO EXPR'
              Defines MACRO with value EXPR.

   BUILD OPTIONS
       The general form of an rpm build command is

       rpmbuild -bSTAGE|-tSTAGE [      rpmbuild-options
        ] FILE ...

       The argument used is -b if a spec file is being used to build the package and -t if rpmbuild should look inside of a (possibly  compressed)
       tar  file  for the spec file to use. After the first argument, the next character (STAGE) specifies the stages of building and packaging to
       be done and is one of:

       -ba    Build binary and source packages (after doing the %prep, %build, and %install stages).

       -bb    Build a binary package (after doing the %prep, %build, and %install stages).

       -bp    Executes the "%prep" stage from the spec file. Normally this involves unpacking the sources and applying any patches.

       -bc    Do the "%build" stage from the spec file (after doing the %prep stage).  This generally involves the equivalent of a "make".

       -bi    Do the "%install" stage from the spec file (after doing the %prep and %build stages).  This generally involves the equivalent  of  a
              "make install".

       -bl    Do a "list check".  The "%files" section from the spec file is macro expanded, and checks are made to verify that each file exists.

       -bs    Build just the source package.

       The following options may also be used:

       --buildroot DIRECTORY
              When building a package, override the BuildRoot tag with directory DIRECTORY.

       --clean
              Remove the build tree after the packages are made.

       --nobuild
              Do not execute any build stages. Useful for testing out spec files.

       --noclean
              Do not execute %clean build stage even if present in spec.

       --nocheck
              Do not execute %check build stage even if present in spec.

       --nodeps
              Do not verify build dependencies.

       --rmsource
              Remove the sources after the build (may also be used standalone, e.g. "rpmbuild --rmsource foo.spec").

       --rmspec
              Remove the spec file after the build (may also be used standalone, eg. "rpmbuild --rmspec foo.spec").

       --short-circuit
              Skip  straight  to  specified  stage  (i.e., skip all stages leading up to the specified stage).  Only valid with -bc, -bi, and -bb.
              Useful for local testing only.  Packages built this way will be marked with an unsatisfiable dependency to prevent their  accidental
              use.

       --target PLATFORM
              When  building  the package, interpret PLATFORM as arch-vendor-os and set the macros %_target, %_target_cpu, and %_target_os accord‚Äê
              ingly.

   REBUILD AND RECOMPILE OPTIONS
       There are two other ways to invoke building with rpm:

       rpmbuild --rebuild|--recompile SOURCEPKG ...

       When invoked this way, rpmbuild installs the named source package, and does a prep, compile and install.  In addition, --rebuild  builds  a
       new  binary package. When the build has completed, the build directory is removed (as in --clean) and the the sources and spec file for the
       package are removed.

   SHOWRC
       The command

       rpmbuild --showrc

       shows the values rpmbuild will use for all of the options are currently set in rpmrc and macros configuration file(s).

FILES
   rpmrc Configuration
       /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc
       /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc
       /etc/rpmrc
       ~/.rpmrc

   Macro Configuration
       /usr/lib/rpm/macros
       /usr/lib/rpm/redhat/macros
       /etc/rpm/macros
       ~/.rpmmacros

   Temporary
       /var/tmp/rpm*

       rpmbuild --help - as rpm supports customizing the options via popt aliases it's impossible to guarantee that what's described in the manual
       matches what's available.
