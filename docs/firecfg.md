NAME
       Firecfg - Desktop integration utility for Firejail software.

SYNOPSIS
       firecfg [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       Firecfg  is  the desktop integration utility for Firejail sandbox.  It allows the user to sandbox applications automatically by clicking on
       desktop manager icons and menus.

       The integration covers:

              - programs started in a terminal - typing "firefox" would be enough to start a sandboxed Firefox browser

              - programs started by clicking on desktop manager menus - all major desktop managers are supported

              - programs started by clicking on file icons in file manager - only Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE/LXQT, MATE and  XFCE  desktop  managers  are
              supported in this moment

       To set it up, run "sudo firecfg" after installing Firejail software.  The same command should also be run after installing new programs. If
       the program is supported by Firejail, the symbolic link in /usr/local/bin will be created. For a full list of programs supported by default
       run "cat /usr/lib/firejail/firecfg.config".

       For user-driven manual integration, see DESKTOP INTEGRATION section in man 1 firejail.

DEFAULT ACTIONS
       The following actions are implemented by default by running sudo firecfg:

              - set or update the symbolic links for desktop integration;

              - add the current user to Firejail user access database (firecfg --add-users);

              - fix desktop files in $HOME/.local/share/applications/ (firecfg --fix).

OPTIONS
       --add-users user [user]
              Add the list of users to Firejail user access database.

              Example:
              $ sudo firecfg --add-users dustin lucas mike eleven

       --bindir=directory
              Create  and  search  symbolic links in directory instead of the default location /user/local/bin.  Directory should precede /usr/bin
              and /bin in the PATH environment variable.

       --clean
              Remove all firejail symbolic links.

       --fix  Fix .desktop files. Some .desktop files use full path to executable. Firecfg will check .desktop files in  /usr/share/applications/,
              replace  full  path  by name if it is in PATH, and write result to $HOME/.local/share/applications/.  This action is done by default
              when running "sudo firecfg". We have it as a separate option for regular users.

       --fix-sound
              Create a proper ~/.config/pulse/client.conf file without shm support. On some  PulseAudio  versions,  shared  memory  support  (shm)
              breaks  the  process  ID namespace. PulseAudio software was designed a long time ago, and the introduction of PID namespace in Linux
              kernel breaks their design. This was reportedly fixed in PulseAudio version 9. If you  have  sound  problems  on  your  system,  run
              "firecfg --fix-sound" command in a terminal, followed by logout/login in order to apply the changes.

       --debug
              Print debug messages.

       -?, --help
              Print options end exit.

       --list List all firejail symbolic links

       --version
              Print program version and exit.

       Example:

       $ sudo firecfg
       /usr/local/bin/firefox created
       /usr/local/bin/vlc created
       [...]
       $ firecfg --list
       /usr/local/bin/firefox
       /usr/local/bin/vlc
       [...]
       $ sudo firecfg --clean
       /usr/local/bin/firefox removed
       /usr/local/bin/vlc removed
       [...]
