NAME
       qemu-doc - QEMU version 2.12.0 User Documentation

SYNOPSIS
       qemu-system-i386 [options] [disk_image]

DESCRIPTION
       The QEMU PC System emulator simulates the following peripherals:

       -   i440FX host PCI bridge and PIIX3 PCI to ISA bridge

       -   Cirrus CLGD 5446 PCI VGA card or dummy VGA card with Bochs VESA extensions (hardware level, including all non standard modes).

       -   PS/2 mouse and keyboard

       -   2 PCI IDE interfaces with hard disk and CD-ROM support

       -   Floppy disk

       -   PCI and ISA network adapters

       -   Serial ports

       -   IPMI BMC, either and internal or external one

       -   Creative SoundBlaster 16 sound card

       -   ENSONIQ AudioPCI ES1370 sound card

       -   Intel 82801AA AC97 Audio compatible sound card

       -   Intel HD Audio Controller and HDA codec

       -   Adlib (OPL2) - Yamaha YM3812 compatible chip

       -   Gravis Ultrasound GF1 sound card

       -   CS4231A compatible sound card

       -   PCI UHCI, OHCI, EHCI or XHCI USB controller and a virtual USB-1.1 hub.

       SMP is supported with up to 255 CPUs.

       QEMU uses the PC BIOS from the Seabios project and the Plex86/Bochs LGPL VGA BIOS.

       QEMU uses YM3812 emulation by Tatsuyuki Satoh.

       QEMU uses GUS emulation (GUSEMU32 <http://www.deinmeister.de/gusemu/>) by Tibor "TS" Sch√ºtz.

       Note that, by default, GUS shares IRQ(7) with parallel ports and so QEMU must be told to not have parallel ports to have working GUS.

               qemu-system-i386 dos.img -soundhw gus -parallel none

       Alternatively:

               qemu-system-i386 dos.img -device gus,irq=5

       Or some other unclaimed IRQ.

       CS4231A is the chip used in Windows Sound System and GUSMAX products

OPTIONS
       disk_image is a raw hard disk image for IDE hard disk 0. Some targets do not need a disk image.

       Standard options

       -h  Display help and exit

       -version
           Display version information and exit

       -machine [type=]name[,prop=value[,...]]
           Select the emulated machine by name. Use "-machine help" to list available machines.

           For architectures which aim to support live migration compatibility across releases, each release will introduce a new versioned
           machine type. For example, the 2.8.0 release introduced machine types "pc-i440fx-2.8" and "pc-q35-2.8" for the x86_64/i686
           architectures.

           To allow live migration of guests from QEMU version 2.8.0, to QEMU version 2.9.0, the 2.9.0 version must support the "pc-i440fx-2.8"
           and "pc-q35-2.8" machines too. To allow users live migrating VMs to skip multiple intermediate releases when upgrading, new releases of
           QEMU will support machine types from many previous versions.

           Supported machine properties are:

           accel=accels1[:accels2[:...]]
               This is used to enable an accelerator. Depending on the target architecture, kvm, xen, hax, hvf, whpx or tcg can be available. By
               default, tcg is used. If there is more than one accelerator specified, the next one is used if the previous one fails to
               initialize.

           kernel_irqchip=on|off
               Controls in-kernel irqchip support for the chosen accelerator when available.

           gfx_passthru=on|off
               Enables IGD GFX passthrough support for the chosen machine when available.

           vmport=on|off|auto
               Enables emulation of VMWare IO port, for vmmouse etc. auto says to select the value based on accel. For accel=xen the default is
               off otherwise the default is on.

           kvm_shadow_mem=size
               Defines the size of the KVM shadow MMU.

           dump-guest-core=on|off
               Include guest memory in a core dump. The default is on.

           mem-merge=on|off
               Enables or disables memory merge support. This feature, when supported by the host, de-duplicates identical memory pages among VMs
               instances (enabled by default).

           aes-key-wrap=on|off
               Enables or disables AES key wrapping support on s390-ccw hosts. This feature controls whether AES wrapping keys will be created to
               allow execution of AES cryptographic functions.  The default is on.

           dea-key-wrap=on|off
               Enables or disables DEA key wrapping support on s390-ccw hosts. This feature controls whether DEA wrapping keys will be created to
               allow execution of DEA cryptographic functions.  The default is on.

           nvdimm=on|off
               Enables or disables NVDIMM support. The default is off.

           s390-squash-mcss=on|off
               Enables or disables squashing subchannels into the default css.  The default is off.  NOTE: This property is deprecated and will be
               removed in future releases.  The "s390-squash-mcss=on" property has been obsoleted by allowing the cssid to be chosen freely.
               Instead of squashing subchannels into the default channel subsystem image for guests that do not support multiple channel
               subsystems, all devices can be put into the default channel subsystem image.

           enforce-config-section=on|off
               If enforce-config-section is set to on, force migration code to send configuration section even if the machine-type sets the
               migration.send-configuration property to off.  NOTE: this parameter is deprecated. Please use -global
               migration.send-configuration=on|off instead.

           memory-encryption=
               Memory encryption object to use. The default is none.

       -cpu model
           Select CPU model ("-cpu help" for list and additional feature selection)

       -accel name[,prop=value[,...]]
           This is used to enable an accelerator. Depending on the target architecture, kvm, xen, hax, hvf, whpx or tcg can be available. By
           default, tcg is used. If there is more than one accelerator specified, the next one is used if the previous one fails to initialize.

           thread=single|multi
               Controls number of TCG threads. When the TCG is multi-threaded there will be one thread per vCPU therefor taking advantage of
               additional host cores. The default is to enable multi-threading where both the back-end and front-ends support it and no
               incompatible TCG features have been enabled (e.g. icount/replay).

       -smp [cpus=]n[,cores=cores][,threads=threads][,sockets=sockets][,maxcpus=maxcpus]
           Simulate an SMP system with n CPUs. On the PC target, up to 255 CPUs are supported. On Sparc32 target, Linux limits the number of
           usable CPUs to 4.  For the PC target, the number of cores per socket, the number of threads per cores and the total number of sockets
           can be specified. Missing values will be computed. If any on the three values is given, the total number of CPUs n can be omitted.
           maxcpus specifies the maximum number of hotpluggable CPUs.

       -numa node[,mem=size][,cpus=firstcpu[-lastcpu]][,nodeid=node]
       -numa node[,memdev=id][,cpus=firstcpu[-lastcpu]][,nodeid=node]
       -numa dist,src=source,dst=destination,val=distance
       -numa cpu,node-id=node[,socket-id=x][,core-id=y][,thread-id=z]
           Define a NUMA node and assign RAM and VCPUs to it.  Set the NUMA distance from a source node to a destination node.

           Legacy VCPU assignment uses cpus option where firstcpu and lastcpu are CPU indexes. Each cpus option represent a contiguous range of
           CPU indexes (or a single VCPU if lastcpu is omitted). A non-contiguous set of VCPUs can be represented by providing multiple cpus
           options. If cpus is omitted on all nodes, VCPUs are automatically split between them.

           For example, the following option assigns VCPUs 0, 1, 2 and 5 to a NUMA node:

                   -numa node,cpus=0-2,cpus=5

           cpu option is a new alternative to cpus option which uses socket-id|core-id|thread-id properties to assign CPU objects to a node using
           topology layout properties of CPU.  The set of properties is machine specific, and depends on used machine type/smp options. It could
           be queried with hotpluggable-cpus monitor command.  node-id property specifies node to which CPU object will be assigned, it's required
           for node to be declared with node option before it's used with cpu option.

           For example:

                   -M pc \
                   -smp 1,sockets=2,maxcpus=2 \
                   -numa node,nodeid=0 -numa node,nodeid=1 \
                   -numa cpu,node-id=0,socket-id=0 -numa cpu,node-id=1,socket-id=1

           mem assigns a given RAM amount to a node. memdev assigns RAM from a given memory backend device to a node. If mem and memdev are
           omitted in all nodes, RAM is split equally between them.

           mem and memdev are mutually exclusive. Furthermore, if one node uses memdev, all of them have to use it.

           source and destination are NUMA node IDs.  distance is the NUMA distance from source to destination.  The distance from a node to
           itself is always 10. If any pair of nodes is given a distance, then all pairs must be given distances. Although, when distances are
           only given in one direction for each pair of nodes, then the distances in the opposite directions are assumed to be the same. If,
           however, an asymmetrical pair of distances is given for even one node pair, then all node pairs must be provided distance values for
           both directions, even when they are symmetrical. When a node is unreachable from another node, set the pair's distance to 255.

           Note that the -numa option doesn't allocate any of the specified resources, it just assigns existing resources to NUMA nodes. This
           means that one still has to use the -m, -smp options to allocate RAM and VCPUs respectively.

       -add-fd fd=fd,set=set[,opaque=opaque]
           Add a file descriptor to an fd set.  Valid options are:

           fd=fd
               This option defines the file descriptor of which a duplicate is added to fd set.  The file descriptor cannot be stdin, stdout, or
               stderr.

           set=set
               This option defines the ID of the fd set to add the file descriptor to.

           opaque=opaque
               This option defines a free-form string that can be used to describe fd.

           You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:

                   qemu-system-i386
                   -add-fd fd=3,set=2,opaque="rdwr:/path/to/file"
                   -add-fd fd=4,set=2,opaque="rdonly:/path/to/file"
                   -drive file=/dev/fdset/2,index=0,media=disk

       -set group.id.arg=value
           Set parameter arg for item id of type group

       -global driver.prop=value
       -global driver=driver,property=property,value=value
           Set default value of driver's property prop to value, e.g.:

                   qemu-system-i386 -global ide-hd.physical_block_size=4096 disk-image.img

           In particular, you can use this to set driver properties for devices which are created automatically by the machine model. To create a
           device which is not created automatically and set properties on it, use -device.

           -global driver.prop=value is shorthand for -global driver=driver,property=prop,value=value.  The longhand syntax works even when driver
           contains a dot.

       -boot [order=drives][,once=drives][,menu=on|off][,splash=sp_name][,splash-time=sp_time][,reboot-timeout=rb_timeout][,strict=on|off]
           Specify boot order drives as a string of drive letters. Valid drive letters depend on the target architecture. The x86 PC uses: a, b
           (floppy 1 and 2), c (first hard disk), d (first CD-ROM), n-p (Etherboot from network adapter 1-4), hard disk boot is the default. To
           apply a particular boot order only on the first startup, specify it via once. Note that the order or once parameter should not be used
           together with the bootindex property of devices, since the firmware implementations normally do not support both at the same time.

           Interactive boot menus/prompts can be enabled via menu=on as far as firmware/BIOS supports them. The default is non-interactive boot.

           A splash picture could be passed to bios, enabling user to show it as logo, when option splash=sp_name is given and menu=on, If
           firmware/BIOS supports them. Currently Seabios for X86 system support it.  limitation: The splash file could be a jpeg file or a BMP
           file in 24 BPP format(true color). The resolution should be supported by the SVGA mode, so the recommended is 320x240, 640x480,
           800x640.

           A timeout could be passed to bios, guest will pause for rb_timeout ms when boot failed, then reboot. If rb_timeout is '-1', guest will
           not reboot, qemu passes '-1' to bios by default. Currently Seabios for X86 system support it.

           Do strict boot via strict=on as far as firmware/BIOS supports it. This only effects when boot priority is changed by bootindex options.
           The default is non-strict boot.

                   # try to boot from network first, then from hard disk
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot order=nc
                   # boot from CD-ROM first, switch back to default order after reboot
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot once=d
                   # boot with a splash picture for 5 seconds.
                   qemu-system-i386 -boot menu=on,splash=/root/boot.bmp,splash-time=5000

           Note: The legacy format '-boot drives' is still supported but its use is discouraged as it may be removed from future versions.

       -m [size=]megs[,slots=n,maxmem=size]
           Sets guest startup RAM size to megs megabytes. Default is 128 MiB.  Optionally, a suffix of "M" or "G" can be used to signify a value
           in megabytes or gigabytes respectively. Optional pair slots, maxmem could be used to set amount of hotpluggable memory slots and
           maximum amount of memory. Note that maxmem must be aligned to the page size.

           For example, the following command-line sets the guest startup RAM size to 1GB, creates 3 slots to hotplug additional memory and sets
           the maximum memory the guest can reach to 4GB:

                   qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1G,slots=3,maxmem=4G

           If slots and maxmem are not specified, memory hotplug won't be enabled and the guest startup RAM will never increase.

       -mem-path path
           Allocate guest RAM from a temporarily created file in path.

       -mem-prealloc
           Preallocate memory when using -mem-path.

       -k language
           Use keyboard layout language (for example "fr" for French). This option is only needed where it is not easy to get raw PC keycodes
           (e.g. on Macs, with some X11 servers or with a VNC or curses display). You don't normally need to use it on PC/Linux or PC/Windows
           hosts.

           The available layouts are:

                   ar  de-ch  es  fo     fr-ca  hu  ja  mk     no  pt-br  sv
                   da  en-gb  et  fr     fr-ch  is  lt  nl     pl  ru     th
                   de  en-us  fi  fr-be  hr     it  lv  nl-be  pt  sl     tr

           The default is "en-us".

       -audio-help
           Will show the audio subsystem help: list of drivers, tunable parameters.

       -soundhw card1[,card2,...] or -soundhw all
           Enable audio and selected sound hardware. Use 'help' to print all available sound hardware.

                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw sb16,adlib disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw es1370 disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw ac97 disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw hda disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw all disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -soundhw help

           Note that Linux's i810_audio OSS kernel (for AC97) module might require manually specifying clocking.

                   modprobe i810_audio clocking=48000

       -balloon virtio[,addr=addr]
           Enable virtio balloon device, optionally with PCI address addr. This option is deprecated, use --device virtio-balloon instead.

       -device driver[,prop[=value][,...]]
           Add device driver.  prop=value sets driver properties.  Valid properties depend on the driver.  To get help on possible drivers and
           properties, use "-device help" and "-device driver,help".

           Some drivers are:

       -device ipmi-bmc-sim,id=id[,slave_addr=val][,sdrfile=file][,furareasize=val][,furdatafile=file]
           Add an IPMI BMC.  This is a simulation of a hardware management interface processor that normally sits on a system.  It provides a
           watchdog and the ability to reset and power control the system.  You need to connect this to an IPMI interface to make it useful

           The IPMI slave address to use for the BMC.  The default is 0x20.  This address is the BMC's address on the I2C network of management
           controllers.  If you don't know what this means, it is safe to ignore it.

           bmc=id
               The BMC to connect to, one of ipmi-bmc-sim or ipmi-bmc-extern above.

           slave_addr=val
               Define slave address to use for the BMC.  The default is 0x20.

           sdrfile=file
               file containing raw Sensor Data Records (SDR) data. The default is none.

           fruareasize=val
               size of a Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) area.  The default is 1024.

           frudatafile=file
               file containing raw Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory data. The default is none.

       -device ipmi-bmc-extern,id=id,chardev=id[,slave_addr=val]
           Add a connection to an external IPMI BMC simulator.  Instead of locally emulating the BMC like the above item, instead connect to an
           external entity that provides the IPMI services.

           A connection is made to an external BMC simulator.  If you do this, it is strongly recommended that you use the "reconnect=" chardev
           option to reconnect to the simulator if the connection is lost.  Note that if this is not used carefully, it can be a security issue,
           as the interface has the ability to send resets, NMIs, and power off the VM.  It's best if QEMU makes a connection to an external
           simulator running on a secure port on localhost, so neither the simulator nor QEMU is exposed to any outside network.

           See the "lanserv/README.vm" file in the OpenIPMI library for more details on the external interface.

       -device isa-ipmi-kcs,bmc=id[,ioport=val][,irq=val]
           Add a KCS IPMI interafce on the ISA bus.  This also adds a corresponding ACPI and SMBIOS entries, if appropriate.

           bmc=id
               The BMC to connect to, one of ipmi-bmc-sim or ipmi-bmc-extern above.

           ioport=val
               Define the I/O address of the interface.  The default is 0xca0 for KCS.

           irq=val
               Define the interrupt to use.  The default is 5.  To disable interrupts, set this to 0.

       -device isa-ipmi-bt,bmc=id[,ioport=val][,irq=val]
           Like the KCS interface, but defines a BT interface.  The default port is 0xe4 and the default interrupt is 5.

       -name name
           Sets the name of the guest.  This name will be displayed in the SDL window caption.  The name will also be used for the VNC server.
           Also optionally set the top visible process name in Linux.  Naming of individual threads can also be enabled on Linux to aid debugging.

       -uuid uuid
           Set system UUID.

       Block device options

       -fda file
       -fdb file
           Use file as floppy disk 0/1 image.

       -hda file
       -hdb file
       -hdc file
       -hdd file
           Use file as hard disk 0, 1, 2 or 3 image.

       -cdrom file
           Use file as CD-ROM image (you cannot use -hdc and -cdrom at the same time). You can use the host CD-ROM by using /dev/cdrom as
           filename.

       -blockdev option[,option[,option[,...]]]
           Define a new block driver node. Some of the options apply to all block drivers, other options are only accepted for a specific block
           driver. See below for a list of generic options and options for the most common block drivers.

           Options that expect a reference to another node (e.g. "file") can be given in two ways. Either you specify the node name of an already
           existing node (file=node-name), or you define a new node inline, adding options for the referenced node after a dot
           (file.filename=path,file.aio=native).

           A block driver node created with -blockdev can be used for a guest device by specifying its node name for the "drive" property in a
           -device argument that defines a block device.

           Valid options for any block driver node:
               "driver"
                   Specifies the block driver to use for the given node.

               "node-name"
                   This defines the name of the block driver node by which it will be referenced later. The name must be unique, i.e. it must not
                   match the name of a different block driver node, or (if you use -drive as well) the ID of a drive.

                   If no node name is specified, it is automatically generated. The generated node name is not intended to be predictable and
                   changes between QEMU invocations.  For the top level, an explicit node name must be specified.

               "read-only"
                   Open the node read-only. Guest write attempts will fail.

               "cache.direct"
                   The host page cache can be avoided with cache.direct=on. This will attempt to do disk IO directly to the guest's memory. QEMU
                   may still perform an internal copy of the data.

               "cache.no-flush"
                   In case you don't care about data integrity over host failures, you can use cache.no-flush=on. This option tells QEMU that it
                   never needs to write any data to the disk but can instead keep things in cache. If anything goes wrong, like your host losing
                   power, the disk storage getting disconnected accidentally, etc. your image will most probably be rendered unusable.

               "discard=discard"
                   discard is one of "ignore" (or "off") or "unmap" (or "on") and controls whether "discard" (also known as "trim" or "unmap")
                   requests are ignored or passed to the filesystem. Some machine types may not support discard requests.

               "detect-zeroes=detect-zeroes"
                   detect-zeroes is "off", "on" or "unmap" and enables the automatic conversion of plain zero writes by the OS to driver specific
                   optimized zero write commands. You may even choose "unmap" if discard is set to "unmap" to allow a zero write to be converted
                   to an "unmap" operation.

           Driver-specific options for "file"
               This is the protocol-level block driver for accessing regular files.

               "filename"
                   The path to the image file in the local filesystem

               "aio"
                   Specifies the AIO backend (threads/native, default: threads)

               "locking"
                   Specifies whether the image file is protected with Linux OFD / POSIX locks. The default is to use the Linux Open File
                   Descriptor API if available, otherwise no lock is applied.  (auto/on/off, default: auto)

               Example:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=disk,filename=disk.img

           Driver-specific options for "raw"
               This is the image format block driver for raw images. It is usually stacked on top of a protocol level block driver such as "file".

               "file"
                   Reference to or definition of the data source block driver node (e.g. a "file" driver node)

               Example 1:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=disk_file,filename=disk.img
                       -blockdev driver=raw,node-name=disk,file=disk_file

               Example 2:

                       -blockdev driver=raw,node-name=disk,file.driver=file,file.filename=disk.img

           Driver-specific options for "qcow2"
               This is the image format block driver for qcow2 images. It is usually stacked on top of a protocol level block driver such as
               "file".

               "file"
                   Reference to or definition of the data source block driver node (e.g. a "file" driver node)

               "backing"
                   Reference to or definition of the backing file block device (default is taken from the image file). It is allowed to pass
                   "null" here in order to disable the default backing file.

               "lazy-refcounts"
                   Whether to enable the lazy refcounts feature (on/off; default is taken from the image file)

               "cache-size"
                   The maximum total size of the L2 table and refcount block caches in bytes (default: 1048576 bytes or 8 clusters, whichever is
                   larger)

               "l2-cache-size"
                   The maximum size of the L2 table cache in bytes (default: 4/5 of the total cache size)

               "refcount-cache-size"
                   The maximum size of the refcount block cache in bytes (default: 1/5 of the total cache size)

               "cache-clean-interval"
                   Clean unused entries in the L2 and refcount caches. The interval is in seconds.  The default value is 0 and it disables this
                   feature.

               "pass-discard-request"
                   Whether discard requests to the qcow2 device should be forwarded to the data source (on/off; default: on if discard=unmap is
                   specified, off otherwise)

               "pass-discard-snapshot"
                   Whether discard requests for the data source should be issued when a snapshot operation (e.g. deleting a snapshot) frees
                   clusters in the qcow2 file (on/off; default: on)

               "pass-discard-other"
                   Whether discard requests for the data source should be issued on other occasions where a cluster gets freed (on/off; default:
                   off)

               "overlap-check"
                   Which overlap checks to perform for writes to the image (none/constant/cached/all; default: cached). For details or finer
                   granularity control refer to the QAPI documentation of "blockdev-add".

               Example 1:

                       -blockdev driver=file,node-name=my_file,filename=/tmp/disk.qcow2
                       -blockdev driver=qcow2,node-name=hda,file=my_file,overlap-check=none,cache-size=16777216

               Example 2:

                       -blockdev driver=qcow2,node-name=disk,file.driver=http,file.filename=http://example.com/image.qcow2

           Driver-specific options for other drivers
               Please refer to the QAPI documentation of the "blockdev-add" QMP command.

       -drive option[,option[,option[,...]]]
           Define a new drive. This includes creating a block driver node (the backend) as well as a guest device, and is mostly a shortcut for
           defining the corresponding -blockdev and -device options.

           -drive accepts all options that are accepted by -blockdev. In addition, it knows the following options:

           file=file
               This option defines which disk image to use with this drive. If the filename contains comma, you must double it (for instance,
               "file=my,,file" to use file "my,file").

               Special files such as iSCSI devices can be specified using protocol specific URLs. See the section for "Device URL Syntax" for more
               information.

           if=interface
               This option defines on which type on interface the drive is connected.  Available types are: ide, scsi, sd, mtd, floppy, pflash,
               virtio, none.

           bus=bus,unit=unit
               These options define where is connected the drive by defining the bus number and the unit id.

           index=index
               This option defines where is connected the drive by using an index in the list of available connectors of a given interface type.

           media=media
               This option defines the type of the media: disk or cdrom.

           cyls=c,heads=h,secs=s[,trans=t]
               Force disk physical geometry and the optional BIOS translation (trans=none or lba). These parameters are deprecated, use the
               corresponding parameters of "-device" instead.

           snapshot=snapshot
               snapshot is "on" or "off" and controls snapshot mode for the given drive (see -snapshot).

           cache=cache
               cache is "none", "writeback", "unsafe", "directsync" or "writethrough" and controls how the host cache is used to access block
               data. This is a shortcut that sets the cache.direct and cache.no-flush options (as in -blockdev), and additionally cache.writeback,
               which provides a default for the write-cache option of block guest devices (as in -device). The modes correspond to the following
               settings:

                                    ‚îÇ cache.writeback   cache.direct   cache.no-flush
                       ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
                       writeback    ‚îÇ on                off            off
                       none         ‚îÇ on                on             off
                       writethrough ‚îÇ off               off            off
                       directsync   ‚îÇ off               on             off
                       unsafe       ‚îÇ on                off            on

               The default mode is cache=writeback.

           aio=aio
               aio is "threads", or "native" and selects between pthread based disk I/O and native Linux AIO.

           format=format
               Specify which disk format will be used rather than detecting the format.  Can be used to specify format=raw to avoid interpreting
               an untrusted format header.

           serial=serial
               This option specifies the serial number to assign to the device. This parameter is deprecated, use the corresponding parameter of
               "-device" instead.

           addr=addr
               Specify the controller's PCI address (if=virtio only). This parameter is deprecated, use the corresponding parameter of "-device"
               instead.

           werror=action,rerror=action
               Specify which action to take on write and read errors. Valid actions are: "ignore" (ignore the error and try to continue), "stop"
               (pause QEMU), "report" (report the error to the guest), "enospc" (pause QEMU only if the host disk is full; report the error to the
               guest otherwise).  The default setting is werror=enospc and rerror=report.

           copy-on-read=copy-on-read
               copy-on-read is "on" or "off" and enables whether to copy read backing file sectors into the image file.

           bps=b,bps_rd=r,bps_wr=w
               Specify bandwidth throttling limits in bytes per second, either for all request types or for reads or writes only.  Small values
               can lead to timeouts or hangs inside the guest.  A safe minimum for disks is 2 MB/s.

           bps_max=bm,bps_rd_max=rm,bps_wr_max=wm
               Specify bursts in bytes per second, either for all request types or for reads or writes only.  Bursts allow the guest I/O to spike
               above the limit temporarily.

           iops=i,iops_rd=r,iops_wr=w
               Specify request rate limits in requests per second, either for all request types or for reads or writes only.

           iops_max=bm,iops_rd_max=rm,iops_wr_max=wm
               Specify bursts in requests per second, either for all request types or for reads or writes only.  Bursts allow the guest I/O to
               spike above the limit temporarily.

           iops_size=is
               Let every is bytes of a request count as a new request for iops throttling purposes.  Use this option to prevent guests from
               circumventing iops limits by sending fewer but larger requests.

           group=g
               Join a throttling quota group with given name g.  All drives that are members of the same group are accounted for together.  Use
               this option to prevent guests from circumventing throttling limits by using many small disks instead of a single larger disk.

           By default, the cache.writeback=on mode is used. It will report data writes as completed as soon as the data is present in the host
           page cache.  This is safe as long as your guest OS makes sure to correctly flush disk caches where needed. If your guest OS does not
           handle volatile disk write caches correctly and your host crashes or loses power, then the guest may experience data corruption.

           For such guests, you should consider using cache.writeback=off. This means that the host page cache will be used to read and write
           data, but write notification will be sent to the guest only after QEMU has made sure to flush each write to the disk. Be aware that
           this has a major impact on performance.

           When using the -snapshot option, unsafe caching is always used.

           Copy-on-read avoids accessing the same backing file sectors repeatedly and is useful when the backing file is over a slow network.  By
           default copy-on-read is off.

           Instead of -cdrom you can use:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=2,media=cdrom

           Instead of -hda, -hdb, -hdc, -hdd, you can use:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=0,media=disk
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=1,media=disk
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=2,media=disk
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=3,media=disk

           You can open an image using pre-opened file descriptors from an fd set:

                   qemu-system-i386
                   -add-fd fd=3,set=2,opaque="rdwr:/path/to/file"
                   -add-fd fd=4,set=2,opaque="rdonly:/path/to/file"
                   -drive file=/dev/fdset/2,index=0,media=disk

           You can connect a CDROM to the slave of ide0:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom

           If you don't specify the "file=" argument, you define an empty drive:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive if=ide,index=1,media=cdrom

           Instead of -fda, -fdb, you can use:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=0,if=floppy
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=file,index=1,if=floppy

           By default, interface is "ide" and index is automatically incremented:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=a -drive file=b"

           is interpreted like:

                   qemu-system-i386 -hda a -hdb b

       -mtdblock file
           Use file as on-board Flash memory image.

       -sd file
           Use file as SecureDigital card image.

       -pflash file
           Use file as a parallel flash image.

       -snapshot
           Write to temporary files instead of disk image files. In this case, the raw disk image you use is not written back. You can however
           force the write back by pressing C-a s.

       -fsdev
       fsdriver,id=id,path=path,[security_model=security_model][,writeout=writeout][,readonly][,socket=socket|sock_fd=sock_fd][,fmode=fmode][,dmode=dmode]
           Define a new file system device. Valid options are:

           fsdriver
               This option specifies the fs driver backend to use.  Currently "local", "handle" and "proxy" file system drivers are supported.

           id=id
               Specifies identifier for this device

           path=path
               Specifies the export path for the file system device. Files under this path will be available to the 9p client on the guest.

           security_model=security_model
               Specifies the security model to be used for this export path.  Supported security models are "passthrough", "mapped-xattr",
               "mapped-file" and "none".  In "passthrough" security model, files are stored using the same credentials as they are created on the
               guest. This requires QEMU to run as root. In "mapped-xattr" security model, some of the file attributes like uid, gid, mode bits
               and link target are stored as file attributes. For "mapped-file" these attributes are stored in the hidden .virtfs_metadata
               directory. Directories exported by this security model cannot interact with other unix tools. "none" security model is same as
               passthrough except the sever won't report failures if it fails to set file attributes like ownership. Security model is mandatory
               only for local fsdriver. Other fsdrivers (like handle, proxy) don't take security model as a parameter.

           writeout=writeout
               This is an optional argument. The only supported value is "immediate".  This means that host page cache will be used to read and
               write data but write notification will be sent to the guest only when the data has been reported as written by the storage
               subsystem.

           readonly
               Enables exporting 9p share as a readonly mount for guests. By default read-write access is given.

           socket=socket
               Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket file for communicating with virtfs-proxy-helper

           sock_fd=sock_fd
               Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket descriptor for communicating with virtfs-proxy-helper. Usually a helper like
               libvirt will create socketpair and pass one of the fds as sock_fd

           fmode=fmode
               Specifies the default mode for newly created files on the host. Works only with security models "mapped-xattr" and "mapped-file".

           dmode=dmode
               Specifies the default mode for newly created directories on the host. Works only with security models "mapped-xattr" and "mapped-
               file".

           -fsdev option is used along with -device driver "virtio-9p-pci".

       -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=id,mount_tag=mount_tag
           Options for virtio-9p-pci driver are:

           fsdev=id
               Specifies the id value specified along with -fsdev option

           mount_tag=mount_tag
               Specifies the tag name to be used by the guest to mount this export point

       -virtfs
       fsdriver[,path=path],mount_tag=mount_tag[,security_model=security_model][,writeout=writeout][,readonly][,socket=socket|sock_fd=sock_fd][,fmode=fmode][,dmode=dmode]
           The general form of a Virtual File system pass-through options are:

           fsdriver
               This option specifies the fs driver backend to use.  Currently "local", "handle" and "proxy" file system drivers are supported.

           id=id
               Specifies identifier for this device

           path=path
               Specifies the export path for the file system device. Files under this path will be available to the 9p client on the guest.

           security_model=security_model
               Specifies the security model to be used for this export path.  Supported security models are "passthrough", "mapped-xattr",
               "mapped-file" and "none".  In "passthrough" security model, files are stored using the same credentials as they are created on the
               guest. This requires QEMU to run as root. In "mapped-xattr" security model, some of the file attributes like uid, gid, mode bits
               and link target are stored as file attributes. For "mapped-file" these attributes are stored in the hidden .virtfs_metadata
               directory. Directories exported by this security model cannot interact with other unix tools. "none" security model is same as
               passthrough except the sever won't report failures if it fails to set file attributes like ownership. Security model is mandatory
               only for local fsdriver. Other fsdrivers (like handle, proxy) don't take security model as a parameter.

           writeout=writeout
               This is an optional argument. The only supported value is "immediate".  This means that host page cache will be used to read and
               write data but write notification will be sent to the guest only when the data has been reported as written by the storage
               subsystem.

           readonly
               Enables exporting 9p share as a readonly mount for guests. By default read-write access is given.

           socket=socket
               Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed socket file for communicating with virtfs-proxy-helper. Usually a helper like libvirt
               will create socketpair and pass one of the fds as sock_fd

           sock_fd
               Enables proxy filesystem driver to use passed 'sock_fd' as the socket descriptor for interfacing with virtfs-proxy-helper

           fmode=fmode
               Specifies the default mode for newly created files on the host. Works only with security models "mapped-xattr" and "mapped-file".

           dmode=dmode
               Specifies the default mode for newly created directories on the host. Works only with security models "mapped-xattr" and "mapped-
               file".

       -virtfs_synth
           Create synthetic file system image

       -iscsi
           Configure iSCSI session parameters.

       USB options

       -usb
           Enable the USB driver (if it is not used by default yet).

       -usbdevice devname
           Add the USB device devname. Note that this option is deprecated, please use "-device usb-..." instead.

           mouse
               Virtual Mouse. This will override the PS/2 mouse emulation when activated.

           tablet
               Pointer device that uses absolute coordinates (like a touchscreen). This means QEMU is able to report the mouse position without
               having to grab the mouse. Also overrides the PS/2 mouse emulation when activated.

           braille
               Braille device.  This will use BrlAPI to display the braille output on a real or fake device.

       Display options

       -display type
           Select type of display to use. This option is a replacement for the old style -sdl/-curses/... options. Valid values for type are

           sdl Display video output via SDL (usually in a separate graphics window; see the SDL documentation for other possibilities).

           curses
               Display video output via curses. For graphics device models which support a text mode, QEMU can display this output using a
               curses/ncurses interface. Nothing is displayed when the graphics device is in graphical mode or if the graphics device does not
               support a text mode. Generally only the VGA device models support text mode.

           none
               Do not display video output. The guest will still see an emulated graphics card, but its output will not be displayed to the QEMU
               user. This option differs from the -nographic option in that it only affects what is done with video output; -nographic also
               changes the destination of the serial and parallel port data.

           gtk Display video output in a GTK window. This interface provides drop-down menus and other UI elements to configure and control the VM
               during runtime.

           vnc Start a VNC server on display <arg>

       -nographic
           Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU
           monitor in a window. With this option, you can totally disable graphical output so that QEMU is a simple command line application. The
           emulated serial port is redirected on the console and muxed with the monitor (unless redirected elsewhere explicitly). Therefore, you
           can still use QEMU to debug a Linux kernel with a serial console. Use C-a h for help on switching between the console and monitor.

       -curses
           Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU
           monitor in a window. With this option, QEMU can display the VGA output when in text mode using a curses/ncurses interface. Nothing is
           displayed in graphical mode.

       -no-frame
           Do not use decorations for SDL windows and start them using the whole available screen space. This makes the using QEMU in a dedicated
           desktop workspace more convenient.

       -alt-grab
           Use Ctrl-Alt-Shift to grab mouse (instead of Ctrl-Alt). Note that this also affects the special keys (for fullscreen, monitor-mode
           switching, etc).

       -ctrl-grab
           Use Right-Ctrl to grab mouse (instead of Ctrl-Alt). Note that this also affects the special keys (for fullscreen, monitor-mode
           switching, etc).

       -no-quit
           Disable SDL window close capability.

       -sdl
           Enable SDL.

       -spice option[,option[,...]]
           Enable the spice remote desktop protocol. Valid options are

           port=<nr>
               Set the TCP port spice is listening on for plaintext channels.

           addr=<addr>
               Set the IP address spice is listening on.  Default is any address.

           ipv4
           ipv6
           unix
               Force using the specified IP version.

           password=<secret>
               Set the password you need to authenticate.

           sasl
               Require that the client use SASL to authenticate with the spice.  The exact choice of authentication method used is controlled from
               the system / user's SASL configuration file for the 'qemu' service. This is typically found in /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If running
               QEMU as an unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used to make it search alternate locations for the
               service config.  While some SASL auth methods can also provide data encryption (eg GSSAPI), it is recommended that SASL always be
               combined with the 'tls' and 'x509' settings to enable use of SSL and server certificates. This ensures a data encryption preventing
               compromise of authentication credentials.

           disable-ticketing
               Allow client connects without authentication.

           disable-copy-paste
               Disable copy paste between the client and the guest.

           disable-agent-file-xfer
               Disable spice-vdagent based file-xfer between the client and the guest.

           tls-port=<nr>
               Set the TCP port spice is listening on for encrypted channels.

           x509-dir=<dir>
               Set the x509 file directory. Expects same filenames as -vnc $display,x509=$dir

           x509-key-file=<file>
           x509-key-password=<file>
           x509-cert-file=<file>
           x509-cacert-file=<file>
           x509-dh-key-file=<file>
               The x509 file names can also be configured individually.

           tls-ciphers=<list>
               Specify which ciphers to use.

           tls-channel=[main|display|cursor|inputs|record|playback]
           plaintext-channel=[main|display|cursor|inputs|record|playback]
               Force specific channel to be used with or without TLS encryption.  The options can be specified multiple times to configure
               multiple channels.  The special name "default" can be used to set the default mode.  For channels which are not explicitly forced
               into one mode the spice client is allowed to pick tls/plaintext as he pleases.

           image-compression=[auto_glz|auto_lz|quic|glz|lz|off]
               Configure image compression (lossless).  Default is auto_glz.

           jpeg-wan-compression=[auto|never|always]
           zlib-glz-wan-compression=[auto|never|always]
               Configure wan image compression (lossy for slow links).  Default is auto.

           streaming-video=[off|all|filter]
               Configure video stream detection.  Default is off.

           agent-mouse=[on|off]
               Enable/disable passing mouse events via vdagent.  Default is on.

           playback-compression=[on|off]
               Enable/disable audio stream compression (using celt 0.5.1).  Default is on.

           seamless-migration=[on|off]
               Enable/disable spice seamless migration. Default is off.

           gl=[on|off]
               Enable/disable OpenGL context. Default is off.

           rendernode=<file>
               DRM render node for OpenGL rendering. If not specified, it will pick the first available. (Since 2.9)

       -portrait
           Rotate graphical output 90 deg left (only PXA LCD).

       -rotate deg
           Rotate graphical output some deg left (only PXA LCD).

       -vga type
           Select type of VGA card to emulate. Valid values for type are

           cirrus
               Cirrus Logic GD5446 Video card. All Windows versions starting from Windows 95 should recognize and use this graphic card. For
               optimal performances, use 16 bit color depth in the guest and the host OS.  (This card was the default before QEMU 2.2)

           std Standard VGA card with Bochs VBE extensions.  If your guest OS supports the VESA 2.0 VBE extensions (e.g. Windows XP) and if you
               want to use high resolution modes (>= 1280x1024x16) then you should use this option. (This card is the default since QEMU 2.2)

           vmware
               VMWare SVGA-II compatible adapter. Use it if you have sufficiently recent XFree86/XOrg server or Windows guest with a driver for
               this card.

           qxl QXL paravirtual graphic card.  It is VGA compatible (including VESA 2.0 VBE support).  Works best with qxl guest drivers installed
               though.  Recommended choice when using the spice protocol.

           tcx (sun4m only) Sun TCX framebuffer. This is the default framebuffer for sun4m machines and offers both 8-bit and 24-bit colour depths
               at a fixed resolution of 1024x768.

           cg3 (sun4m only) Sun cgthree framebuffer. This is a simple 8-bit framebuffer for sun4m machines available in both 1024x768 (OpenBIOS)
               and 1152x900 (OBP) resolutions aimed at people wishing to run older Solaris versions.

           virtio
               Virtio VGA card.

           none
               Disable VGA card.

       -full-screen
           Start in full screen.

       -g widthxheight[xdepth]
           Set the initial graphical resolution and depth (PPC, SPARC only).

       -vnc display[,option[,option[,...]]]
           Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it displays output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU
           monitor in a window. With this option, you can have QEMU listen on VNC display display and redirect the VGA display over the VNC
           session. It is very useful to enable the usb tablet device when using this option (option -device usb-tablet). When using the VNC
           display, you must use the -k parameter to set the keyboard layout if you are not using en-us. Valid syntax for the display is

           to=L
               With this option, QEMU will try next available VNC displays, until the number L, if the origianlly defined "-vnc display" is not
               available, e.g. port 5900+display is already used by another application. By default, to=0.

           host:d
               TCP connections will only be allowed from host on display d.  By convention the TCP port is 5900+d. Optionally, host can be omitted
               in which case the server will accept connections from any host.

           unix:path
               Connections will be allowed over UNIX domain sockets where path is the location of a unix socket to listen for connections on.

           none
               VNC is initialized but not started. The monitor "change" command can be used to later start the VNC server.

           Following the display value there may be one or more option flags separated by commas. Valid options are

           reverse
               Connect to a listening VNC client via a "reverse" connection. The client is specified by the display. For reverse network
               connections (host:d,"reverse"), the d argument is a TCP port number, not a display number.

           websocket
               Opens an additional TCP listening port dedicated to VNC Websocket connections.  If a bare websocket option is given, the Websocket
               port is 5700+display. An alternative port can be specified with the syntax "websocket"=port.

               If host is specified connections will only be allowed from this host.  It is possible to control the websocket listen address
               independently, using the syntax "websocket"=host:port.

               If no TLS credentials are provided, the websocket connection runs in unencrypted mode. If TLS credentials are provided, the
               websocket connection requires encrypted client connections.

           password
               Require that password based authentication is used for client connections.

               The password must be set separately using the "set_password" command in the pcsys_monitor. The syntax to change your password is:
               "set_password <protocol> <password>" where <protocol> could be either "vnc" or "spice".

               If you would like to change <protocol> password expiration, you should use "expire_password <protocol> <expiration-time>" where
               expiration time could be one of the following options: now, never, +seconds or UNIX time of expiration, e.g. +60 to make password
               expire in 60 seconds, or 1335196800 to make password expire on "Mon Apr 23 12:00:00 EDT 2012" (UNIX time for this date and time).

               You can also use keywords "now" or "never" for the expiration time to allow <protocol> password to expire immediately or never
               expire.

           tls-creds=ID
               Provides the ID of a set of TLS credentials to use to secure the VNC server. They will apply to both the normal VNC server socket
               and the websocket socket (if enabled). Setting TLS credentials will cause the VNC server socket to enable the VeNCrypt auth
               mechanism.  The credentials should have been previously created using the -object tls-creds argument.

               The tls-creds parameter obsoletes the tls, x509, and x509verify options, and as such it is not permitted to set both new and old
               type options at the same time.

           tls Require that client use TLS when communicating with the VNC server. This uses anonymous TLS credentials so is susceptible to a man-
               in-the-middle attack. It is recommended that this option be combined with either the x509 or x509verify options.

               This option is now deprecated in favor of using the tls-creds argument.

           x509=/path/to/certificate/dir
               Valid if tls is specified. Require that x509 credentials are used for negotiating the TLS session. The server will send its x509
               certificate to the client. It is recommended that a password be set on the VNC server to provide authentication of the client when
               this is used. The path following this option specifies where the x509 certificates are to be loaded from.  See the vnc_security
               section for details on generating certificates.

               This option is now deprecated in favour of using the tls-creds argument.

           x509verify=/path/to/certificate/dir
               Valid if tls is specified. Require that x509 credentials are used for negotiating the TLS session. The server will send its x509
               certificate to the client, and request that the client send its own x509 certificate.  The server will validate the client's
               certificate against the CA certificate, and reject clients when validation fails. If the certificate authority is trusted, this is
               a sufficient authentication mechanism. You may still wish to set a password on the VNC server as a second authentication layer. The
               path following this option specifies where the x509 certificates are to be loaded from. See the vnc_security section for details on
               generating certificates.

               This option is now deprecated in favour of using the tls-creds argument.

           sasl
               Require that the client use SASL to authenticate with the VNC server.  The exact choice of authentication method used is controlled
               from the system / user's SASL configuration file for the 'qemu' service. This is typically found in /etc/sasl2/qemu.conf. If
               running QEMU as an unprivileged user, an environment variable SASL_CONF_PATH can be used to make it search alternate locations for
               the service config.  While some SASL auth methods can also provide data encryption (eg GSSAPI), it is recommended that SASL always
               be combined with the 'tls' and 'x509' settings to enable use of SSL and server certificates. This ensures a data encryption
               preventing compromise of authentication credentials. See the vnc_security section for details on using SASL authentication.

           acl Turn on access control lists for checking of the x509 client certificate and SASL party. For x509 certs, the ACL check is made
               against the certificate's distinguished name. This is something that looks like "C=GB,O=ACME,L=Boston,CN=bob". For SASL party, the
               ACL check is made against the username, which depending on the SASL plugin, may include a realm component, eg "bob" or
               "bob@EXAMPLE.COM".  When the acl flag is set, the initial access list will be empty, with a "deny" policy. Thus no one will be
               allowed to use the VNC server until the ACLs have been loaded. This can be achieved using the "acl" monitor command.

           lossy
               Enable lossy compression methods (gradient, JPEG, ...). If this option is set, VNC client may receive lossy framebuffer updates
               depending on its encoding settings. Enabling this option can save a lot of bandwidth at the expense of quality.

           non-adaptive
               Disable adaptive encodings. Adaptive encodings are enabled by default.  An adaptive encoding will try to detect frequently updated
               screen regions, and send updates in these regions using a lossy encoding (like JPEG).  This can be really helpful to save bandwidth
               when playing videos. Disabling adaptive encodings restores the original static behavior of encodings like Tight.

           share=[allow-exclusive|force-shared|ignore]
               Set display sharing policy.  'allow-exclusive' allows clients to ask for exclusive access.  As suggested by the rfb spec this is
               implemented by dropping other connections.  Connecting multiple clients in parallel requires all clients asking for a shared
               session (vncviewer: -shared switch).  This is the default.  'force-shared' disables exclusive client access.  Useful for shared
               desktop sessions, where you don't want someone forgetting specify -shared disconnect everybody else.  'ignore' completely ignores
               the shared flag and allows everybody connect unconditionally.  Doesn't conform to the rfb spec but is traditional QEMU behavior.

           key-delay-ms
               Set keyboard delay, for key down and key up events, in milliseconds.  Default is 10.  Keyboards are low-bandwidth devices, so this
               slowdown can help the device and guest to keep up and not lose events in case events are arriving in bulk.  Possible causes for the
               latter are flaky network connections, or scripts for automated testing.

       i386 target only

       -win2k-hack
           Use it when installing Windows 2000 to avoid a disk full bug. After Windows 2000 is installed, you no longer need this option (this
           option slows down the IDE transfers).

       -no-fd-bootchk
           Disable boot signature checking for floppy disks in BIOS. May be needed to boot from old floppy disks.

       -no-acpi
           Disable ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) support. Use it if your guest OS complains about ACPI problems (PC target
           machine only).

       -no-hpet
           Disable HPET support.

       -acpitable [sig=str][,rev=n][,oem_id=str][,oem_table_id=str][,oem_rev=n]
       [,asl_compiler_id=str][,asl_compiler_rev=n][,data=file1[:file2]...]
           Add ACPI table with specified header fields and context from specified files.  For file=, take whole ACPI table from the specified
           files, including all ACPI headers (possible overridden by other options).  For data=, only data portion of the table is used, all
           header information is specified in the command line.  If a SLIC table is supplied to QEMU, then the SLIC's oem_id and oem_table_id
           fields will override the same in the RSDT and the FADT (a.k.a. FACP), in order to ensure the field matches required by the Microsoft
           SLIC spec and the ACPI spec.

       -smbios file=binary
           Load SMBIOS entry from binary file.

       -smbios type=0[,vendor=str][,version=str][,date=str][,release=%d.%d][,uefi=on|off]
           Specify SMBIOS type 0 fields

       -smbios type=1[,manufacturer=str][,product=str][,version=str][,serial=str][,uuid=uuid][,sku=str][,family=str]
           Specify SMBIOS type 1 fields

       -smbios type=2[,manufacturer=str][,product=str][,version=str][,serial=str][,asset=str][,location=str][,family=str]
           Specify SMBIOS type 2 fields

       -smbios type=3[,manufacturer=str][,version=str][,serial=str][,asset=str][,sku=str]
           Specify SMBIOS type 3 fields

       -smbios type=4[,sock_pfx=str][,manufacturer=str][,version=str][,serial=str][,asset=str][,part=str]
           Specify SMBIOS type 4 fields

       -smbios type=17[,loc_pfx=str][,bank=str][,manufacturer=str][,serial=str][,asset=str][,part=str][,speed=%d]
           Specify SMBIOS type 17 fields

       Network options

       -nic [tap|bridge|user|l2tpv3|vde|netmap|vhost-user|socket][,...][,mac=macaddr][,model=mn]
           This option is a shortcut for configuring both the on-board (default) guest NIC hardware and the host network backend in one go. The
           host backend options are the same as with the corresponding -netdev options below.  The guest NIC model can be set with
           model=modelname.  Use model=help to list the available device types.  The hardware MAC address can be set with mac=macaddr.

           The following two example do exactly the same, to show how -nic can be used to shorten the command line length (note that the e1000 is
           the default on i386, so the model=e1000 parameter could even be omitted here, too):

                   qemu-system-i386 -netdev user,id=n1,ipv6=off -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=52:54:98:76:54:32
                   qemu-system-i386 -nic user,ipv6=off,model=e1000,mac=52:54:98:76:54:32

       -nic none
           Indicate that no network devices should be configured. It is used to override the default configuration (default NIC with "user" host
           network backend) which is activated if no other networking options are provided.

       -netdev user,id=id[,option][,option][,...]
           Configure user mode host network backend which requires no administrator privilege to run. Valid options are:

           id=id
               Assign symbolic name for use in monitor commands.

           ipv4=on|off and ipv6=on|off
               Specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must be enabled. If neither is specified both protocols are enabled.

           net=addr[/mask]
               Set IP network address the guest will see. Optionally specify the netmask, either in the form a.b.c.d or as number of valid top-
               most bits. Default is 10.0.2.0/24.

           host=addr
               Specify the guest-visible address of the host. Default is the 2nd IP in the guest network, i.e. x.x.x.2.

           ipv6-net=addr[/int]
               Set IPv6 network address the guest will see (default is fec0::/64). The network prefix is given in the usual hexadecimal IPv6
               address notation. The prefix size is optional, and is given as the number of valid top-most bits (default is 64).

           ipv6-host=addr
               Specify the guest-visible IPv6 address of the host. Default is the 2nd IPv6 in the guest network, i.e. xxxx::2.

           restrict=on|off
               If this option is enabled, the guest will be isolated, i.e. it will not be able to contact the host and no guest IP packets will be
               routed over the host to the outside. This option does not affect any explicitly set forwarding rules.

           hostname=name
               Specifies the client hostname reported by the built-in DHCP server.

           dhcpstart=addr
               Specify the first of the 16 IPs the built-in DHCP server can assign. Default is the 15th to 31st IP in the guest network, i.e.
               x.x.x.15 to x.x.x.31.

           dns=addr
               Specify the guest-visible address of the virtual nameserver. The address must be different from the host address. Default is the
               3rd IP in the guest network, i.e. x.x.x.3.

           ipv6-dns=addr
               Specify the guest-visible address of the IPv6 virtual nameserver. The address must be different from the host address. Default is
               the 3rd IP in the guest network, i.e. xxxx::3.

           dnssearch=domain
               Provides an entry for the domain-search list sent by the built-in DHCP server. More than one domain suffix can be transmitted by
               specifying this option multiple times. If supported, this will cause the guest to automatically try to append the given domain
               suffix(es) in case a domain name can not be resolved.

               Example:

                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,dnssearch=mgmt.example.org,dnssearch=example.org

           tftp=dir
               When using the user mode network stack, activate a built-in TFTP server. The files in dir will be exposed as the root of a TFTP
               server.  The TFTP client on the guest must be configured in binary mode (use the command "bin" of the Unix TFTP client).

           bootfile=file
               When using the user mode network stack, broadcast file as the BOOTP filename. In conjunction with tftp, this can be used to network
               boot a guest from a local directory.

               Example (using pxelinux):

                       qemu-system-i386 -hda linux.img -boot n -device e1000,netdev=n1 \
                       -netdev user,id=n1,tftp=/path/to/tftp/files,bootfile=/pxelinux.0

           smb=dir[,smbserver=addr]
               When using the user mode network stack, activate a built-in SMB server so that Windows OSes can access to the host files in dir
               transparently. The IP address of the SMB server can be set to addr. By default the 4th IP in the guest network is used, i.e.
               x.x.x.4.

               In the guest Windows OS, the line:

                       10.0.2.4 smbserver

               must be added in the file C:\WINDOWS\LMHOSTS (for windows 9x/Me) or C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\LMHOSTS (Windows NT/2000).

               Then dir can be accessed in \\smbserver\qemu.

               Note that a SAMBA server must be installed on the host OS.

           hostfwd=[tcp|udp]:[hostaddr]:hostport-[guestaddr]:guestport
               Redirect incoming TCP or UDP connections to the host port hostport to the guest IP address guestaddr on guest port guestport. If
               guestaddr is not specified, its value is x.x.x.15 (default first address given by the built-in DHCP server). By specifying
               hostaddr, the rule can be bound to a specific host interface. If no connection type is set, TCP is used. This option can be given
               multiple times.

               For example, to redirect host X11 connection from screen 1 to guest screen 0, use the following:

                       # on the host
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:6001-:6000
                       # this host xterm should open in the guest X11 server
                       xterm -display :1

               To redirect telnet connections from host port 5555 to telnet port on the guest, use the following:

                       # on the host
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,hostfwd=tcp::5555-:23
                       telnet localhost 5555

               Then when you use on the host "telnet localhost 5555", you connect to the guest telnet server.

           guestfwd=[tcp]:server:port-dev
           guestfwd=[tcp]:server:port-cmd:command
               Forward guest TCP connections to the IP address server on port port to the character device dev or to a program executed by
               cmd:command which gets spawned for each connection. This option can be given multiple times.

               You can either use a chardev directly and have that one used throughout QEMU's lifetime, like in the following example:

                       # open 10.10.1.1:4321 on bootup, connect 10.0.2.100:1234 to it whenever
                       # the guest accesses it
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic user,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:1234-tcp:10.10.1.1:4321

               Or you can execute a command on every TCP connection established by the guest, so that QEMU behaves similar to an inetd process for
               that virtual server:

                       # call "netcat 10.10.1.1 4321" on every TCP connection to 10.0.2.100:1234
                       # and connect the TCP stream to its stdin/stdout
                       qemu-system-i386 -nic  'user,id=n1,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.100:1234-cmd:netcat 10.10.1.1 4321'

           Note: Legacy stand-alone options -tftp, -bootp, -smb and -redir are still processed and applied to -net user. Mixing them with the new
           configuration syntax gives undefined results. Their use for new applications is discouraged as they will be removed from future
           versions.

       -netdev tap,id=id[,fd=h][,ifname=name][,script=file][,downscript=dfile][,br=bridge][,helper=helper]
           Configure a host TAP network backend with ID id.

           Use the network script file to configure it and the network script dfile to deconfigure it. If name is not provided, the OS
           automatically provides one. The default network configure script is /etc/qemu-ifup and the default network deconfigure script is
           /etc/qemu-ifdown. Use script=no or downscript=no to disable script execution.

           If running QEMU as an unprivileged user, use the network helper helper to configure the TAP interface and attach it to the bridge.  The
           default network helper executable is /path/to/qemu-bridge-helper and the default bridge device is br0.

           fd=h can be used to specify the handle of an already opened host TAP interface.

           Examples:

                   #launch a QEMU instance with the default network script
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -nic tap

                   #launch a QEMU instance with two NICs, each one connected
                   #to a TAP device
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -netdev tap,id=nd0,ifname=tap0 -device e1000,netdev=nd0 \
                   -netdev tap,id=nd1,ifname=tap1 -device rtl8139,netdev=nd1

                   #launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to
                   #connect a TAP device to bridge br0
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=n1 \
                   -netdev tap,id=n1,"helper=/path/to/qemu-bridge-helper"

       -netdev bridge,id=id[,br=bridge][,helper=helper]
           Connect a host TAP network interface to a host bridge device.

           Use the network helper helper to configure the TAP interface and attach it to the bridge. The default network helper executable is
           /path/to/qemu-bridge-helper and the default bridge device is br0.

           Examples:

                   #launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to
                   #connect a TAP device to bridge br0
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -netdev bridge,id=n1 -device virtio-net,netdev=n1

                   #launch a QEMU instance with the default network helper to
                   #connect a TAP device to bridge qemubr0
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -netdev bridge,br=qemubr0,id=n1 -device virtio-net,netdev=n1

       -netdev socket,id=id[,fd=h][,listen=[host]:port][,connect=host:port]
           This host network backend can be used to connect the guest's network to another QEMU virtual machine using a TCP socket connection. If
           listen is specified, QEMU waits for incoming connections on port (host is optional). connect is used to connect to another QEMU
           instance using the listen option. fd=h specifies an already opened TCP socket.

           Example:

                   # launch a first QEMU instance
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n1,listen=:1234
                   # connect the network of this instance to the network of the first instance
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n2,mac=52:54:00:12:34:57 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n2,connect=127.0.0.1:1234

       -netdev socket,id=id[,fd=h][,mcast=maddr:port[,localaddr=addr]]
           Configure a socket host network backend to share the guest's network traffic with another QEMU virtual machines using a UDP multicast
           socket, effectively making a bus for every QEMU with same multicast address maddr and port.  NOTES:

           1.  Several QEMU can be running on different hosts and share same bus (assuming correct multicast setup for these hosts).

           2.  mcast support is compatible with User Mode Linux (argument ethN=mcast), see <http://user-mode-linux.sf.net>.

           3.  Use fd=h to specify an already opened UDP multicast socket.

           Example:

                   # launch one QEMU instance
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n1,mcast=230.0.0.1:1234
                   # launch another QEMU instance on same "bus"
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n2,mac=52:54:00:12:34:57 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n2,mcast=230.0.0.1:1234
                   # launch yet another QEMU instance on same "bus"
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n3,macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:58 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n3,mcast=230.0.0.1:1234

           Example (User Mode Linux compat.):

                   # launch QEMU instance (note mcast address selected is UML's default)
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n1,mcast=239.192.168.1:1102
                   # launch UML
                   /path/to/linux ubd0=/path/to/root_fs eth0=mcast

           Example (send packets from host's 1.2.3.4):

                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img \
                   -device e1000,netdev=n1,mac=52:54:00:12:34:56 \
                   -netdev socket,id=n1,mcast=239.192.168.1:1102,localaddr=1.2.3.4

       -netdev
       l2tpv3,id=id,src=srcaddr,dst=dstaddr[,srcport=srcport][,dstport=dstport],txsession=txsession[,rxsession=rxsession][,ipv6][,udp][,cookie64][,counter][,pincounter][,txcookie=txcookie][,rxcookie=rxcookie][,offset=offset]
           Configure a L2TPv3 pseudowire host network backend. L2TPv3 (RFC3391) is a popular protocol to transport Ethernet (and other Layer 2)
           data frames between two systems. It is present in routers, firewalls and the Linux kernel (from version 3.3 onwards).

           This transport allows a VM to communicate to another VM, router or firewall directly.

           src=srcaddr
               source address (mandatory)

           dst=dstaddr
               destination address (mandatory)

           udp select udp encapsulation (default is ip).

           srcport=srcport
               source udp port.

           dstport=dstport
               destination udp port.

           ipv6
               force v6, otherwise defaults to v4.

           rxcookie=rxcookie
           txcookie=txcookie
               Cookies are a weak form of security in the l2tpv3 specification.  Their function is mostly to prevent misconfiguration. By default
               they are 32 bit.

           cookie64
               Set cookie size to 64 bit instead of the default 32

           counter=off
               Force a 'cut-down' L2TPv3 with no counter as in draft-mkonstan-l2tpext-keyed-ipv6-tunnel-00

           pincounter=on
               Work around broken counter handling in peer. This may also help on networks which have packet reorder.

           offset=offset
               Add an extra offset between header and data

           For example, to attach a VM running on host 4.3.2.1 via L2TPv3 to the bridge br-lan on the remote Linux host 1.2.3.4:

                   # Setup tunnel on linux host using raw ip as encapsulation
                   # on 1.2.3.4
                   ip l2tp add tunnel remote 4.3.2.1 local 1.2.3.4 tunnel_id 1 peer_tunnel_id 1 \
                   encap udp udp_sport 16384 udp_dport 16384
                   ip l2tp add session tunnel_id 1 name vmtunnel0 session_id \
                   0xFFFFFFFF peer_session_id 0xFFFFFFFF
                   ifconfig vmtunnel0 mtu 1500
                   ifconfig vmtunnel0 up
                   brctl addif br-lan vmtunnel0

                   # on 4.3.2.1
                   # launch QEMU instance - if your network has reorder or is very lossy add ,pincounter

                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -device e1000,netdev=n1 \
                   -netdev l2tpv3,id=n1,src=4.2.3.1,dst=1.2.3.4,udp,srcport=16384,dstport=16384,rxsession=0xffffffff,txsession=0xffffffff,counter

       -netdev vde,id=id[,sock=socketpath][,port=n][,group=groupname][,mode=octalmode]
           Configure VDE backend to connect to PORT n of a vde switch running on host and listening for incoming connections on socketpath. Use
           GROUP groupname and MODE octalmode to change default ownership and permissions for communication port. This option is only available if
           QEMU has been compiled with vde support enabled.

           Example:

                   # launch vde switch
                   vde_switch -F -sock /tmp/myswitch
                   # launch QEMU instance
                   qemu-system-i386 linux.img -nic vde,sock=/tmp/myswitch

       -netdev vhost-user,chardev=id[,vhostforce=on|off][,queues=n]
           Establish a vhost-user netdev, backed by a chardev id. The chardev should be a unix domain socket backed one. The vhost-user uses a
           specifically defined protocol to pass vhost ioctl replacement messages to an application on the other end of the socket. On non-MSIX
           guests, the feature can be forced with vhostforce. Use 'queues=n' to specify the number of queues to be created for multiqueue vhost-
           user.

           Example:

                   qemu -m 512 -object memory-backend-file,id=mem,size=512M,mem-path=/hugetlbfs,share=on \
                   -numa node,memdev=mem \
                   -chardev socket,id=chr0,path=/path/to/socket \
                   -netdev type=vhost-user,id=net0,chardev=chr0 \
                   -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=net0

       -netdev hubport,id=id,hubid=hubid[,netdev=nd]
           Create a hub port on the emulated hub with ID hubid.

           The hubport netdev lets you connect a NIC to a QEMU emulated hub instead of a single netdev. "-net" and "-device" with the parameter
           vlan (deprecated), or "-nic hubport" can also be used to connect a network device or a NIC to a hub. Alternatively, you can also
           connect the hubport to another netdev with ID nd by using the netdev=nd option.

       -net nic[,vlan=n][,netdev=nd][,macaddr=mac][,model=type] [,name=name][,addr=addr][,vectors=v]
           Legacy option to configure or create an on-board (or machine default) Network Interface Card(NIC) and connect it either to the emulated
           hub port ("vlan") with number n (n = 0 is the default), or to the netdev nd.  The NIC is an e1000 by default on the PC target.
           Optionally, the MAC address can be changed to mac, the device address set to addr (PCI cards only), and a name can be assigned for use
           in monitor commands.  Optionally, for PCI cards, you can specify the number v of MSI-X vectors that the card should have; this option
           currently only affects virtio cards; set v = 0 to disable MSI-X. If no -net option is specified, a single NIC is created.  QEMU can
           emulate several different models of network card.  Use "-net nic,model=help" for a list of available devices for your target.

       -net user|tap|bridge|socket|l2tpv3|vde[,...][,vlan=n][,name=name]
           Configure a host network backend (with the options corresponding to the same -netdev option) and connect it to the emulated hub
           ("vlan") with the number n (default is number 0). Use name to specify the name of the hub port.

       Character device options

       The general form of a character device option is:

       -chardev backend,id=id[,mux=on|off][,options]
           Backend is one of: null, socket, udp, msmouse, vc, ringbuf, file, pipe, console, serial, pty, stdio, braille, tty, parallel, parport,
           spicevmc, spiceport.  The specific backend will determine the applicable options.

           Use "-chardev help" to print all available chardev backend types.

           All devices must have an id, which can be any string up to 127 characters long.  It is used to uniquely identify this device in other
           command line directives.

           A character device may be used in multiplexing mode by multiple front-ends.  Specify mux=on to enable this mode.  A multiplexer is a
           "1:N" device, and here the "1" end is your specified chardev backend, and the "N" end is the various parts of QEMU that can talk to a
           chardev.  If you create a chardev with id=myid and mux=on, QEMU will create a multiplexer with your specified ID, and you can then
           configure multiple front ends to use that chardev ID for their input/output. Up to four different front ends can be connected to a
           single multiplexed chardev. (Without multiplexing enabled, a chardev can only be used by a single front end.)  For instance you could
           use this to allow a single stdio chardev to be used by two serial ports and the QEMU monitor:

                   -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
                   -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
                   -serial chardev:char0 \
                   -serial chardev:char0

           You can have more than one multiplexer in a system configuration; for instance you could have a TCP port multiplexed between UART 0 and
           UART 1, and stdio multiplexed between the QEMU monitor and a parallel port:

                   -chardev stdio,mux=on,id=char0 \
                   -mon chardev=char0,mode=readline \
                   -parallel chardev:char0 \
                   -chardev tcp,...,mux=on,id=char1 \
                   -serial chardev:char1 \
                   -serial chardev:char1

           When you're using a multiplexed character device, some escape sequences are interpreted in the input.

           Note that some other command line options may implicitly create multiplexed character backends; for instance -serial mon:stdio creates
           a multiplexed stdio backend connected to the serial port and the QEMU monitor, and -nographic also multiplexes the console and the
           monitor to stdio.

           There is currently no support for multiplexing in the other direction (where a single QEMU front end takes input and output from
           multiple chardevs).

           Every backend supports the logfile option, which supplies the path to a file to record all data transmitted via the backend. The
           logappend option controls whether the log file will be truncated or appended to when opened.

       The available backends are:

       -chardev null,id=id
           A void device. This device will not emit any data, and will drop any data it receives. The null backend does not take any options.

       -chardev socket,id=id[,TCP options or unix options][,server][,nowait][,telnet][,reconnect=seconds][,tls-creds=id]
           Create a two-way stream socket, which can be either a TCP or a unix socket. A unix socket will be created if path is specified.
           Behaviour is undefined if TCP options are specified for a unix socket.

           server specifies that the socket shall be a listening socket.

           nowait specifies that QEMU should not block waiting for a client to connect to a listening socket.

           telnet specifies that traffic on the socket should interpret telnet escape sequences.

           reconnect sets the timeout for reconnecting on non-server sockets when the remote end goes away.  qemu will delay this many seconds and
           then attempt to reconnect.  Zero disables reconnecting, and is the default.

           tls-creds requests enablement of the TLS protocol for encryption, and specifies the id of the TLS credentials to use for the handshake.
           The credentials must be previously created with the -object tls-creds argument.

           TCP and unix socket options are given below:

           TCP options: port=port[,host=host][,to=to][,ipv4][,ipv6][,nodelay]
               host for a listening socket specifies the local address to be bound.  For a connecting socket species the remote host to connect
               to. host is optional for listening sockets. If not specified it defaults to 0.0.0.0.

               port for a listening socket specifies the local port to be bound. For a connecting socket specifies the port on the remote host to
               connect to.  port can be given as either a port number or a service name.  port is required.

               to is only relevant to listening sockets. If it is specified, and port cannot be bound, QEMU will attempt to bind to subsequent
               ports up to and including to until it succeeds. to must be specified as a port number.

               ipv4 and ipv6 specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must be used.  If neither is specified the socket may use either protocol.

               nodelay disables the Nagle algorithm.

           unix options: path=path
               path specifies the local path of the unix socket. path is required.

       -chardev udp,id=id[,host=host],port=port[,localaddr=localaddr][,localport=localport][,ipv4][,ipv6]
           Sends all traffic from the guest to a remote host over UDP.

           host specifies the remote host to connect to. If not specified it defaults to "localhost".

           port specifies the port on the remote host to connect to. port is required.

           localaddr specifies the local address to bind to. If not specified it defaults to 0.0.0.0.

           localport specifies the local port to bind to. If not specified any available local port will be used.

           ipv4 and ipv6 specify that either IPv4 or IPv6 must be used.  If neither is specified the device may use either protocol.

       -chardev msmouse,id=id
           Forward QEMU's emulated msmouse events to the guest. msmouse does not take any options.

       -chardev vc,id=id[[,width=width][,height=height]][[,cols=cols][,rows=rows]]
           Connect to a QEMU text console. vc may optionally be given a specific size.

           width and height specify the width and height respectively of the console, in pixels.

           cols and rows specify that the console be sized to fit a text console with the given dimensions.

       -chardev ringbuf,id=id[,size=size]
           Create a ring buffer with fixed size size.  size must be a power of two and defaults to "64K".

       -chardev file,id=id,path=path
           Log all traffic received from the guest to a file.

           path specifies the path of the file to be opened. This file will be created if it does not already exist, and overwritten if it does.
           path is required.

       -chardev pipe,id=id,path=path
           Create a two-way connection to the guest. The behaviour differs slightly between Windows hosts and other hosts:

           On Windows, a single duplex pipe will be created at \\.pipe\path.

           On other hosts, 2 pipes will be created called path.in and path.out. Data written to path.in will be received by the guest. Data
           written by the guest can be read from path.out. QEMU will not create these fifos, and requires them to be present.

           path forms part of the pipe path as described above. path is required.

       -chardev console,id=id
           Send traffic from the guest to QEMU's standard output. console does not take any options.

           console is only available on Windows hosts.

       -chardev serial,id=id,path=path
           Send traffic from the guest to a serial device on the host.

           On Unix hosts serial will actually accept any tty device, not only serial lines.

           path specifies the name of the serial device to open.

       -chardev pty,id=id
           Create a new pseudo-terminal on the host and connect to it. pty does not take any options.

           pty is not available on Windows hosts.

       -chardev stdio,id=id[,signal=on|off]
           Connect to standard input and standard output of the QEMU process.

           signal controls if signals are enabled on the terminal, that includes exiting QEMU with the key sequence Control-c. This option is
           enabled by default, use signal=off to disable it.

       -chardev braille,id=id
           Connect to a local BrlAPI server. braille does not take any options.

       -chardev tty,id=id,path=path
           tty is only available on Linux, Sun, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFlyBSD hosts.  It is an alias for serial.

           path specifies the path to the tty. path is required.

       -chardev parallel,id=id,path=path
       -chardev parport,id=id,path=path
           parallel is only available on Linux, FreeBSD and DragonFlyBSD hosts.

           Connect to a local parallel port.

           path specifies the path to the parallel port device. path is required.

       -chardev spicevmc,id=id,debug=debug,name=name
           spicevmc is only available when spice support is built in.

           debug debug level for spicevmc

           name name of spice channel to connect to

           Connect to a spice virtual machine channel, such as vdiport.

       -chardev spiceport,id=id,debug=debug,name=name
           spiceport is only available when spice support is built in.

           debug debug level for spicevmc

           name name of spice port to connect to

           Connect to a spice port, allowing a Spice client to handle the traffic identified by a name (preferably a fqdn).

       Bluetooth(R) options

       -bt hci[...]
           Defines the function of the corresponding Bluetooth HCI.  -bt options are matched with the HCIs present in the chosen machine type.
           For example when emulating a machine with only one HCI built into it, only the first "-bt hci[...]" option is valid and defines the
           HCI's logic.  The Transport Layer is decided by the machine type.  Currently the machines "n800" and "n810" have one HCI and all other
           machines have none.

           The following three types are recognized:

           -bt hci,null
               (default) The corresponding Bluetooth HCI assumes no internal logic and will not respond to any HCI commands or emit events.

           -bt hci,host[:id]
               ("bluez" only) The corresponding HCI passes commands / events to / from the physical HCI identified by the name id (default:
               "hci0") on the computer running QEMU.  Only available on "bluez" capable systems like Linux.

           -bt hci[,vlan=n]
               Add a virtual, standard HCI that will participate in the Bluetooth scatternet n (default 0).  Similarly to -net VLANs, devices
               inside a bluetooth network n can only communicate with other devices in the same network (scatternet).

       -bt vhci[,vlan=n]
           (Linux-host only) Create a HCI in scatternet n (default 0) attached to the host bluetooth stack instead of to the emulated target.
           This allows the host and target machines to participate in a common scatternet and communicate.  Requires the Linux "vhci" driver
           installed.  Can be used as following:

                   qemu-system-i386 [...OPTIONS...] -bt hci,vlan=5 -bt vhci,vlan=5

       -bt device:dev[,vlan=n]
           Emulate a bluetooth device dev and place it in network n (default 0).  QEMU can only emulate one type of bluetooth devices currently:

           keyboard
               Virtual wireless keyboard implementing the HIDP bluetooth profile.

       TPM device options

       The general form of a TPM device option is:

       -tpmdev backend,id=id[,options]
           The specific backend type will determine the applicable options.  The "-tpmdev" option creates the TPM backend and requires a "-device"
           option that specifies the TPM frontend interface model.

           Use "-tpmdev help" to print all available TPM backend types.

       The available backends are:

       -tpmdev passthrough,id=id,path=path,cancel-path=cancel-path
           (Linux-host only) Enable access to the host's TPM using the passthrough driver.

           path specifies the path to the host's TPM device, i.e., on a Linux host this would be "/dev/tpm0".  path is optional and by default
           "/dev/tpm0" is used.

           cancel-path specifies the path to the host TPM device's sysfs entry allowing for cancellation of an ongoing TPM command.  cancel-path
           is optional and by default QEMU will search for the sysfs entry to use.

           Some notes about using the host's TPM with the passthrough driver:

           The TPM device accessed by the passthrough driver must not be used by any other application on the host.

           Since the host's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) has already initialized the TPM, the VM's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) will not be able to initialize the
           TPM again and may therefore not show a TPM-specific menu that would otherwise allow the user to configure the TPM, e.g., allow the user
           to enable/disable or activate/deactivate the TPM.  Further, if TPM ownership is released from within a VM then the host's TPM will get
           disabled and deactivated. To enable and activate the TPM again afterwards, the host has to be rebooted and the user is required to
           enter the firmware's menu to enable and activate the TPM.  If the TPM is left disabled and/or deactivated most TPM commands will fail.

           To create a passthrough TPM use the following two options:

                   -tpmdev passthrough,id=tpm0 -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0

           Note that the "-tpmdev" id is "tpm0" and is referenced by "tpmdev=tpm0" in the device option.

       -tpmdev emulator,id=id,chardev=dev
           (Linux-host only) Enable access to a TPM emulator using Unix domain socket based chardev backend.

           chardev specifies the unique ID of a character device backend that provides connection to the software TPM server.

           To create a TPM emulator backend device with chardev socket backend:

                   -chardev socket,id=chrtpm,path=/tmp/swtpm-sock -tpmdev emulator,id=tpm0,chardev=chrtpm -device tpm-tis,tpmdev=tpm0

       Linux/Multiboot boot specific

       When using these options, you can use a given Linux or Multiboot kernel without installing it in the disk image. It can be useful for
       easier testing of various kernels.

       -kernel bzImage
           Use bzImage as kernel image. The kernel can be either a Linux kernel or in multiboot format.

       -append cmdline
           Use cmdline as kernel command line

       -initrd file
           Use file as initial ram disk.

       -initrd "file1 arg=foo,file2"
           This syntax is only available with multiboot.

           Use file1 and file2 as modules and pass arg=foo as parameter to the first module.

       -dtb file
           Use file as a device tree binary (dtb) image and pass it to the kernel on boot.

       Debug/Expert options

       -fw_cfg [name=]name,file=file
           Add named fw_cfg entry with contents from file file.

       -fw_cfg [name=]name,string=str
           Add named fw_cfg entry with contents from string str.

           The terminating NUL character of the contents of str will not be included as part of the fw_cfg item data. To insert contents with
           embedded NUL characters, you have to use the file parameter.

           The fw_cfg entries are passed by QEMU through to the guest.

           Example:

                   -fw_cfg name=opt/com.mycompany/blob,file=./my_blob.bin

           creates an fw_cfg entry named opt/com.mycompany/blob with contents from ./my_blob.bin.

       -serial dev
           Redirect the virtual serial port to host character device dev. The default device is "vc" in graphical mode and "stdio" in non
           graphical mode.

           This option can be used several times to simulate up to 4 serial ports.

           Use "-serial none" to disable all serial ports.

           Available character devices are:

           vc[:WxH]
               Virtual console. Optionally, a width and height can be given in pixel with

                       vc:800x600

               It is also possible to specify width or height in characters:

                       vc:80Cx24C

           pty [Linux only] Pseudo TTY (a new PTY is automatically allocated)

           none
               No device is allocated.

           null
               void device

           chardev:id
               Use a named character device defined with the "-chardev" option.

           /dev/XXX
               [Linux only] Use host tty, e.g. /dev/ttyS0. The host serial port parameters are set according to the emulated ones.

           /dev/parportN
               [Linux only, parallel port only] Use host parallel port N. Currently SPP and EPP parallel port features can be used.

           file:filename
               Write output to filename. No character can be read.

           stdio
               [Unix only] standard input/output

           pipe:filename
               name pipe filename

           COMn
               [Windows only] Use host serial port n

           udp:[remote_host]:remote_port[@[src_ip]:src_port]
               This implements UDP Net Console.  When remote_host or src_ip are not specified they default to 0.0.0.0.  When not using a specified
               src_port a random port is automatically chosen.

               If you just want a simple readonly console you can use "netcat" or "nc", by starting QEMU with: "-serial udp::4555" and nc as: "nc
               -u -l -p 4555". Any time QEMU writes something to that port it will appear in the netconsole session.

               If you plan to send characters back via netconsole or you want to stop and start QEMU a lot of times, you should have QEMU use the
               same source port each time by using something like "-serial udp::4555@4556" to QEMU. Another approach is to use a patched version
               of netcat which can listen to a TCP port and send and receive characters via udp.  If you have a patched version of netcat which
               activates telnet remote echo and single char transfer, then you can use the following options to set up a netcat redirector to
               allow telnet on port 5555 to access the QEMU port.

               "QEMU Options:"
                   -serial udp::4555@4556

               "netcat options:"
                   -u -P 4555 -L 0.0.0.0:4556 -t -p 5555 -I -T

                   localhost 5555

           tcp:[host]:port[,server][,nowait][,nodelay][,reconnect=seconds]
               The TCP Net Console has two modes of operation.  It can send the serial I/O to a location or wait for a connection from a location.
               By default the TCP Net Console is sent to host at the port.  If you use the server option QEMU will wait for a client socket
               application to connect to the port before continuing, unless the "nowait" option was specified.  The "nodelay" option disables the
               Nagle buffering algorithm.  The "reconnect" option only applies if noserver is set, if the connection goes down it will attempt to
               reconnect at the given interval.  If host is omitted, 0.0.0.0 is assumed. Only one TCP connection at a time is accepted. You can
               use "telnet" to connect to the corresponding character device.

               "Example to send tcp console to 192.168.0.2 port 4444"
                   -serial tcp:192.168.0.2:4444

               "Example to listen and wait on port 4444 for connection"
                   -serial tcp::4444,server

               "Example to not wait and listen on ip 192.168.0.100 port 4444"
                   -serial tcp:192.168.0.100:4444,server,nowait

           telnet:host:port[,server][,nowait][,nodelay]
               The telnet protocol is used instead of raw tcp sockets.  The options work the same as if you had specified "-serial tcp".  The
               difference is that the port acts like a telnet server or client using telnet option negotiation.  This will also allow you to send
               the MAGIC_SYSRQ sequence if you use a telnet that supports sending the break sequence.  Typically in unix telnet you do it with
               Control-] and then type "send break" followed by pressing the enter key.

           unix:path[,server][,nowait][,reconnect=seconds]
               A unix domain socket is used instead of a tcp socket.  The option works the same as if you had specified "-serial tcp" except the
               unix domain socket path is used for connections.

           mon:dev_string
               This is a special option to allow the monitor to be multiplexed onto another serial port.  The monitor is accessed with key
               sequence of Control-a and then pressing c.  dev_string should be any one of the serial devices specified above.  An example to
               multiplex the monitor onto a telnet server listening on port 4444 would be:

               "-serial mon:telnet::4444,server,nowait"

               When the monitor is multiplexed to stdio in this way, Ctrl+C will not terminate QEMU any more but will be passed to the guest
               instead.

           braille
               Braille device.  This will use BrlAPI to display the braille output on a real or fake device.

           msmouse
               Three button serial mouse. Configure the guest to use Microsoft protocol.

       -parallel dev
           Redirect the virtual parallel port to host device dev (same devices as the serial port). On Linux hosts, /dev/parportN can be used to
           use hardware devices connected on the corresponding host parallel port.

           This option can be used several times to simulate up to 3 parallel ports.

           Use "-parallel none" to disable all parallel ports.

       -monitor dev
           Redirect the monitor to host device dev (same devices as the serial port).  The default device is "vc" in graphical mode and "stdio" in
           non graphical mode.  Use "-monitor none" to disable the default monitor.

       -qmp dev
           Like -monitor but opens in 'control' mode.

       -qmp-pretty dev
           Like -qmp but uses pretty JSON formatting.

       -mon [chardev=]name[,mode=readline|control][,pretty[=on|off]]
           Setup monitor on chardev name. "pretty" turns on JSON pretty printing easing human reading and debugging.

       -debugcon dev
           Redirect the debug console to host device dev (same devices as the serial port).  The debug console is an I/O port which is typically
           port 0xe9; writing to that I/O port sends output to this device.  The default device is "vc" in graphical mode and "stdio" in non
           graphical mode.

       -pidfile file
           Store the QEMU process PID in file. It is useful if you launch QEMU from a script.

       -singlestep
           Run the emulation in single step mode.

       -S  Do not start CPU at startup (you must type 'c' in the monitor).

       -realtime mlock=on|off
           Run qemu with realtime features.  mlocking qemu and guest memory can be enabled via mlock=on (enabled by default).

       -gdb dev
           Wait for gdb connection on device dev. Typical connections will likely be TCP-based, but also UDP, pseudo TTY, or even stdio are
           reasonable use case. The latter is allowing to start QEMU from within gdb and establish the connection via a pipe:

                   (gdb) target remote | exec qemu-system-i386 -gdb stdio ...

       -s  Shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234, i.e. open a gdbserver on TCP port 1234.

       -d item1[,...]
           Enable logging of specified items. Use '-d help' for a list of log items.

       -D logfile
           Output log in logfile instead of to stderr

       -dfilter range1[,...]
           Filter debug output to that relevant to a range of target addresses. The filter spec can be either start+size, start-size or start..end
           where start end and size are the addresses and sizes required. For example:

                   -dfilter 0x8000..0x8fff,0xffffffc000080000+0x200,0xffffffc000060000-0x1000

           Will dump output for any code in the 0x1000 sized block starting at 0x8000 and the 0x200 sized block starting at 0xffffffc000080000 and
           another 0x1000 sized block starting at 0xffffffc00005f000.

       -L  path
           Set the directory for the BIOS, VGA BIOS and keymaps.

           To list all the data directories, use "-L help".

       -bios file
           Set the filename for the BIOS.

       -enable-kvm
           Enable KVM full virtualization support. This option is only available if KVM support is enabled when compiling.

       -enable-hax
           Enable HAX (Hardware-based Acceleration eXecution) support. This option is only available if HAX support is enabled when compiling. HAX
           is only applicable to MAC and Windows platform, and thus does not conflict with KVM.

       -xen-domid id
           Specify xen guest domain id (XEN only).

       -xen-create
           Create domain using xen hypercalls, bypassing xend.  Warning: should not be used when xend is in use (XEN only).

       -xen-attach
           Attach to existing xen domain.  xend will use this when starting QEMU (XEN only).  Restrict set of available xen operations to
           specified domain id (XEN only).

       -no-reboot
           Exit instead of rebooting.

       -no-shutdown
           Don't exit QEMU on guest shutdown, but instead only stop the emulation.  This allows for instance switching to monitor to commit
           changes to the disk image.

       -loadvm file
           Start right away with a saved state ("loadvm" in monitor)

       -daemonize
           Daemonize the QEMU process after initialization.  QEMU will not detach from standard IO until it is ready to receive connections on any
           of its devices.  This option is a useful way for external programs to launch QEMU without having to cope with initialization race
           conditions.

       -option-rom file
           Load the contents of file as an option ROM.  This option is useful to load things like EtherBoot.

       -rtc [base=utc|localtime|date][,clock=host|vm][,driftfix=none|slew]
           Specify base as "utc" or "localtime" to let the RTC start at the current UTC or local time, respectively. "localtime" is required for
           correct date in MS-DOS or Windows. To start at a specific point in time, provide date in the format "2006-06-17T16:01:21" or
           "2006-06-17". The default base is UTC.

           By default the RTC is driven by the host system time. This allows using of the RTC as accurate reference clock inside the guest,
           specifically if the host time is smoothly following an accurate external reference clock, e.g. via NTP.  If you want to isolate the
           guest time from the host, you can set clock to "rt" instead.  To even prevent it from progressing during suspension, you can set it to
           "vm".

           Enable driftfix (i386 targets only) if you experience time drift problems, specifically with Windows' ACPI HAL. This option will try to
           figure out how many timer interrupts were not processed by the Windows guest and will re-inject them.

       -icount [shift=N|auto][,rr=record|replay,rrfile=filename,rrsnapshot=snapshot]
           Enable virtual instruction counter.  The virtual cpu will execute one instruction every 2^N ns of virtual time.  If "auto" is specified
           then the virtual cpu speed will be automatically adjusted to keep virtual time within a few seconds of real time.

           When the virtual cpu is sleeping, the virtual time will advance at default speed unless sleep=on|off is specified.  With sleep=on|off,
           the virtual time will jump to the next timer deadline instantly whenever the virtual cpu goes to sleep mode and will not advance if no
           timer is enabled. This behavior give deterministic execution times from the guest point of view.

           Note that while this option can give deterministic behavior, it does not provide cycle accurate emulation.  Modern CPUs contain
           superscalar out of order cores with complex cache hierarchies.  The number of instructions executed often has little or no correlation
           with actual performance.

           align=on will activate the delay algorithm which will try to synchronise the host clock and the virtual clock. The goal is to have a
           guest running at the real frequency imposed by the shift option.  Whenever the guest clock is behind the host clock and if align=on is
           specified then we print a message to the user to inform about the delay.  Currently this option does not work when shift is "auto".
           Note: The sync algorithm will work for those shift values for which the guest clock runs ahead of the host clock. Typically this
           happens when the shift value is high (how high depends on the host machine).

           When rr option is specified deterministic record/replay is enabled.  Replay log is written into filename file in record mode and read
           from this file in replay mode.

           Option rrsnapshot is used to create new vm snapshot named snapshot at the start of execution recording. In replay mode this option is
           used to load the initial VM state.

       -watchdog model
           Create a virtual hardware watchdog device.  Once enabled (by a guest action), the watchdog must be periodically polled by an agent
           inside the guest or else the guest will be restarted. Choose a model for which your guest has drivers.

           The model is the model of hardware watchdog to emulate. Use "-watchdog help" to list available hardware models. Only one watchdog can
           be enabled for a guest.

           The following models may be available:

           ib700
               iBASE 700 is a very simple ISA watchdog with a single timer.

           i6300esb
               Intel 6300ESB I/O controller hub is a much more featureful PCI-based dual-timer watchdog.

           diag288
               A virtual watchdog for s390x backed by the diagnose 288 hypercall (currently KVM only).

       -watchdog-action action
           The action controls what QEMU will do when the watchdog timer expires.  The default is "reset" (forcefully reset the guest).  Other
           possible actions are: "shutdown" (attempt to gracefully shutdown the guest), "poweroff" (forcefully poweroff the guest), "inject-nmi"
           (inject a NMI into the guest), "pause" (pause the guest), "debug" (print a debug message and continue), or "none" (do nothing).

           Note that the "shutdown" action requires that the guest responds to ACPI signals, which it may not be able to do in the sort of
           situations where the watchdog would have expired, and thus "-watchdog-action shutdown" is not recommended for production use.

           Examples:

           "-watchdog i6300esb -watchdog-action pause"
           "-watchdog ib700"
       -echr numeric_ascii_value
           Change the escape character used for switching to the monitor when using monitor and serial sharing.  The default is 0x01 when using
           the "-nographic" option.  0x01 is equal to pressing "Control-a".  You can select a different character from the ascii control keys
           where 1 through 26 map to Control-a through Control-z.  For instance you could use the either of the following to change the escape
           character to Control-t.

           "-echr 0x14"
           "-echr 20"
       -virtioconsole c
           Set virtio console.

           This option is maintained for backward compatibility.

           Please use "-device virtconsole" for the new way of invocation.

       -show-cursor
           Show cursor.

       -tb-size n
           Set TB size.

       -incoming tcp:[host]:port[,to=maxport][,ipv4][,ipv6]
       -incoming rdma:host:port[,ipv4][,ipv6]
           Prepare for incoming migration, listen on a given tcp port.

       -incoming unix:socketpath
           Prepare for incoming migration, listen on a given unix socket.

       -incoming fd:fd
           Accept incoming migration from a given filedescriptor.

       -incoming exec:cmdline
           Accept incoming migration as an output from specified external command.

       -incoming defer
           Wait for the URI to be specified via migrate_incoming.  The monitor can be used to change settings (such as migration parameters) prior
           to issuing the migrate_incoming to allow the migration to begin.

       -only-migratable
           Only allow migratable devices. Devices will not be allowed to enter an unmigratable state.

       -nodefaults
           Don't create default devices. Normally, QEMU sets the default devices like serial port, parallel port, virtual console, monitor device,
           VGA adapter, floppy and CD-ROM drive and others. The "-nodefaults" option will disable all those default devices.

       -chroot dir
           Immediately before starting guest execution, chroot to the specified directory.  Especially useful in combination with -runas.

       -runas user
           Immediately before starting guest execution, drop root privileges, switching to the specified user.

       -prom-env variable=value
           Set OpenBIOS nvram variable to given value (PPC, SPARC only).

       -semihosting
           Enable semihosting mode (ARM, M68K, Xtensa, MIPS only).

       -semihosting-config [enable=on|off][,target=native|gdb|auto][,arg=str[,...]]
           Enable and configure semihosting (ARM, M68K, Xtensa, MIPS only).

           target="native|gdb|auto"
               Defines where the semihosting calls will be addressed, to QEMU ("native") or to GDB ("gdb"). The default is "auto", which means
               "gdb" during debug sessions and "native" otherwise.

           arg=str1,arg=str2,...
               Allows the user to pass input arguments, and can be used multiple times to build up a list. The old-style "-kernel"/"-append"
               method of passing a command line is still supported for backward compatibility. If both the "--semihosting-config arg" and the
               "-kernel"/"-append" are specified, the former is passed to semihosting as it always takes precedence.

       -old-param
           Old param mode (ARM only).

       -sandbox arg[,obsolete=string][,elevateprivileges=string][,spawn=string][,resourcecontrol=string]
           Enable Seccomp mode 2 system call filter. 'on' will enable syscall filtering and 'off' will disable it.  The default is 'off'.

           obsolete=string
               Enable Obsolete system calls

           elevateprivileges=string
               Disable set*uid|gid system calls

           spawn=string
               Disable *fork and execve

           resourcecontrol=string
               Disable process affinity and schedular priority

       -readconfig file
           Read device configuration from file. This approach is useful when you want to spawn QEMU process with many command line options but you
           don't want to exceed the command line character limit.

       -writeconfig file
           Write device configuration to file. The file can be either filename to save command line and device configuration into file or dash
           "-") character to print the output to stdout. This can be later used as input file for "-readconfig" option.

       -no-user-config
           The "-no-user-config" option makes QEMU not load any of the user-provided config files on sysconfdir.

       -trace [[enable=]pattern][,events=file][,file=file]
           Specify tracing options.

           [enable=]pattern
               Immediately enable events matching pattern.  The file must contain one event name (as listed in the trace-events-all file) per
               line; globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log or ftrace
               tracing backend.  To specify multiple events or patterns, specify the -trace option multiple times.

               Use "-trace help" to print a list of names of trace points.

           events=file
               Immediately enable events listed in file.  The file must contain one event name (as listed in the trace-events-all file) per line;
               globbing patterns are accepted too.  This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple, log or ftrace tracing
               backend.

           file=file
               Log output traces to file.  This option is only available if QEMU has been compiled with the simple tracing backend.

       -enable-fips
           Enable FIPS 140-2 compliance mode.

       -msg timestamp[=on|off]
           prepend a timestamp to each log message.(default:on)

       -dump-vmstate file
           Dump json-encoded vmstate information for current machine type to file in file

       Generic object creation

       -object typename[,prop1=value1,...]
           Create a new object of type typename setting properties in the order they are specified.  Note that the 'id' property must be set.
           These objects are placed in the '/objects' path.

           -object
           memory-backend-file,id=id,size=size,mem-path=dir,share=on|off,discard-data=on|off,merge=on|off,dump=on|off,prealloc=on|off,host-nodes=host-
           nodes,policy=default|preferred|bind|interleave,align=align
               Creates a memory file backend object, which can be used to back the guest RAM with huge pages.

               The id parameter is a unique ID that will be used to reference this memory region when configuring the -numa argument.

               The size option provides the size of the memory region, and accepts common suffixes, eg 500M.

               The mem-path provides the path to either a shared memory or huge page filesystem mount.

               The share boolean option determines whether the memory region is marked as private to QEMU, or shared. The latter allows a co-
               operating external process to access the QEMU memory region.

               The share is also required for pvrdma devices due to limitations in the RDMA API provided by Linux.

               Setting share=on might affect the ability to configure NUMA bindings for the memory backend under some circumstances, see
               Documentation/vm/numa_memory_policy.txt on the Linux kernel source tree for additional details.

               Setting the discard-data boolean option to on indicates that file contents can be destroyed when QEMU exits, to avoid unnecessarily
               flushing data to the backing file.  Note that discard-data is only an optimization, and QEMU might not discard file contents if it
               aborts unexpectedly or is terminated using SIGKILL.

               The merge boolean option enables memory merge, also known as MADV_MERGEABLE, so that Kernel Samepage Merging will consider the
               pages for memory deduplication.

               Setting the dump boolean option to off excludes the memory from core dumps. This feature is also known as MADV_DONTDUMP.

               The prealloc boolean option enables memory preallocation.

               The host-nodes option binds the memory range to a list of NUMA host nodes.

               The policy option sets the NUMA policy to one of the following values:

               default
                   default host policy

               preferred
                   prefer the given host node list for allocation

               bind
                   restrict memory allocation to the given host node list

               interleave
                   interleave memory allocations across the given host node list

               The align option specifies the base address alignment when QEMU mmap(2) mem-path, and accepts common suffixes, eg 2M. Some backend
               store specified by mem-path requires an alignment different than the default one used by QEMU, eg the device DAX /dev/dax0.0
               requires 2M alignment rather than 4K. In such cases, users can specify the required alignment via this option.

           -object memory-backend-ram,id=id,merge=on|off,dump=on|off,share=on|off,prealloc=on|off,size=size,host-nodes=host-
           nodes,policy=default|preferred|bind|interleave
               Creates a memory backend object, which can be used to back the guest RAM.  Memory backend objects offer more control than the -m
               option that is traditionally used to define guest RAM. Please refer to memory-backend-file for a description of the options.

           -object memory-backend-memfd,id=id,merge=on|off,dump=on|off,prealloc=on|off,size=size,host-nodes=host-
           nodes,policy=default|preferred|bind|interleave,seal=on|off,hugetlb=on|off,hugetlbsize=size
               Creates an anonymous memory file backend object, which allows QEMU to share the memory with an external process (e.g. when using
               vhost-user). The memory is allocated with memfd and optional sealing. (Linux only)

               The seal option creates a sealed-file, that will block further resizing the memory ('on' by default).

               The hugetlb option specify the file to be created resides in the hugetlbfs filesystem (since Linux 4.14).  Used in conjunction with
               the hugetlb option, the hugetlbsize option specify the hugetlb page size on systems that support multiple hugetlb page sizes (it
               must be a power of 2 value supported by the system).

               In some versions of Linux, the hugetlb option is incompatible with the seal option (requires at least Linux 4.16).

               Please refer to memory-backend-file for a description of the other options.

           -object rng-random,id=id,filename=/dev/random
               Creates a random number generator backend which obtains entropy from a device on the host. The id parameter is a unique ID that
               will be used to reference this entropy backend from the virtio-rng device. The filename parameter specifies which file to obtain
               entropy from and if omitted defaults to /dev/random.

           -object rng-egd,id=id,chardev=chardevid
               Creates a random number generator backend which obtains entropy from an external daemon running on the host. The id parameter is a
               unique ID that will be used to reference this entropy backend from the virtio-rng device. The chardev parameter is the unique ID of
               a character device backend that provides the connection to the RNG daemon.

           -object tls-creds-anon,id=id,endpoint=endpoint,dir=/path/to/cred/dir,verify-peer=on|off
               Creates a TLS anonymous credentials object, which can be used to provide TLS support on network backends. The id parameter is a
               unique ID which network backends will use to access the credentials. The endpoint is either server or client depending on whether
               the QEMU network backend that uses the credentials will be acting as a client or as a server. If verify-peer is enabled (the
               default) then once the handshake is completed, the peer credentials will be verified, though this is a no-op for anonymous
               credentials.

               The dir parameter tells QEMU where to find the credential files. For server endpoints, this directory may contain a file
               dh-params.pem providing diffie-hellman parameters to use for the TLS server. If the file is missing, QEMU will generate a set of DH
               parameters at startup. This is a computationally expensive operation that consumes random pool entropy, so it is recommended that a
               persistent set of parameters be generated upfront and saved.

           -object tls-creds-x509,id=id,endpoint=endpoint,dir=/path/to/cred/dir,priority=priority,verify-peer=on|off,passwordid=id
               Creates a TLS anonymous credentials object, which can be used to provide TLS support on network backends. The id parameter is a
               unique ID which network backends will use to access the credentials. The endpoint is either server or client depending on whether
               the QEMU network backend that uses the credentials will be acting as a client or as a server. If verify-peer is enabled (the
               default) then once the handshake is completed, the peer credentials will be verified. With x509 certificates, this implies that the
               clients must be provided with valid client certificates too.

               The dir parameter tells QEMU where to find the credential files. For server endpoints, this directory may contain a file
               dh-params.pem providing diffie-hellman parameters to use for the TLS server. If the file is missing, QEMU will generate a set of DH
               parameters at startup. This is a computationally expensive operation that consumes random pool entropy, so it is recommended that a
               persistent set of parameters be generated upfront and saved.

               For x509 certificate credentials the directory will contain further files providing the x509 certificates. The certificates must be
               stored in PEM format, in filenames ca-cert.pem, ca-crl.pem (optional), server-cert.pem (only servers), server-key.pem (only
               servers), client-cert.pem (only clients), and client-key.pem (only clients).

               For the server-key.pem and client-key.pem files which contain sensitive private keys, it is possible to use an encrypted version by
               providing the passwordid parameter. This provides the ID of a previously created "secret" object containing the password for
               decryption.

               The priority parameter allows to override the global default priority used by gnutls. This can be useful if the system
               administrator needs to use a weaker set of crypto priorities for QEMU without potentially forcing the weakness onto all
               applications. Or conversely if one wants wants a stronger default for QEMU than for all other applications, they can do this
               through this parameter. Its format is a gnutls priority string as described at
               <https://gnutls.org/manual/html_node/Priority-Strings.html>.

           -object filter-buffer,id=id,netdev=netdevid,interval=t[,queue=all|rx|tx][,status=on|off]
               Interval t can't be 0, this filter batches the packet delivery: all packets arriving in a given interval on netdev netdevid are
               delayed until the end of the interval. Interval is in microseconds.  status is optional that indicate whether the netfilter is on
               (enabled) or off (disabled), the default status for netfilter will be 'on'.

               queue all|rx|tx is an option that can be applied to any netfilter.

               all: the filter is attached both to the receive and the transmit queue of the netdev (default).

               rx: the filter is attached to the receive queue of the netdev, where it will receive packets sent to the netdev.

               tx: the filter is attached to the transmit queue of the netdev, where it will receive packets sent by the netdev.

               has the vnet_hdr_support flag, filter-redirector will redirect packet with vnet_hdr_len.  Create a filter-redirector we need to
               differ outdev id from indev id, id can not be the same. we can just use indev or outdev, but at least one of indev or outdev need
               to be specified.

           -object filter-rewriter,id=id,netdev=netdevid,queue=all|rx|tx,[vnet_hdr_support]
               Filter-rewriter is a part of COLO project.It will rewrite tcp packet to secondary from primary to keep secondary tcp connection,and
               rewrite tcp packet to primary from secondary make tcp packet can be handled by client.if it has the vnet_hdr_support flag, we can
               parse packet with vnet header.

               Dump the network traffic on netdev dev to the file specified by filename. At most len bytes (64k by default) per packet are stored.
               The file format is libpcap, so it can be analyzed with tools such as tcpdump or Wireshark.

           -object colo-compare,id=id,primary_in=chardevid,secondary_in=chardevid,outdev=chardevid[,vnet_hdr_support]
               Colo-compare gets packet from primary_inchardevid and secondary_inchardevid, than compare primary packet with secondary packet. If
               the packets are same, we will output primary packet to outdevchardevid, else we will notify colo-frame do checkpoint and send
               primary packet to outdevchardevid.  if it has the vnet_hdr_support flag, colo compare will send/recv packet with vnet_hdr_len.

               we must use it with the help of filter-mirror and filter-redirector.

           -object cryptodev-backend-builtin,id=id[,queues=queues]
               Creates a cryptodev backend which executes crypto opreation from the QEMU cipher APIS. The id parameter is a unique ID that will be
               used to reference this cryptodev backend from the virtio-crypto device. The queues parameter is optional, which specify the queue

           -object secret,id=id,data=string,format=raw|base64[,keyid=secretid,iv=string]
           -object secret,id=id,file=filename,format=raw|base64[,keyid=secretid,iv=string]
               Defines a secret to store a password, encryption key, or some other sensitive data. The sensitive data can either be passed
               directly via the data parameter, or indirectly via the file parameter. Using the data parameter is insecure unless the sensitive
               data is encrypted.

               The sensitive data can be provided in raw format (the default), or base64.  When encoded as JSON, the raw format only supports
               valid UTF-8 characters, so base64 is recommended for sending binary data. QEMU will convert from which ever format is provided to
               the format it needs internally. eg, an RBD password can be provided in raw format, even though it will be base64 encoded when
               passed onto the RBD sever.

               For added protection, it is possible to encrypt the data associated with a secret using the AES-256-CBC cipher. Use of encryption
               is indicated by providing the keyid and iv parameters. The keyid parameter provides the ID of a previously defined secret that
               contains the AES-256 decryption key. This key should be 32-bytes long and be base64 encoded. The iv parameter provides the random
               initialization vector used for encryption of this particular secret and should be a base64 encrypted string of the 16-byte IV.

               The simplest (insecure) usage is to provide the secret inline

                       # $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,data=letmein,format=raw

               The simplest secure usage is to provide the secret via a file

               # printf "letmein" > mypasswd.txt # $QEMU -object secret,id=sec0,file=mypasswd.txt,format=raw

               For greater security, AES-256-CBC should be used. To illustrate usage, consider the openssl command line tool which can encrypt the
               data. Note that when encrypting, the plaintext must be padded to the cipher block size (32 bytes) using the standard PKCS#5/6
               compatible padding algorithm.

               First a master key needs to be created in base64 encoding:

                       # openssl rand -base64 32 > key.b64
                       # KEY=$(base64 -d key.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')

               Each secret to be encrypted needs to have a random initialization vector generated. These do not need to be kept secret

                       # openssl rand -base64 16 > iv.b64
                       # IV=$(base64 -d iv.b64 | hexdump  -v -e '/1 "%02X"')

               The secret to be defined can now be encrypted, in this case we're telling openssl to base64 encode the result, but it could be left
               as raw bytes if desired.

                       # SECRET=$(printf "letmein" |
                       openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -K $KEY -iv $IV)

               When launching QEMU, create a master secret pointing to "key.b64" and specify that to be used to decrypt the user password. Pass
               the contents of "iv.b64" to the second secret

                       # $QEMU \
                       -object secret,id=secmaster0,format=base64,file=key.b64 \
                       -object secret,id=sec0,keyid=secmaster0,format=base64,\
                       data=$SECRET,iv=$(<iv.b64)

           -object
           sev-guest,id=id,cbitpos=cbitpos,reduced-phys-bits=val,[sev-device=string,policy=policy,handle=handle,dh-cert-file=file,session-file=file]
               Create a Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) guest object, which can be used to provide the guest memory encryption support on
               AMD processors.

               When memory encryption is enabled, one of the physical address bit (aka the C-bit) is utilized to mark if a memory page is
               protected. The cbitpos is used to provide the C-bit position. The C-bit position is Host family dependent hence user must provide
               this value. On EPYC, the value should be 47.

               When memory encryption is enabled, we loose certain bits in physical address space.  The reduced-phys-bits is used to provide the
               number of bits we loose in physical address space. Similar to C-bit, the value is Host family dependent.  On EPYC, the value should
               be 5.

               The sev-device provides the device file to use for communicating with the SEV firmware running inside AMD Secure Processor. The
               default device is '/dev/sev'. If hardware supports memory encryption then /dev/sev devices are created by CCP driver.

               The policy provides the guest policy to be enforced by the SEV firmware and restrict what configuration and operational commands
               can be performed on this guest by the hypervisor. The policy should be provided by the guest owner and is bound to the guest and
               cannot be changed throughout the lifetime of the guest.  The default is 0.

               If guest policy allows sharing the key with another SEV guest then handle can be use to provide handle of the guest from which to
               share the key.

               The dh-cert-file and session-file provides the guest owner's Public Diffie-Hillman key defined in SEV spec. The PDH and session
               parameters are used for establishing a cryptographic session with the guest owner to negotiate keys used for attestation. The file
               must be encoded in base64.

               e.g to launch a SEV guest

                       # $QEMU \
                       ......
                       -object sev-guest,id=sev0,cbitpos=47,reduced-phys-bits=5 \
                       -machine ...,memory-encryption=sev0
                       .....

       During the graphical emulation, you can use special key combinations to change modes. The default key mappings are shown below, but if you
       use "-alt-grab" then the modifier is Ctrl-Alt-Shift (instead of Ctrl-Alt) and if you use "-ctrl-grab" then the modifier is the right Ctrl
       key (instead of Ctrl-Alt):

       Ctrl-Alt-f
           Toggle full screen

       Ctrl-Alt-+
           Enlarge the screen

       Ctrl-Alt--
           Shrink the screen

       Ctrl-Alt-u
           Restore the screen's un-scaled dimensions

       Ctrl-Alt-n
           Switch to virtual console 'n'. Standard console mappings are:

           1   Target system display

           2   Monitor

           3   Serial port

       Ctrl-Alt
           Toggle mouse and keyboard grab.

       In the virtual consoles, you can use Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown to move in the back log.

       During emulation, if you are using a character backend multiplexer (which is the default if you are using -nographic) then several commands
       are available via an escape sequence. These key sequences all start with an escape character, which is Ctrl-a by default, but can be
       changed with -echr. The list below assumes you're using the default.

       Ctrl-a h
           Print this help

       Ctrl-a x
           Exit emulator

       Ctrl-a s
           Save disk data back to file (if -snapshot)

       Ctrl-a t
           Toggle console timestamps

       Ctrl-a b
           Send break (magic sysrq in Linux)

       Ctrl-a c
           Rotate between the frontends connected to the multiplexer (usually this switches between the monitor and the console)

       Ctrl-a Ctrl-a
           Send the escape character to the frontend

       The following options are specific to the PowerPC emulation:

       -g WxH[xDEPTH]
           Set the initial VGA graphic mode. The default is 800x600x32.

       -prom-env string
           Set OpenBIOS variables in NVRAM, for example:

                   qemu-system-ppc -prom-env 'auto-boot?=false' \
                    -prom-env 'boot-device=hd:2,\yaboot' \
                    -prom-env 'boot-args=conf=hd:2,\yaboot.conf'

           These variables are not used by Open Hack'Ware.

       The following options are specific to the Sparc32 emulation:

       -g WxHx[xDEPTH]
           Set the initial graphics mode. For TCX, the default is 1024x768x8 with the option of 1024x768x24. For cgthree, the default is
           1024x768x8 with the option of 1152x900x8 for people who wish to use OBP.

       -prom-env string
           Set OpenBIOS variables in NVRAM, for example:

                   qemu-system-sparc -prom-env 'auto-boot?=false' \
                    -prom-env 'boot-device=sd(0,2,0):d' -prom-env 'boot-args=linux single'

       -M [SS-4|SS-5|SS-10|SS-20|SS-600MP|LX|Voyager|SPARCClassic] [|SPARCbook]
           Set the emulated machine type. Default is SS-5.

       The following options are specific to the Sparc64 emulation:

       -prom-env string
           Set OpenBIOS variables in NVRAM, for example:

                   qemu-system-sparc64 -prom-env 'auto-boot?=false'

       -M [sun4u|sun4v|niagara]
           Set the emulated machine type. The default is sun4u.

       The following options are specific to the ARM emulation:

       -semihosting
           Enable semihosting syscall emulation.

           On ARM this implements the "Angel" interface.

           Note that this allows guest direct access to the host filesystem, so should only be used with trusted guest OS.

       The following options are specific to the ColdFire emulation:

       -semihosting
           Enable semihosting syscall emulation.

           On M68K this implements the "ColdFire GDB" interface used by libgloss.

           Note that this allows guest direct access to the host filesystem, so should only be used with trusted guest OS.

       The following options are specific to the Xtensa emulation:

       -semihosting
           Enable semihosting syscall emulation.

           Xtensa semihosting provides basic file IO calls, such as open/read/write/seek/select.  Tensilica baremetal libc for ISS and linux
           platform "sim" use this interface.

           Note that this allows guest direct access to the host filesystem, so should only be used with trusted guest OS.

NOTES
       In addition to using normal file images for the emulated storage devices, QEMU can also use networked resources such as iSCSI devices.
       These are specified using a special URL syntax.

       iSCSI
           iSCSI support allows QEMU to access iSCSI resources directly and use as images for the guest storage. Both disk and cdrom images are
           supported.

           Syntax for specifying iSCSI LUNs is "iscsi://<target-ip>[:<port>]/<target-iqn>/<lun>"

           By default qemu will use the iSCSI initiator-name 'iqn.2008-11.org.linux-kvm[:<name>]' but this can also be set from the command line
           or a configuration file.

           Since version Qemu 2.4 it is possible to specify a iSCSI request timeout to detect stalled requests and force a reestablishment of the
           session. The timeout is specified in seconds. The default is 0 which means no timeout. Libiscsi 1.15.0 or greater is required for this
           feature.

           Example (without authentication):

                   qemu-system-i386 -iscsi initiator-name=iqn.2001-04.com.example:my-initiator \
                                    -cdrom iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/2 \
                                    -drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1

           Example (CHAP username/password via URL):

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://user%password@192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1

           Example (CHAP username/password via environment variables):

                   LIBISCSI_CHAP_USERNAME="user" \
                   LIBISCSI_CHAP_PASSWORD="password" \
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=iscsi://192.0.2.1/iqn.2001-04.com.example/1

       NBD QEMU supports NBD (Network Block Devices) both using TCP protocol as well as Unix Domain Sockets.

           Syntax for specifying a NBD device using TCP "nbd:<server-ip>:<port>[:exportname=<export>]"

           Syntax for specifying a NBD device using Unix Domain Sockets "nbd:unix:<domain-socket>[:exportname=<export>]"

           Example for TCP

                   qemu-system-i386 --drive file=nbd:192.0.2.1:30000

           Example for Unix Domain Sockets

                   qemu-system-i386 --drive file=nbd:unix:/tmp/nbd-socket

       SSH QEMU supports SSH (Secure Shell) access to remote disks.

           Examples:

                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file=ssh://user@host/path/to/disk.img
                   qemu-system-i386 -drive file.driver=ssh,file.user=user,file.host=host,file.port=22,file.path=/path/to/disk.img

           Currently authentication must be done using ssh-agent.  Other authentication methods may be supported in future.

       Sheepdog
           Sheepdog is a distributed storage system for QEMU.  QEMU supports using either local sheepdog devices or remote networked devices.

           Syntax for specifying a sheepdog device

                   sheepdog[+tcp|+unix]://[host:port]/vdiname[?socket=path][#snapid|#tag]

           Example

                   qemu-system-i386 --drive file=sheepdog://192.0.2.1:30000/MyVirtualMachine

           See also <https://sheepdog.github.io/sheepdog/>.

       GlusterFS
           GlusterFS is a user space distributed file system.  QEMU supports the use of GlusterFS volumes for hosting VM disk images using TCP,
           Unix Domain Sockets and RDMA transport protocols.

           Syntax for specifying a VM disk image on GlusterFS volume is

                   URI:
                   gluster[+type]://[host[:port]]/volume/path[?socket=...][,debug=N][,logfile=...]

                   JSON:
                   'json:{"driver":"qcow2","file":{"driver":"gluster","volume":"testvol","path":"a.img","debug":N,"logfile":"...",
                                                    "server":[{"type":"tcp","host":"...","port":"..."},
                                                              {"type":"unix","socket":"..."}]}}'

           Example

                   URI:
                   qemu-system-x86_64 --drive file=gluster://192.0.2.1/testvol/a.img,
                                                  file.debug=9,file.logfile=/var/log/qemu-gluster.log

                   JSON:
                   qemu-system-x86_64 'json:{"driver":"qcow2",
                                             "file":{"driver":"gluster",
                                                      "volume":"testvol","path":"a.img",
                                                      "debug":9,"logfile":"/var/log/qemu-gluster.log",
                                                      "server":[{"type":"tcp","host":"1.2.3.4","port":24007},
                                                                {"type":"unix","socket":"/var/run/glusterd.socket"}]}}'
                   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive driver=qcow2,file.driver=gluster,file.volume=testvol,file.path=/path/a.img,
                                                         file.debug=9,file.logfile=/var/log/qemu-gluster.log,
                                                         file.server.0.type=tcp,file.server.0.host=1.2.3.4,file.server.0.port=24007,
                                                         file.server.1.type=unix,file.server.1.socket=/var/run/glusterd.socket

           See also <http://www.gluster.org>.

       HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS
           QEMU supports read-only access to files accessed over http(s) and ftp(s).

           Syntax using a single filename:

                   <protocol>://[<username>[:<password>]@]<host>/<path>

           where:

           protocol
               'http', 'https', 'ftp', or 'ftps'.

           username
               Optional username for authentication to the remote server.

           password
               Optional password for authentication to the remote server.

           host
               Address of the remote server.

           path
               Path on the remote server, including any query string.

           The following options are also supported:

           url The full URL when passing options to the driver explicitly.

           readahead
               The amount of data to read ahead with each range request to the remote server.  This value may optionally have the suffix 'T', 'G',
               'M', 'K', 'k' or 'b'. If it does not have a suffix, it will be assumed to be in bytes. The value must be a multiple of 512 bytes.
               It defaults to 256k.

           sslverify
               Whether to verify the remote server's certificate when connecting over SSL. It can have the value 'on' or 'off'. It defaults to
               'on'.

           cookie
               Send this cookie (it can also be a list of cookies separated by ';') with each outgoing request.  Only supported when using
               protocols such as HTTP which support cookies, otherwise ignored.

           timeout
               Set the timeout in seconds of the CURL connection. This timeout is the time that CURL waits for a response from the remote server
               to get the size of the image to be downloaded. If not set, the default timeout of 5 seconds is used.

           Note that when passing options to qemu explicitly, driver is the value of <protocol>.

           Example: boot from a remote Fedora 20 live ISO image

                   qemu-system-x86_64 --drive media=cdrom,file=http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Live/x86_64/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso,readonly

                   qemu-system-x86_64 --drive media=cdrom,file.driver=http,file.url=http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Live/x86_64/Fedora-Live-Desktop-x86_64-20-1.iso,readonly

           Example: boot from a remote Fedora 20 cloud image using a local overlay for writes, copy-on-read, and a readahead of 64k

                   qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file='json:{"file.driver":"http",, "file.url":"https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Images/x86_64/Fedora-x86_64-20-20131211.1-sda.qcow2",, "file.readahead":"64k"}' /tmp/Fedora-x86_64-20-20131211.1-sda.qcow2

                   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=/tmp/Fedora-x86_64-20-20131211.1-sda.qcow2,copy-on-read=on

           Example: boot from an image stored on a VMware vSphere server with a self-signed certificate using a local overlay for writes, a
           readahead of 64k and a timeout of 10 seconds.

                   qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_file='json:{"file.driver":"https",, "file.url":"https://user:password@vsphere.example.com/folder/test/test-flat.vmdk?dcPath=Datacenter&dsName=datastore1",, "file.sslverify":"off",, "file.readahead":"64k",, "file.timeout":10}' /tmp/test.qcow2

                   qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=/tmp/test.qcow2
