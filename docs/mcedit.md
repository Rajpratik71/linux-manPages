NAME
       mcedit - Internal file editor of GNU Midnight Commander.

USAGE
       mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] [+lineno] [file1] [file2] ...

       mcedit [-bcCdfhstVx?] file1:lineno[:] file2:lineno[:] ...

DESCRIPTION
       mcedit is a link to mc, the main GNU Midnight Commander executable. Executing GNU Midnight Commander under this name runs the internal edi‐
       tor and opens files specified on the command line. The editor is based on the terminal version of cooledit - standalone editor for X Window
       System.

OPTIONS
       +lineno
              Go to the line specified by number (do not put a space between the + sign and the number). Several line numbers are allowed but only
              the last one will be used, and it will be applied to the first file only.

       -b     Force black and white display.

       -c     Force ANSI color mode on terminals that don't seem to have color support.

       -C <keyword>=<fgcolor>,<bgcolor>,<attributes>:<keyword>= ...
              Specify a different color set.  See the Colors section in mc(1) for more information.

       -d     Disable mouse support.

       -f     Display the compiled-in search path for GNU Midnight Commander data files.

       -t     Force using termcap database instead of terminfo.  This option is only applicable if GNU Midnight Commander was compiled with S-Lang
              library with terminfo support.

       -V     Display the version of the program.

       -x     Force xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

FEATURES
       The  internal  file editor is a full-featured windowed editor.  It can edit several files at the same time. Maximum size of each file is 64
       megabytes. It is possible to edit binary files. The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key  for  key
       undo;  pull-down  menus; file insertion; macro commands; regular expression search and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported
       by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an option to  pipe
       text blocks through shell commands like indent and ispell.

       Each  file is opened in its own window in full-screen mode. Window control in mcedit is similar to the window control in other multi-window
       program: double click on window title maximizes the window to full-screen or restores window size and position; left-click on window  title
       and  mouse  drag moves the window in editor area; left-click on low-right frame corner and mouse drag resizes the window. These actions can
       be made using "Window" menu.

KEYS
       The editor is easy to use and can be used without learning.  The pull-down menu is invoked by pressing F9.  You can learn other  keys  from
       the menu and from the button bar labels.

       In  addition  to  that,  Shift  combined  with  arrows  does  text highlighting (if supported by the terminal): Ctrl-Ins copies to the file
       ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, Shift-Ins pastes from ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, Shift-Del cuts to ~/.cache/mc/mcedit/mcedit.clip, and
       Ctrl-Del  deletes  highlighted  text.  Mouse highlighting also works on some terminals.  To use the standard mouse support provided by your
       terminal, hold the Shift key.  Please note that the mouse support in the terminal doesn't share the clipboard with mcedit.

       The completion key (usually Meta-Tab or Escape Tab) completes the word under the cursor using the words used in the file.

MACRO
       To define a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the keys you want to be executed.  Press Ctrl-R again when finished.  The  macro  can  be
       assigned to any key by pressing that key.  The macro is executed when you press the assigned key.

       The macro commands are stored in section [editor] it the file ~/.local/share/mc/mc.macros.

       External scripts (filters) can be assigned into the any hotkey by edit mc.macros like following:

       [editor]
       ctrl-W=ExecuteScript:25;

       This  means  that  ctrl-W  hotkey  initiates  the  ExecuteScript(25)  action,  then  editor  handler  translates  this  into  execution  of
       ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/macro.25.sh shell script.

       External scripts are stored in ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/macros.d/ directory and must be named as macro.XXXX.sh where  XXXX  is  the  number
       from 0 to 9999.  See Edit Menu File for more detail about format of the script.

       Following macro definition and directives can be used:

       #silent
              If this directive is set, then script starts without interactive subshell.

       %c     The cursor column position number.

       %i     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column.

       %y     The syntax type of current file.

       %b     The block file name.

       %f     The current file name.

       %n     Only the current file name without extension.

       %x     The extension of current file name.

       %d     The current directory name.

       %F     The current file in the unselected panel.

       %D     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       %t     The currently tagged files.

       %T     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       %u and %U
              Similar  to  the  %t  and %T macros, but in addition the files are untagged. You can use this macro only once per menu file entry or
              extension file entry, because next time there will be no tagged files.

       %s and %S
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

       Feel free to edit this files, if you need.  Here is a sample external script:

       l       comment selection
            TMPFILE=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/up.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            echo #if 0 > $TMPFILE
            cat %b >> $TMPFILE
            echo #endif >> $TMPFILE
            cat $TMPFILE > %b
            rm -f $TMPFILE

       If some keys don't work, you can use Learn Keys in the Options menu.

CODE NAVIGATION
       mcedit can be used for navigation through code with tags files created by etags or ctags commands. If there is no TAGS file code navigation
       will not work.  For example, in case of exuberant-ctags for C language command will be:

       ctags -e --language-force=C -R ./

       Meta-Enter shows list box to select item under cursor (cursor should stand at the end of the word).

       Meta-Minus where minus is symbol "-" goes to previous function in navigation list (like browser's Back button).

       Meta-Equal where equal is symbol "=" goes to next function in navigation list (like browser's Forward button).

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
       mcedit  supports  syntax  highlighting.   This means that keywords and contexts (like C comments, string constants, etc) are highlighted in
       different colors.  The following section explains the format of the file ~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax.  If this file is missing,  system-wide
       /usr/share/mc/syntax/Syntax  is used.  The file ~/.config/mc/mcedit/Syntax is rescanned on opening of every new editor file.  The file con‐
       tains rules for highlighting, each of which is given on a separate line, and define which keywords will be highlighted with what color.

       The file is divided into sections, each beginning with a line with the file command.  The sections are normally  put  into  separate  files
       using the include command.

       The file command has three arguments.  The first argument is a regular expression that is applied to the file name to determine if the fol‐
       lowing section applies to the file.  The second argument is the description of the file type.  It is used in cooledit; future  versions  of
       mcedit  may use it as well.  The third optional argument is a regular expression to match the first line of text of the file.  The rules in
       the following section apply if either the file name or the first line of text matches.

       A section ends with the start of another section.  Each section is divided into contexts, and each context contains rules.  A context is  a
       scope  within the text that a particular set of rules belongs to.  For instance, the text within a C style comment (i.e. between /* and */)
       has its own color.  This is a context, although it has no further rules inside it because there is probably  nothing  that  we  want  high‐
       lighted within a C comment.

       A trivial C programming section might look like this:

       file .\*\\.c C\sProgram\sFile (#include|/\\\*)

       wholechars abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_

       # default colors
       define  comment   brown
       context default
         keyword  whole  if       yellow
         keyword  whole  else     yellow
         keyword  whole  for      yellow
         keyword  whole  while    yellow
         keyword  whole  do       yellow
         keyword  whole  switch   yellow
         keyword  whole  case     yellow
         keyword  whole  static   yellow
         keyword  whole  extern   yellow
         keyword         {        brightcyan
         keyword         }        brightcyan
         keyword         '*'      green

       # C comments
       context /\* \*/ comment

       # C preprocessor directives
       context linestart # \n red
         keyword  \\\n  brightred

       # C string constants
       context " " green
         keyword  %d    brightgreen
         keyword  %s    brightgreen
         keyword  %c    brightgreen
         keyword  \\"   brightgreen

       Each context starts with a line of the form:

       context [exclusive] [whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] delim [linestart] delim [foreground] [background] [attributes]

       The first context is an exception.  It must start with the command

       context default [foreground] [background] [attributes]

       otherwise  mcedit will report an error.  The linestart option specifies that delim must start at the beginning of a line.  The whole option
       tells that delim must be a whole word.  To specify that a word must begin on the word boundary only on the  left  side,  you  can  use  the
       wholeleft option, and similarly a word that must end on the word boundary is specified by wholeright.

       The set of characters that constitute a whole word can be changed at any point in the file with the wholechars command.  The left and right
       set of characters can be set separately with

       wholechars [left|right] characters

       The exclusive option causes the text between the delimiters to be highlighted, but not the delimiters themselves.

       Each rule is a line of the form:

       keyword [whole|wholeright|wholeleft] [linestart] string foreground [background] [attributes]

       Context or keyword strings are interpreted, so that you can include tabs and spaces with the sequences \t and \s.  Newlines and backslashes
       are  specified  with  \n and \\ respectively.  Since whitespace is used as a separator, it may not be used as is.  Also, \* must be used to
       specify an asterisk.  The * itself is a wildcard that matches any length of characters.  For example,

         keyword         '*'      green

       colors all C single character constants green.  You also could use

         keyword         "*"      green

       to color string constants, but the matched string would not be allowed to span across multiple newlines.  The wildcard may be  used  within
       context delimiters as well, but you cannot have a wildcard as the last or first character.

       Important to note is the line

         keyword  \\\n  brightgreen

       This line defines a keyword containing the backslash and newline characters.  Since the keywords are matched before the context delimiters,
       this keyword prevents the context from ending at the end of the lines that end in a backslash, thus allowing C  preprocessor  directive  to
       continue across multiple lines.

       The  possible  colors  are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan,
       brightcyan, lightgray and white. The special keyword "default" means the terminal's default. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main
       colors,  it is useful as a placeholder if you want to specify attributes without modifying the background color. When 256 colors are avail‐
       able, they can be specified either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23.

       If the syntax file is shared with cooledit, it is possible to specify different colors for mcedit and cooledit by separating  them  with  a
       slash, e.g.

       keyword  #include  red/Orange

       mcedit uses the color before the slash.  See cooledit(1) for supported cooledit colors.

       Attributes can be any of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than one are desired.

       Comments may be put on a separate line starting with the hash sign (#).

       If  you are describing case insensitive language you need to use caseinsensitive directive. It should be specified at the beginning of syn‐
       tax file.

       Because of the simplicity of the implementation, there are a few intricacies that will not be dealt with correctly but these  are  a  minor
       irritation.  On the whole, a broad spectrum of quite complicated situations are handled with these simple rules.  It is a good idea to take
       a look at the syntax file to see some of the nifty tricks you can do with a little imagination.  If you cannot get by with the rules I have
       coded,  and  you think you have a rule that would be useful, please email me with your request.  However, do not ask for regular expression
       support, because this is flatly impossible.

       A useful hint is to work with as much as possible with the things you can do rather than try to do things that this  implementation  cannot
       deal with.  Also remember that the aim of syntax highlighting is to make programming less prone to error, not to make code look pretty.

       The syntax highlighting can be toggled using Ctrl-s shortcut.

COLORS
       The  default  colors may be changed by appending to the MC_COLOR_TABLE environment variable.  Foreground and background colors pairs may be
       specified for example with:

       MC_COLOR_TABLE="$MC_COLOR_TABLE:\
       editnormal=lightgray,black:\
       editbold=yellow,black:\
       editmarked=black,cyan"

OPTIONS
       Most options can be set from Options dialog box.  See the Options menu.  The following options are defined  in  ~/.config/mc/ini  and  have
       obvious  counterparts  in  the  dialog box.  You can modify them to change the editor behavior, by editing the file.  Unless specified, a 1
       sets the option to on, and a 0 sets it to off, as usual.

       use_internal_edit
              This option is ignored when invoking mcedit.

       editor_tab_spacing
              Interpret the tab character as being of this length.  Default is 8. You should avoid using other than 8 since most other editors and
              text viewers assume a tab spacing of 8. Use editor_fake_half_tabs to simulate a smaller tab spacing.

       editor_fill_tabs_with_spaces
              Never insert a tab character. Rather insert spaces (ascii 32) to fill to the desired tab size.

       editor_return_does_auto_indent
              Pressing return will tab across to match the indentation of the first line above that has text on it.

       editor_backspace_through_tabs
              Make a single backspace delete all the space to the left margin if there is no text between the cursor and the left margin.

       editor_fake_half_tabs
              This  will emulate a half tab for those who want to program with a tab spacing of 4, but do not want the tab size changed from 8 (so
              that the code will be formatted the same when displayed by other programs). When editing between text and the  left  margin,  moving
              and  tabbing  will  be  as though a tab space were 4, while actually using spaces and normal tabs for an optimal fill.  When editing
              anywhere else, a normal tab is inserted.

       editor_option_save_mode
              Possible values 0, 1 and 2.  The save mode (see the options menu also) allows you to change the method of saving a file.  Quick save
              (0)  saves  the file immediately, truncating the disk file to zero length (i.e.  erasing it) and then writing the editor contents to
              the file.  This method is fast, but dangerous, since a system error during a file save will leave the file only  partially  written,
              possibly  rendering  the  data irretrievable.  When saving, the safe save (1) option enables creation of a temporary file into which
              the file contents are first written.  In the event of a problem, the original file is untouched.  When the temporary  file  is  suc‐
              cessfully  written,  it  is renamed to the name of the original file, thus replacing it.  The safest method is create backups (2): a
              backup file is created before any changes are made.  You can specify your own backup file extension in the dialog.  Note that saving
              twice will replace your backup as well as your original file.

       editor_word_wrap_line_length
              Line length to wrap at. Default is 72.

       editor_backup_extension
              Symbol to add to name of backup files. Default is "~".

       editor_line_state
              Show  state  line  of  editor. Currently it shows current line number (in the future it might show things like folding, breakpoints,
              etc.). M-n toggles this option.

       editor_visible_spaces
              Toggle "show visible trailing spaces".  If editor_visible_spaces=1, they are shown as '.'

       editor_visible_tabs
              Toggle "show visible tabs".  If editor_visible_tabs=1, tabs are shown as '<---->'

       editor_persistent_selections
              Do not remove block selection after cursor movement.

       editor_drop_selection_on_copy
              Reset selection after copy to clipboard.

       editor_cursor_beyond_eol
              Allow moving cursor beyond the end of line.

       editor_cursor_after_inserted_block
              Allow moving cursor after inserted block.

       editor_syntax_highlighting
              enable syntax highlighting.

       editor_edit_confirm_save
              Show confirmation dialog on save.

       editor_option_typewriter_wrap
              to be described

       editor_option_auto_para_formatting
              to be described

       editor_option_save_position
              Save file position on exit.

       source_codepage
              Symbol representation of codepage name for file (i.e. CP1251, ~ - default).

       editor_group_undo
              Combine UNDO actions for several of the same type of action (inserting/overwriting, deleting, navigating, typing)

       editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
              Search autocomplete candidates in entire file (1) or just from beginning of file to cursor position (0).

       spell_language
              Spelling language (en, en-variant_0, ru, etc) installed with aspell package (a full list can be obtained  using  'aspell'  utility).
              Use spell_language = NONE to disable aspell support. Default value is 'en'. Option must be located in the [Misc] section.

       editor_stop_format_chars
              Set of characters to stop paragraph formatting. If one of those characters is found in the beginning of line, that line and all fol‐
              lowing lines of paragraph will be untouched. Default value is "-+*\,.;:&>".

       editor_state_full_filename
              Show full path name in the status line. If disabled, only base name of the file is shown.

MISCELLANEOUS
       You can use scanf search and replace to search and replace a C format string.  First take a look at the sscanf and sprintf man pages to see
       what  a  format  string is and how it works.  Here's an example: suppose that you want to replace all occurrences of an open bracket, three
       comma separated numbers, and a close bracket, with the word apples, the third number, the word oranges and then  the  second  number.   You
       would fill in the Replace dialog box as follows:

       Enter search string
       (%d,%d,%d)
       Enter replace string
       apples %d oranges %d
       Enter replacement argument order
       3,2

       The last line specifies that the third and then the second number are to be used in place of the first and second.

       It  is  advisable  to  use  this feature with Prompt On Replace on, because a match is thought to be found whenever the number of arguments
       found matches the number given, which is not always a real match. Scanf also treats whitespace as being elastic.  Note that the scanf  for‐
       mat %[ is very useful for scanning strings, and whitespace.

       The  editor  also  displays non-us characters (160+).  When editing binary files, you should set display bits to 7 bits in Midnight Comman‐
       der's options menu to keep the spacing clean.
