NAME
       grokevt-findlogs - Attempts to find log file fragments in raw binary files, such as memory dumps and disk images.

SYNOPSIS
       grokevt-findlogs  -?   .PP grokevt-findlogs [-v] [-h] [-H] [-o offset] raw-file .SH DESCRIPTION grokevt-findlogs searches a raw binary file
       for event log records. It produces a simple comma-separated values (CSV) output to stdout which includes metadata and offsets of any  hits.
       Using the metadata and offset/contiguity information, it should be easy to determine if the hits are false positives or not.

ARGUMENTS
       raw-file
              The binary file to be searched.

OPTIONS
       -?     Prints a basic usage statement.

       -v     Verbose mode. Prints status messages to stderr, which can be helpful for debugging. (Currently does nothing.)

       -h     Prints a header row at the top of the CSV output containing labels for each column. (This is the default behavior.)

       -H     Disables the printing of a header row. This is useful when grokevt-findlogs is used in a script.

       -o offset
              Begin search at this byte offset within the binary file.

BUGS
       Probably a few. This script has not been extensively tested with some guest platforms.

       There are likely some speed improvements that could be made.
