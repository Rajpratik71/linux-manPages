NAME
       dpa - DNS Packet Analyzer. Analyze DNS packets in ip trace files

SYNOPSIS
       dpa [ OPTION ] TRACEFILE


DESCRIPTION
       dpa is used to analyze dns packets in trace files. It has 3 main options: count, filter, and count uniques (i.e. count all different occurences).


OPTIONS
       -c expressionlist
              Count occurrences of matching expressions


       -f expression
              Filter: only process packets that match the expression


       -h     Show usage


       -p     Show  the  total number of correct DNS packets, and percentage of -u and -c values  (of the total of matching on the -f filter. if no filter is given, percentages are on all correct dns pack‚Äê
              ets)


       -of file
              Write all packets that match the -f flag to file, as pcap data.


       -ofh file
              Write all packets that match the -f flag to file, in hexadecimal format, readable by drill.


       -s     Show possible match names


       -s matchname
              show possible match operators and values for name


       -sf    Only evaluate packets (in representation format) that match the -f filter.  If no -f was given, evaluate all correct dns packets.


       -u matchnamelist
              Count every occurence of every value of the matchname (for instance, count all packetsizes, see EXAMPLES in ldns-dpa(1) ).


       -ua    For every matchname in -u, show the average value of all matches. Behaviour for match types that do not have an integer value is undefined.


       -uac   For every matchname in -u, show the average number of times this value was encountered.


       -um number
              Only show the results from -u for values that occurred more than <number> times.


       -v level
              Set verbosity to level (1-5, 5 being the highest). Mostly used for debugging.


       -notip file
              Write packets that were not recognized as IP packets to file (as pcap data).


       -baddns file
              Write dns packets that were too mangled to parse to file (as pcap data).


       -version
              Show version and exit


LIST AND MATCHES
       A <matchnamelist> is a comma separated list of match names (use -s to see possible match names).  A <expressionlist> is a comma separated list of expressions.

       An expression has the following form: <expr>: (<expr>)
               <expr> | <expr>
               <expr> & <expr>
               <match>

       <match>:        <matchname> <operator> <value>

       <operator>:      =    equal to <value>      !=   not equal to <value>      >    greater than <value>      <    lesser than <value>      >=   greater than or equal to <value>      <=   lesser than or
       equal to <value>      ~=   contains <value>

       See the -s option for possible matchnames, operators and values.


EXAMPLES
       ldns-dpa -u packetsize -p test.tr
              Count all different packetsizes in test.tr and show the precentages.


       ldns-dpa -f "edns=1&qr=0" -of edns.tr test.tr
              Filter out all edns enable queries in test.tr and put them in edns.tr


       ldns-dpa -f edns=1 -c tc=1 -u rcode test.tr
              For all edns packets, count the number of truncated packets and all their rcodes in test.tr.


       ldns-dpa -c tc=1,qr=0,qr=1,opcode=QUERY test.tr
              For all packets, count the number of truncated packets, the number of packets with qr=0, the number of packets with qr=1 and the number of queries in test.tr.


       ldns-dpa -u packetsize -ua test.tr
              Show all packet sizes and the average packet size per packet.


       ldns-dpa -u srcaddress -uac test.tr
              Show all packet source addresses and the average number of packets sent from this address.


       sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s 0 -U -w - port 53 | ldns-dpa -f qr=0 -sf
              Print all query packets seen on the specified interface.
