NAME
       repo - tool for getting Android source

SYNOPSIS
       repo [ command ] [ options  ]

DESCRIPTION
       repo  is  a  repository management tool that we built on top of Git. repo unifies the many Git
       repositories when necessary, does the uploads to our revision control  system,  and  automates
       parts  of  the Android development workflow. repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it
       easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is  an  executable  Python
       script  that  you can put anywhere in your path. In working with the Android source files, you
       will use repo for across-network operations. For example, with a single repo command  you  can
       download files from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
