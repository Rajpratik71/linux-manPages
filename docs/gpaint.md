NAME
       gpaint - a small easy to use paint program for GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       gpaint [filename]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page briefly documents gpaint (GNU Paint), a small-scale painting program for GNOME, the GNU Desktop Environment. gpaint does
       not attempt to compete with GIMP, it is just a simple drawing package based on xpaint, along the lines of 'Paintbrush' from a popular  non-
       free operating system.

       gpaint is still work in progress and many features are still being developed. However, gpaint is usable and useful for simple image editing
       tasks.

FEATURES
       Currently gpaint has the following features:

       * Drawing tools such as ovals, freehand, polygon and text, with fill or shadow for polygons and closed freehand shapes.

       * Cut and paste by selecting irregular regions or polygons.

       * Preliminary print support using gnome-print.

       * Modern, easy to use user interface with tool and color palettes.

       * Multiple-image editing in a single instance of the program.

       * All the image processing features present in xpaint.

TODO
       Future plans include the implementation of zooming in/out, image scaling/rotation, and turning gpaint into a Bonobo  component  for  simple
       image editing tasks inside other programs.
