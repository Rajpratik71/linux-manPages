NAME
       virt-list-filesystems - List filesystems in a virtual machine or disk image

SYNOPSIS
        virt-list-filesystems [--options] domname

        virt-list-filesystems [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]

OBSOLETE
       This tool is obsolete.  Use virt-filesystems(1) as a more flexible replacement.

DESCRIPTION
       "virt-list-filesystems" is a command line tool to list the filesystems that are contained in a virtual machine or disk image.

       "virt-list-filesystems" is just a simple wrapper around libguestfs(3) functionality.  For more complex cases you should look at the guestfish(1) tool.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display brief help.

       --version
           Display version number and exit.

       -c URI
       --connect URI
           If using libvirt, connect to the given URI.  If omitted, then we connect to the default libvirt hypervisor.

           If you specify guest block devices directly, then libvirt is not used at all.

       --format raw
           Specify the format of disk images given on the command line.  If this is omitted then the format is autodetected from the content of the disk image.

           If disk images are requested from libvirt, then this program asks libvirt for this information.  In this case, the value of the format parameter is ignored.

           If working with untrusted raw-format guest disk images, you should ensure the format is always specified.

       -l
       --long
           With this option, "virt-list-filesystems" displays the type of each filesystem too (where "type" means "ext3", "xfs" etc.)

       -a
       --all
           Normally we only show mountable filesystems.  If this option is given then swap devices are shown too.
