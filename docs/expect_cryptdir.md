CRYPTDIR(1)                                                   General Commands Manual                                                  CRYPTDIR(1)

NAME
       cryptdir - encrypt/decrypt all files in a directory

SYNOPSIS
       cryptdir [ dir ]
       decryptdir [ dir ]

INTRODUCTION
       cryptdir encrypts all files in the current directory (or the given directory if one is provided as an argument).  When called as decryptdir
       (i.e., same program, different name), all files are decrypted.

NOTES
       When encrypting, you are prompted twice for the password as a precautionary measure.  It would be a disaster to encrypt files with a  pass‐
       word that wasn't what you intended.

       In contrast, when decrypting, you are only prompted once.  If it's the wrong password, no harm done.

       Encrypted  files  have the suffix .crypt appended.  This prevents files from being encrypted twice.  The suffix is removed upon decryption.
       Thus, you can easily add files to an encrypted directory and run cryptdir on it without worrying about the already encrypted files.

BUGS
       The man page is longer than the program.
