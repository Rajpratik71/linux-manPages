DESCRIPTION
       ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying them to the network layer.  ngrep is  a  pcap-aware  tool  that  will
       allow  you  to  specify  extended regular expressions to match against data payloads of packets.  It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP
       across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, FDDI and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common  packet  sniffing
       tools, such as tcpdump(8) and snoop(1).

OPTIONS
       -h     Display help/usage information.

       -N     Show sub-protocol number along with single-character identifier (useful when observing raw or unknown protocols).

       -X     Treat the match expression as a hexadecimal string.  See the explanation of match expression below.

       -V     Display version information.

       -i     Ignore case for the regex expression.

       -w     Match the regex expression as a word.

       -q     Be quiet; don't output any information other than packet headers and their payloads (if relevant).

       -p     Don't put the interface into promiscuous mode.

       -e     Show  empty packets.  Normally empty packets are discarded because they have no payload to search.  If specified, empty packets will
              be shown, regardless of the specified regex expression.

       -v     Invert the match; only display packets that don't match.

       -x     Dump packet contents as hexadecimal as well as ASCII.

       -l     Make stdout line buffered.

       -D     When reading pcap_dump files, replay them at their recorded time intervals (mimic realtime).

       -t     Print a timestamp in the form of YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.UUUUUU everytime a packet is matched.

       -T     Print a timestamp in the form of +S.UUUUUU, indicating the delta between packet matches.

       -R     Do not try to drop privileges to the DROPPRIVS_USER.

              ngrep makes no effort to validate input from live or offline sources as it is focused more on performance and handling large amounts
              of  data than protocol correctness, which is most often a fair assumption to make.  However, sometimes it matters and thus as a rule
              ngrep will try to be defensive and drop any root privileges it might have.

              There exist scenarios where this behaviour can become an obstacle, so this option is provided to end-users who want to disable  this
              feature,  but  must  do  so  with an understanding of the risks.  Packets can be randomly malformed or even specifically designed to
              overflow sniffers and take control of them, and revoking root privileges is currently the only risk mitigation ngrep employs against
              such an attack.  Use this option and turn it off at your own risk.

       -c cols
              Explicitly  set the console width to ``cols''.  Note that this is the console width, and not the full width of what ngrep prints out
              as payloads; depending on the output mode ngrep may print less than ``cols'' bytes per line (indentation).

       -F file
              Read in the bpf filter from the specified filename.  This is a compatibility option for users familiar with  tcpdump.   Please  note
              that specifying ``-F'' will override any bpf filter specified on the command-line.

       -P char
              Specify an alternate character to signify non-printable characters when displayed.  The default is ``.''.

       -W normal|byline|single|none
              Specify  an  alternate  manner for displaying packets, when not in hexadecimal mode.  The ``byline'' mode honors embedded linefeeds,
              wrapping text only when a linefeed is encountered (useful for observing HTTP transactions, for instance).  The ``none'' mode doesn't
              wrap  under  any  circumstance (entire payload is displayed on one line).  The ``single'' mode is conceptually the same as ``none'',
              except that everything including IP and source/destination header information is all on one line.  ``normal'' is  the  default  mode
              and is only included for completeness.  This option is incompatible with ``-x''.

       -s snaplen
              Set the bpf caplen to snaplen (default 65536).

       -S limitlen
              Set the upper limit on the size of packets that ngrep will look at.  Useful for looking at only the first N bytes of packets without
              changing the BPF snaplen.

       -I pcap_dump
              Input file pcap_dump into ngrep.  Works with any pcap-compatible dump file format.  This option is useful for searching for  a  wide
              range of different patterns over the same packet stream.

       -O pcap_dump
              Output matched packets to a pcap-compatible dump file.  This feature does not interfere with normal output to stdout.

       -n num Match only num packets total, then exit.

       -d dev By default ngrep will select a default interface to listen on.  Use this option to force ngrep to listen on interface dev.

       -A num Dump num packets of trailing context after matching a packet.

       -c cols
              Ignore the detected terminal width and force the column width to the specified size.

       -P char
              Change the non-printable character from the default ``.'' to the character specified.

       -K num Kill matching TCP connections (like tcpkill).  The numeric argument controls how many RST segments are sent.

        match expression
              A  match  expression  is  either an extended regular expression, or if the -X option is specified, a string signifying a hexadecimal
              value.  An extended regular expression follows the rules as implemented by the  GNU  regex  library.   Hexadecimal  expressions  can
              optionally be preceded by `0x'.  E.g., `DEADBEEF', `0xDEADBEEF'.

        bpf filter
              Selects  a filter that specifies what packets will be dumped.  If no bpf filter is given, all IP packets seen on the selected inter‐
              face will be dumped.  Otherwise, only packets for which bpf filter is `true' will be dumped.

       The bpf filter consists of one or more primitives.  Primitives usually consist of an id (name or number) preceded by  one  or  more  quali‐
       fiers.  There are three different kinds of qualifier:

       type   qualifiers say what kind of thing the id name or number refers to.  Possible types are host, net and port.  E.g., `host blort', `net
              1.2.3', `port 80'.  If there is no type qualifier, host is assumed.

       dir    qualifiers specify a particular transfer direction to and/or from id.  Possible directions are src, dst, src or dst and src and dst.
              E.g., `src foo', `dst net 1.2.3', `src or dst port ftp-data'.  If there is no dir qualifier, src or dst is assumed.  For `null' link
              layers (i.e. point to point protocols such as slip) the inbound and outbound qualifiers can be used to specify a desired direction.

       proto  qualifiers are restricted to ip-only protocols.  Possible protos are: tcp , udp and icmp.  e.g., `udp src foo' or `tcp port 21'.  If
              there  is  no  proto qualifier, all protocols consistent with the type are assumed.  E.g., `src foo' means `ip and ((tcp or udp) src
              foo)', `net bar' means `ip and (net bar)', and `port 53' means `ip and ((tcp or udp) port 53)'.

       In addition to the above, there are some special `primitive' keywords that don't follow the pattern: gateway, broadcast, less, greater  and
       arithmetic expressions.  All of these are described below.

       More  complex filter expressions are built up by using the words and, or and not to combine primitives.  E.g., `host blort and not port ftp
       and not port ftp-data'.  To save typing, identical qualifier lists can be omitted.  E.g., `tcp dst port  ftp  or  ftp-data  or  domain'  is
       exactly the same as `tcp dst port ftp or tcp dst port ftp-data or tcp dst port domain'.

       Allowable primitives are:

       dst host host
              True if the IP destination field of the packet is host, which may be either an address or a name.

       src host host
              True if the IP source field of the packet is host.

       host host
              True if either the IP source or destination of the packet is host.  Any of the above host expressions can be prepended with the key‐
              words, ip, arp, or rarp as in:
                   ip host host
              which is equivalent to:

       ether dst ehost
              True if the ethernet destination address is ehost.  Ehost may be either a name from /etc/ethers or  a  number  (see  ethers(3N)  for
              numeric format).

       ether src ehost
              True if the ethernet source address is ehost.

       ether host ehost
              True if either the ethernet source or destination address is ehost.

       gateway host
              True  if the packet used host as a gateway.  I.e., the ethernet source or destination address was host but neither the IP source nor
              the IP destination was host.  Host must be a name and must be found in both /etc/hosts and /etc/ethers.  (An  equivalent  expression
              is
                   ether host ehost and not host host
              which can be used with either names or numbers for host / ehost.)

       dst net net
              True  if the IP destination address of the packet has a network number of net. Net may be either a name from /etc/networks or a net‐
              work number (see networks(4) for details).

       src net net
              True if the IP source address of the packet has a network number of net.

       net net
              True if either the IP source or destination address of the packet has a network number of net.

       net net mask mask
              True if the IP address matches net with the specific netmask.  May be qualified with src or dst.

       net net/len
              True if the IP address matches net a netmask len bits wide.  May be qualified with src or dst.

       dst port port
              True if the packet is ip/tcp or ip/udp and has a destination port value of port.  The port can  be  a  number  or  a  name  used  in
              /etc/services  (see tcp(4P) and udp(4P)).  If a name is used, both the port number and protocol are checked.  If a number or ambigu‐
              ous name is used, only the port number is checked (e.g., dst port 513 will print both tcp/login traffic  and  udp/who  traffic,  and
              port domain will print both tcp/domain and udp/domain traffic).

       src port port
              True if the packet has a source port value of port.

       port port
              True  if  either  the source or destination port of the packet is port.  Any of the above port expressions can be prepended with the
              keywords, tcp or udp, as in:
                   tcp src port port
              which matches only tcp packets whose source port is port.

       less length
              True if the packet has a length less than or equal to length.  This is equivalent to:
                   len <= length.

       greater length
              True if the packet has a length greater than or equal to length.  This is equivalent to:
                   len >= length.

       ip proto protocol
              True if the packet is an ip packet (see ip(4P)) of protocol type protocol.  Protocol can be a number or one of the names tcp, udp or
              icmp.  Note that the identifiers tcp and udp are also keywords and must be escaped via backslash (\), which is \\ in the C-shell.

       ip broadcast
              True  if  the  packet is an IP broadcast packet.  It checks for both the all-zeroes and all-ones broadcast conventions, and looks up
              the local subnet mask.

       ip multicast
              True if the packet is an IP multicast packet.

       ip     Abbreviation for:
                   ether proto ip

       tcp, udp, icmp
              Abbreviations for:
                   ip proto p
              where p is one of the above protocols.

       expr relop expr
              True if the relation holds, where relop is one of >, <, >=, <=, =, !=, and expr is an arithmetic expression composed of integer con‐
              stants  (expressed in standard C syntax), the normal binary operators [+, -, *, /, &, |], a length operator, and special packet data
              accessors.  To access data inside the packet, use the following syntax:
                   proto [ expr : size ]
              Proto is one of ip, tcp, udp or icmp, and indicates the protocol layer for the index operation.  The byte offset,  relative  to  the
              indicated  protocol layer, is given by expr.  Size is optional and indicates the number of bytes in the field of interest; it can be
              either one, two, or four, and defaults to one.  The length operator, indicated by the keyword len, gives the length of the packet.

              For example, `ether[0] & 1 != 0' catches all multicast traffic.  The expression `ip[0] & 0xf !=  5'  catches  all  IP  packets  with
              options.  The  expression  `ip[6:2]  &  0x1fff = 0' catches only unfragmented datagrams and frag zero of fragmented datagrams.  This
              check is implicitly applied to the tcp and udp index operations.  For instance, tcp[0] always  means  the  first  byte  of  the  TCP
              header, and never means the first byte of an intervening fragment.

       Primitives may be combined using:

              A parenthesized group of primitives and operators (parentheses are special to the Shell and must be escaped).

              Negation (`!' or `not').

              Concatenation (`&&' or `and').

              Alternation (`||' or `or').

       Negation  has highest precedence.  Alternation and concatenation have equal precedence and associate left to right.  Note that explicit and
       tokens, not juxtaposition, are now required for concatenation.

       If an identifier is given without a keyword, the most recent keyword is assumed.  For example,
            not host vs and ace
       is short for
            not host vs and host ace
       which should not be confused with
            not ( host vs or ace )

       Expression arguments can be passed to ngrep as either a single argument or as multiple arguments, whichever is more convenient.  Generally,
       if the expression contains Shell metacharacters, it is easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument.  Multiple arguments are concatenated
       with spaces before being parsed.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Errors from ngrep, libpcap, and the GNU regex library are all output to stderr.
