NAME
       swift-ring-builder-analyzer - put the OpenStack Swift ring builder through its paces

SYNOPSIS
       swift-ring-builder-analyzer [options] scenario_path


DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  tool  to  help  developers  quantify  changes to the ring builder. It takes a scenario (JSON file) describing the builder's basic parameters (part_power, replicas, etc.) and a number of
       "rounds", where each round is a set of operations to perform on the builder. For each round, the operations are applied, and then the builder is rebalanced until it reaches a steady state.


OPTIONS
       scenario_path
              Path to the scenario file

       -h, --help
              Show this help message and exit

       --check, -c
              Just check the scenario, don't execute it.
