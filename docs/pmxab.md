NAME
       pmxab - a MusiXTeX preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       pmxab basename[.pmx]

DESCRIPTION
       pmxab  is  a preprocessor for MusiXTeX.  It's usually invoked by a frontend musixtex(1).  To use it to its full benefit you should have installed MusiXTeX Version 1.21 or higher,
       and TeX itself.  The goal of PMX is to faciliate the efficient typesetting of scores and parts that have an almost professional appearance. To learn more about  typesetting  with
       PMX, please read the PMX Manual.

       When invoked directly, pmxab produces tex output utilizing the MusiXTeX macro set.
