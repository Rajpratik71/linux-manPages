NAME
       recon-ng - Web Reconnaissance framework

SYNOPSIS
       recon-ng recon-ng [-h] [-v] [-w workspace] [-r filename] [--no-check] [--no-analytics]

DESCRIPTION
       Recon-ng  is  a  full-featured  Web  Reconnaissance framework written in Python. Complete with
       independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience functions,  interactive  help,
       and  command  completion,  Recon-ng  provides a powerful environment in which open source web-
       based reconnaissance can be conducted quickly and thoroughly.

       Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the learning  curve
       for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different. Recon-ng is not intended to com‐
       pete with existing frameworks, as it is designed exclusively for web-based open source  recon‐
       naissance.  If  you want to exploit, use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to social engi‐
       neer, use the Social-Engineer Toolkit.

       See the [Usage Guide](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng/wiki/Usage%20Guide) for  more
       information.
