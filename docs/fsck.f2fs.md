DESCRIPTION
       fsck.f2fs is used to check an f2fs file system (usually in a disk partition).  device  is  the
       special file corresponding to the device (e.g.  /dev/sdXX).

       The exit code returned by fsck.f2fs is 0 on success and -1 on failure.

              Enable  to  run file system check only if a bug was reported by the F2FS kernel module.

       -f enable force fix
              Enable to fix all the inconsistency in the partition.

       -p enable preen mode
