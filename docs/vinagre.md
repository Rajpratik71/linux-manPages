OPERANDS
       The following operands are supported:

       [server][::port|:display]
              Specifies the VNC server to connect to. The VNC server can be either a hostname, or an IP address. If the server is an IPv6 address,
              it must be enclosed by square brackets. The address can optionally be followed by two colons (::) and the VNC port number, or alter‚Äê
              natively by one colon (:) and the display where Vinagre should run. If a port is not specified, default value of 5900 will be  used.
              If  the value is lower than 1024, 5900 will be added to it. For example, ":0" means "5900" and ":1" means ":5901". If only a port is
              specified, but not the hostname, localhost will be assumed.  Possible values for the display are between 0 and 1024.  If  a  display
              number greater than 1024 is specified, it will be assumed to be a port.  Note that you can't specify the port and the display at the
              same time.
