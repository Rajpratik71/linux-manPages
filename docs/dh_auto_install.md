NAME
       dh_auto_install - automatically runs make install or similar

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_install [build system options] [debhelper options] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_install is a debhelper program that tries to automatically install built files. It does so by running the appropriate command for
       the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if there's a Makefile and it contains a install target, then this is done by
       running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is set). If there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it is used. Note that the Ant build system
       does not support installation, so dh_auto_install will not install files built using Ant.

       Unless --destdir option is specified, the files are installed into debian/package/ if there is only one binary package. In the multiple
       binary package case, the files are instead installed into debian/tmp/, and should be moved from there to the appropriate package build
       directory using dh_install(1).

       DESTDIR is used to tell make where to install the files.  If the Makefile was generated by MakeMaker from a Makefile.PL, it will
       automatically set PREFIX=/usr too, since such Makefiles need that.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work, or tries to use the wrong install target, you're encouraged to skip
       using dh_auto_install at all, and just run make install manually.

OPTIONS
       See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common build system selection and control options.

       --destdir=directory
           Install files into the specified directory. If this option is not specified, destination directory is determined automatically as
           described in the "DESCRIPTION" section.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that dh_auto_install usually passes.
