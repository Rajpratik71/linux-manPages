NAME
       ipa-getkeytab - Get a keytab for a Kerberos principal

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-getkeytab  -p  principal-name  -k keytab-file [ -e encryption-types ] [ -s ipaserver ] [ -q ] [ -D|--binddn BINDDN ] [ -w|--bindpw ] [ -P|--password PASSWORD ] [ --cacert CACERT ] [ -H|--ldapuri
       URI ] [ -Y|--mech GSSAPI|EXTERNAL ] [ -r ]


DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a Kerberos keytab.

       Kerberos keytabs are used for services (like sshd) to perform Kerberos authentication. A keytab is a file with one or more secrets (or keys) for a Kerberos principal.

       A Kerberos service principal is a Kerberos identity that can be used for authentication. Service principals contain the name of the service, the hostname of the server, and the realm name. For exam‚Äê
       ple, the following is an example principal for an ldap server:

          ldap/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM

       When using ipa-getkeytab the realm name is already provided, so the principal name is just the service name and hostname (ldap/foo.example.com from the example above).

       ipa-getkeytab  is  used  during IPA client enrollment to retrieve a host service principal and store it in /etc/krb5.keytab. It is possible to retrieve the keytab without Kerberos credentials if the
       host was pre-created with a one-time password. The keytab can be retrieved by binding as the host and authenticating with this one-time password. The -D|--binddn and -w|--bindpw options are used for
       this authentication.

       WARNING:  retrieving  the keytab resets the secret for the Kerberos principal.  This renders all other keytabs for that principal invalid.  When multiple hosts or services need to share the same key
       (for instance in high availability or load balancing clusters), the -r option must be used to retrieve the existing key instead of generating a new one (please refer to the EXAMPLES section).

       Note that the user or host calling ipa-getkeytab needs to be allowed to generate the key with ipa host-allow-create-keytab or ipa service-allow-create-keytab, and  the  user  or  host  calling  ipa-
       getkeytab -r needs to be allowed to retrieve the keytab for the host or service with ipa host-allow-retrieve-keytab or ipa service-allow-retrieve-keytab.


OPTIONS
       -p principal-name
              The non-realm part of the full principal name.

       -k keytab-file
              The keytab file where to append the new key (will be created if it does not exist).

       -e encryption-types
              The  list  of  encryption types to use to generate keys.  ipa-getkeytab will use local client defaults if not provided.  Valid values depend on the Kerberos library version and configuration.
              Common values are: aes256-cts aes128-cts des3-hmac-sha1 arcfour-hmac des-hmac-sha1 des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc

       -s ipaserver
              The IPA server to retrieve the keytab from (FQDN). If this option is not provided the server name is read from the IPA configuration file (/etc/ipa/default.conf). Cannot be used together with
              -H.

       -q     Quiet mode. Only errors are displayed.

       --permitted-enctypes
              This  options  returns  a description of the permitted encryption types, like this: Supported encryption types: AES-256 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC AES-128 CTS mode with 96-bit SHA-1 HMAC
              Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 ArcFour with HMAC/md5 DES cbc mode with CRC-32 DES cbc mode with RSA-MD5 DES cbc mode with RSA-MD4

       -P, --password
              Use this password for the key instead of one randomly generated.

       -D, --binddn
              The LDAP DN to bind as when retrieving a keytab without Kerberos credentials. Generally used with the -w option.

       -w, --bindpw
              The LDAP password to use when not binding with Kerberos. -D and -w can not be used together with -Y.

       --cacert
              The path to the IPA CA certificate used to validate LDAPS/STARTTLS connections.  Defaults to /etc/ipa/ca.crt

       -H, --ldapuri
              LDAP URI. If ldap:// is specified, STARTTLS is initiated by default. Can not be used with -s.

       -Y, --mech
              SASL mechanism to use if -D and -w are not specified. Use either GSSAPI or EXTERNAL.

       -r     Retrieve mode. Retrieve an existing key from the server instead of generating a new one. This is incompatibile with the --password option, and will work only against a IPA server more  recent
              than version 3.3. The user requesting the keytab must have access to the keys for this operation to succeed.

EXAMPLES
       Add and retrieve a keytab for the NFS service principal on the host foo.example.com and save it in the file /tmp/nfs.keytab and retrieve just the des-cbc-crc key.

          # ipa-getkeytab -p nfs/foo.example.com -k /tmp/nfs.keytab -e des-cbc-crc

       Add and retrieve a keytab for the ldap service principal on the host foo.example.com and save it in the file /tmp/ldap.keytab.

          # ipa-getkeytab -s ipaserver.example.com -p ldap/foo.example.com -k /tmp/ldap.keytab

       Retrieve a keytab using LDAP credentials (this will typically be done by ipa-join(1) when enrolling a client using the ipa-client-install(1) command:

          # ipa-getkeytab -s ipaserver.example.com -p host/foo.example.com -k /etc/krb5.keytab -D fqdn=foo.example.com,cn=computers,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com -w password

       Add and retrieve a keytab for a clustered HTTP service deployed on client1.example.com and client2.example.com (already enrolled), using the client-frontend.example.com host name:

          # ipa host-add client-frontend.example.com --ip-address 10.1.2.3
          # ipa service-add HTTP/client-frontend.example.com
          # ipa service-allow-retrieve-keytab HTTP/client-frontend.example.com --hosts={client1.example.com,client2.example.com}
          # ipa server-allow-create-keytab HTTP/client-frontend.example.com --hosts=client1.example.com

          On client1, generate and retrieve a new keytab for client-frontend.example.com:
          # kinit -k
          # ipa-getkeytab -p HTTP/client-frontend.example.com -k /tmp/http.keytab

          On client2, retrieve the existing keytab for client-frontend.example.com:
          # kinit -k
          # ipa-getkeytab -r -p HTTP/client-frontend.example.com -k /tmp/http.keytab
