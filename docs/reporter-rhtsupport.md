NAME
       reporter-rhtsupport - Reports problem to RHTSupport.

SYNOPSIS
       reporter-rhtsupport [-v] [-c CONFFILE] [-F FMTFILE] [-u -C UR_CONFFILE] -d DIR

       Or:

       reporter-rhtsupport [-v] [-c CONFFILE] [-d DIR] -t[ID] FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       The tool reads problem directory DIR. Then it logs in to RHTSupport and creates a new case.

       The tool can be configured to submit an uReport to RHTSupport together with creating a new case.

       The URL to new case is printed to stdout and recorded in reported_to element in DIR.

       If not specified, CONFFILE defaults to /etc/libreport/plugins/rhtsupport.conf.

       Option -t uploads FILEs to the already created case on RHTSupport site. The case ID is retrieved from directory specified by -d DIR. If problem data in DIR was never reported to RHTSupport, you will
       be asked to enter case ID to which you want to upload the FILEs.

       Option -tCASE uploads FILEs to the case CASE on RHTSupport site. -d DIR is ignored.

       Option -u uploads uReport along with creating a new case. uReport configuration is loaded from UR_CONFFILE which defaults to /etc/libreport/plugins/ureport.conf.
