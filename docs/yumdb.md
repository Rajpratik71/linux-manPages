NAME
       yumdb - query and alter the Yum database

SYNOPSIS
       yumdb [command] [packages ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command is used to query and alter the yum database, which is a simple key value store used in conjunction with the rpm database. Any installed package can have arbitrary data in the yum data‚Äê
       base, however the main use case is to store extra data about packages as they are installed.

       yumdb commands are:

       yumdb get <key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will get the value for the given key, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb set <key> <value> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will set the value for the given key, to the given value, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb del <key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will delete the given key, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb rename <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will rename the given old-key, to the given new-key, limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist, nothing happens.

       yumdb rename-force <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will rename the given old-key, to the given new-key, limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist, new-key is deleted.

       yumdb copy <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will copy the given old-key, to the given new-key, limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist, nothing happens.

       yumdb copy-force <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will copy the given old-key, to the given new-key, limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist, new-key is deleted.

       yumdb search <key> <wildcard>...

       This command will search all packages for the given key, against any of the given wildcard values.

       yumdb exist <key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will print any packages which have the given key, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb unset <key> [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will print any packages which do not have the given key, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb info [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will display all the data stored in the yumdb, limiting to any specified packages.

       yumdb sync [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will add any missing data to the yumdb from the repositories, limiting to any specified packages. This is useful to run if you have had any aborted transactions (and thus. missing yumdb
       data).  Note that "yumdb sync" cannot know all the information that would have been put into the yumdb at the time.

       yumdb sync-force [pkg-wildcard]...

       This command will replace any data in the yumdb from the repositories, limiting to any specified packages.


EXAMPLES
       List all the packages which don't have a from_repo key/value:

              yumdb unset from_repo

       List all the packages which were installed as dependencies:

              yumdb search reason dep


WELL KNOWN KEYS
       Note that there is no limit to the number of keys that can be created or what they may contain (for installed packages only). However this is a list of well known keys, and what they store.

       checksum_data

       checksum_type

       These keys store the createrepo checksum, and it's type, of the available
       package yum installed. Note that these are used by "yum version" to calculate
       the rpmdb version.

       command_line

       This key stores the entire command line, of the yum command (if it was called).

       from_repo

       from_repo_revision

       from_repo_timestamp

       These keys take values from the available package yum installed, and store the
       repo id, it's revision and timestamp.

       reason

       This key stores either "user" or "dep", currently. To mark if the user requested
       the package to be installed, or if it was brought in automatically as a
       dependency. Note that this is kept over updates.

       releasever

       This key stores the value of releasever, when the package was installed.

       installonly

       If this attribute has the value "keep" then this package will not be
       removed automatically by the installonly process (and does not count towards
       the installonly_limit).
