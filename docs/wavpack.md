NAME
       wavpack - encode wav files to wavpack

SYNOPSIS
       wavpack [-options] INFILE... [-o OUTFILE]

DESCRIPTION
       wavpack encodes wav files containing uncompressed audio (or raw PCM data) into WavPack files using the options provided. The resulting filename will be source-name.wv unless overridden with the -o
       switch. Multiple input files may be specified resulting in multiple WavPack files, and in that case -o may be used to specify an alternate target directory.  Stdin and stdout may be specified with
       “-”. To decode WavPack files back to wav or raw PCM use the wvunpack program.

OPTIONS
       -a
           Adobe Audition (CoolEdit) mode for 32-bit floats

       -bn
           enable hybrid compression, n = 2.0 to 23.9 bits/sample, or n = 24-9600 kbits/second (kbps)

       --blocksize=n
           specify block size in samples (max = 131072 and min = 16 with --merge-blocks, otherwise 128)

       -c
           create correction file (.wvc) for hybrid mode (results in 2-file lossless compression)

       -cc
           maximum hybrid compression (hurts lossy quality & decode speed)

       --channel-order=list
           specify (comma separated) channel order if not Microsoft standard (which is FL,FR,FC,LFE,BL,BR,LC,FRC,BC,SL,SR,TC,TFL,TFC,TFR,TBL,TBC,TBR); specify “...”  to indicate that channels are not
           assigned to specific speakers, or terminate list with “...”  to indicate that any channels beyond those specified are unassigned

       -d
           delete source file if successful (use with caution!)

       -f
           fast mode (fast, but some compromise in compression ratio)

       -h
           high quality (better compression ratio, but slower encode and decode than default mode)

       -hh
           very high quality (best compression, but slowest and NOT recommended for use on portable playback devices)

       --help
           display extended help

       -i
           ignore length in wav header (no pipe output allowed)

       -jn
           joint-stereo override (0 = left/right, 1 = mid/side)

       -m
           compute & store MD5 signature of raw audio data

       --merge-blocks
           merge consecutive blocks with equal redundancy (used with --blocksize option and is useful for files generated by the lossyWAV program or decoded HDCD files)

       -n
           calculate average and peak quantization noise (hybrid only, reference fullscale sine)

       --no-utf8-convert
           don´t recode passed tags from local encoding to UTF-8, assume they are in UTF-8 already

       -o OUTFILE
           specify output filename (only if single source file) or target directory (must exist)

       --optimize-mono
           optimization for stereo files that are really mono (result may be incompatible with very old decoders)

       --pair-unassigned-chans
           encode unassigned channels into stereo pairs

       -p
           practical float storage (also 32-bit ints, not lossless)

       -q
           quiet (keep console output to a minimum)

       -r
           generate a new RIFF WAV header (any extra RIFF info in original file will be discarded)

       --raw-pcm
           intput data is raw pcm (44,100 Hz, 16-bit, 2-channels)

       --raw-pcm=sr,bits,chans
           intput data is raw pcm with specified sample-rate, bit-depth, and number of channels (specify 32f for 32-bit floating point data)

       -sn
           override default hybrid mode noise shaping where n is a float value between -1.0 and 1.0; negative values move noise lower in freq, positive values move noise higher in freq, use 0 for no
           shaping (white noise)

       -t
           copy input file´s time stamp to output file(s)

       --use-dns
           force use of dynamic noise shaping (hybrid mode only)

       -w “Field=Value”
           write specified text metadata to APEv2 tag

       -w “Field=@file.ext”
           write specified text metadata from file to APEv2 tag, normally used for embedded cuesheets and logs (field names “Cuesheet” and “Log”)

       --write-binary-tag “Field=@file.ext”
           write the specified binary metadata file to APEv2 tag, normally used for cover art with the specified field name “Cover Art (Front)”

       -x[n]
           extra encode processing (optional n = 1 to 6, 1=default), -x1 to -x3 to choose best of predefined filters, -x4 to -x6 to generate custom filters (very slow!)

       -y
           yes to all warnings (use with caution!)
