NAME
       valkyrie - graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools for debugging and profiling Linux executables

SYNOPSIS
       valkyrie [valkyrie-opts] [valgrind-opts] [prog-and-args]

DESCRIPTION
       Valkyrie  is  a  graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools for debugging and profiling Linux executables. The current version sup‚Äê
       ports Valgrind from version 3.4.0. Currently, the only supported Valgrind tool is Memcheck.  Valkyrie  uses  the  Qt  widget  library,  and
       should  run  on  most  reasonably recent Linux setups. The only sine qua non is that you must have: Qt v.3.2.0 or higher (but not Qt v.4 as
       yet), and Valgrind v.3.4.0 or higher.
