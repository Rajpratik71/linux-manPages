       -P file, --printwd=file
              Print  the  last  working directory to the specified file.  This option is not meant to be used directly.  Instead, it's used from a
              special shell script that automatically changes the current directory of the shell to the last directory Midnight Commander was  in.
              Source  the file /usr/lib/mc/mc.sh (bash and zsh users) or /usr/lib/mc.csh (tcsh users) respectively to define mc as an alias to the
              appropriate shell script.

       -s, --slow
              Set alternative mode drawing of frameworks.  If the section [Lines] is not filled, the symbol for  the  pseudographics  frame  is  a
              space, otherwise the frame characters are taken from following parameters.

              You can redefine the following variables:

       lefttop
              left-top corner

       righttop
              right-top corner

       centertop
              center-top cross

       centerbottom
              center-bottom cross

              left-middle cross

       rightmiddle
              right-middle cross

       centermiddle
              center cross

       horiz  default horizontal line

       vert   default vertical line

       thinhoriz
              thin horizontal line

       thinvert
              thin vertical line

       -S arg, --skin=arg
              Specify a name of skin in the command line. Technology of skins is documented in the Skins section.

       -t, --termcap
              Used  only  if  the code was compiled with Slang and terminfo: it makes Midnight Commander use the value of the TERMCAP variable for
              the terminal information instead of the information on the system wide terminal database

       -u, --nosubshell
              Disable use of the concurrent shell (only makes sense if Midnight Commander has been built with concurrent shell support).

       -U, --subshell
              Enable use of the concurrent shell support (only makes sense if the Midnight Commander was built with the subshell support set as an
              optional feature).

       -v file, --view=file
              Start the internal viewer to view the specified file.  See also mcview (1).

       -V, --version
              Display the version of the program.

       -x, --xterm
              Force xterm mode.  Used when running on xterm-capable terminals (two screen modes, and able to send mouse escape sequences).

       -X, --no-x11
              Do not use X11 to get the state of modifiers Alt, Ctrl, Shift

       If  both paths are specified, the first path name is the directory to show in the active panel; the second path name is the directory to be
       shown in the other panel.

       If one path is specified, the path name is the directory to show in the active panel; value of "other_dir" from panels.ini is the directory
       to be shown in the passive panel.

       If  no  paths  are  specified,  current directory is shown in the active panel; value of "other_dir" from panels.ini is the directory to be
       shown in the passive panel.

Overview
       The screen of Midnight Commander is divided into four parts.  Almost all of the screen space is taken  up  by  two  directory  panels.   By
       default,  the  second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels.  The
       topmost line is the menu bar line.  The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or press
       the F9 key.

       Midnight  Commander  provides a view of two directories at the same time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the
       current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the  direc‐
       tory of the unselected panel as a destination (don't worry, they always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the sec‐
       tions on the Directory Panels, the Left and Right Menus and the File Menu.

       You can execute system commands from Midnight Commander by simply typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell  command  line,
       and  when you press Enter, Midnight Commander will execute the command line you typed; read the Shell Command Line and Input Line Keys sec‐
       tions to learn more about the command line.

Mouse Support
       Midnight Commander comes with mouse support. It is activated whenever you are running on an xterm(1) terminal (it even works if you take  a
       telnet,  ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux console and have the gpm mouse server
       running.

       When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click with the right button, the file  is  marked  (or
       unmarked, depending on the previous state).

       Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an executable program; and if the extension file has a program specified
       for the file's extension, the specified program is executed.

       Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking on them.

       The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the ~/.config/mc/ini
       file and changing the mouse_repeat_rate parameter.

       If  you are running Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding
       down the Shift key.

Keys
       Some commands in Midnight Commander involve the use of the Control (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the Meta (sometimes labeled  ALT  or
       even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbreviations:

       C-<chr>
              means hold the Control key while typing the character <chr>.  Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f.

       Alt-<chr>
              means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing <chr>.  If there is no Meta or Alt key, type ESC, release it, then type the charac‐
              ter <chr>.

       S-<chr>
              means hold the Shift key down while typing <chr>.

       All input lines in Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU Emacs editor's key bindings (default).

       You may redefine key bindings. See redefine hotkey bindings

       for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) are relative to default behavior.

       There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the most important.

       The File Menu section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the File menu.  This  section  includes  the  function
       keys. Most of these commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the tagged files.

       The  Directory Panels section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one
       from the file menu).

       The Shell Command Line section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and  such
       from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the command line history.

       Input Line Keys are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and the input lines in the query dialogs.

  Redefine hotkey bindings
       Hotkey  bindings  may be read from external file (keymap-file).  Initially, Midnight Commander creates key bindings using keymap defined in
       the source code. Then, two files /usr/share/mc/mc.keymap and /etc/mc/mc.keymap are loaded  always,  sequentially  reassigned  key  bindings
       defined earlier.  User-defined keymap-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

              1) command line option -K <keymap> or --keymap=<keymap>
              2) Environment variable MC_KEYMAP
              3) Parameter keymap in section [Midnight-Commander] of config file.
              4) File ~/.config/mc/mc.keymap

       Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the keymap-file (with the extension
       .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first one found):

              1) ~/.config/mc
              2) /etc/mc/
              3) /usr/share/mc/

  Miscellaneous Keys
       Here are some keys which don't fall into any of the other categories:

       Enter  if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then that command is executed. If there is no  text
              in  the  command line then if the selection bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander does a chdir(2) to the selected directory
              and reloads the information on the panel; if the selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally, if the  extension  of
              the selected file name matches one of the extensions in the extensions file then the corresponding command is executed.

       C-l    repaint all the information in Midnight Commander.

       C-x c  run the Chmod command on a file or on the tagged files.

       C-x o  run the Chown command on the current file or on the tagged files.

       C-x l  run the hard link command.

       C-x s  run the absolute symbolic link command.

       C-x v  run the relative symbolic link command. See the File Menu section for more information about symbolic links.

       C-x i  set the other panel display mode to information.

       C-x q  set the other panel display mode to quick view.

       C-x !  execute the External panelize command.

       C-x h  run the add directory to hotlist command.

       Alt-!  executes the Filtered view command, described in the view command.

       Alt-?  executes the Find file command.

       Alt-c  pops up the quick cd dialog.

       C-o    when  the  program  is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it will show you the output of the previous com‐
              mand.  When ran on the Linux console, Midnight Commander uses an external program (cons.saver) to handle  saving  and  restoring  of
              information on the screen.

       When  the  subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o at any time and you will be taken back to Midnight Commander's main screen, to
       return to your application just type C-o.  If you have an application suspended by using this trick, you won't be  able  to  execute  other
       programs from Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended application.

  Directory Panels
       This  section  lists  the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a
       look at the section on Left and Right Menus.

       Tab, C-i
              change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new current panel and the old current panel becomes the new  other  panel.
              The selection bar moves from the old current panel to the new current panel.

       Insert, C-t
              to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence).  To untag files, just retag a tagged file.

       M-e    to  change  charset  of  panel you may use M-e (Alt-e).  Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the
              recoding you may select "directory up" (..) in active panel.  To cancel the charsets in all directories, select "No translation " in
              the dialog of encodings.

       Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j
              used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively.

       Alt-t  toggle the current display listing to show the next display listing mode.  With this it is possible to quickly switch to brief list‐
              ing, long listing, user defined listing mode, and back to the default.

       C-\ (control-backslash)
              show the directory hotlist and change to the selected directory.

       +  (plus)
              this is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When Files only  checkbox  is
              on,  only  files will be selected.  If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected.  When Shell Patterns checkbox is
              on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters  and  ?  standing
              for  one  character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When
              Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters.  If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

       \ (backslash)
              use the "\" key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Plus key.

       up-key, C-p
              move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel.

       down-key, C-n
              move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel.

       home, a1, Alt-<
              move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel.

       end, c1, Alt->
              move the selection bar to the last entry in the panel.

       next-page, C-v
              move the selection bar one page down.

       prev-page, Alt-v
              move the selection bar one page up.

       Alt-o  If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next  file.  If
              the  currently  selected  file  is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next
              file.

       Alt-i  make the current directory of the current panel also the current directory of the other panel.  Put the other panel to  the  listing
              mode if needed.  If the current panel is panelized, the other panel doesn't become panelized.

       C-PageUp, C-PageDown
              only when supported by the terminal: change to ".." and to the currently selected directory respectively.

       Alt-y  moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the < with the mouse.

       Alt-u  moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the > with the mouse.

       Alt-Shift-h, Alt-H
              displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the 'v' with the mouse.

  Quick search
       The Quick search mode allows you to perform fast file search in file panel.  Press C-s or Alt-s to start a filename search in the directory
       listing.

       When the search is active, the user input will be added to the search string instead of the command line. If the Show mini-status option is
       enabled  the  search  string  is shown on the mini-status line. When typing, the selection bar will move to the next file starting with the
       typed letters. The Backspace or DEL keys can be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for.

       If quick search is started with double pressing of C-s, the previous quick search pattern will be used for current search.

       Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters '*' and '?'.

  Shell Command Line
       This section lists keys which are useful to avoid excessive typing when entering shell commands.

       Alt-Enter
              copy the currently selected file name to the command line.

       C-Enter
              same a Alt-Enter.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

       C-Shift-Enter
              copy the full path name of the currently selected file to the command line.  May not work on remote systems and some terminals.

       Alt-Tab
              does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completion for you.

       C-x t, C-x C-t
              copy the tagged files (or if there are no tagged files, the selected file) of the current panel (C-x t) or of the other  panel  (C-x
              C-t) to the command line.

       C-x p, C-x C-p
              the  first key sequence copies the current path name to the command line, and the second one copies the unselected panel's path name
              to the command line.

       C-q    the quote command can be used to insert characters that are otherwise interpreted by Midnight Commander (like the '+' symbol)

       Alt-p, Alt-n
              use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

       Alt-h  displays the history for the current input line.

  General Movement Keys
       The help viewer, the file viewer and the directory tree use common code to handle moving. Therefore they accept exactly the same keys. Each
       of them also accepts some keys of its own.

       Other parts of Midnight Commander use some of the same movement keys, so this section may be of use for those parts too.

       Up, C-p
              moves one line backward.

       Down, C-n
              moves one line forward.

       Prev Page, Page Up, Alt-v
              moves one page up.

       Next Page, Page Down, C-v
              moves one page down.

       Home, A1
              moves to the beginning.

       End, C1
              move to the end.

       The help viewer and the file viewer accept the following keys in addition the to ones mentioned above:

       b, C-b, C-h, Backspace, Delete
              moves one page up.

       Space bar
              moves one page down.

       u, d   moves one half of a page up or down.

       g, G   moves to the beginning or to the end.

  Input Line Keys
       The input lines (they are used for the command line and for the query dialogs in the program) accept these keys:

       C-a    puts the cursor at the beginning of line.

       C-e    puts the cursor at the end of the line.

       C-b, move-left
              move the cursor one position left.

       C-f, move-right
              move the cursor one position right.

       Alt-f  moves one word forward.

       Alt-b  moves one word backward.

       C-h, Backspace
              delete the previous character.

       C-d, Delete
              delete the character in the point (over the cursor).

       C-@    sets the mark for cutting.

       C-w    copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer and removes the text from the input line.

       Alt-w  copies the text between the cursor and the mark to a kill buffer.

       C-y    yanks back the contents of the kill buffer.

       C-k    kills the text from the cursor to the end of the line.

       Alt-p, Alt-n
              Use these keys to browse through the command history. Alt-p takes you to the last entry, Alt-n takes you to the next one.

       Alt-C-h, Alt-Backspace
              delete one word backward.

       Alt-Tab
              does the filename, command, variable, username and hostname completion for you.

Menu Bar
       The  menu bar pops up when you press F9 or click the mouse on the top row of the screen. The menu bar has five menus: "Left", "File", "Com‐
       mand", "Options" and "Right".

       The Left and Right Menus allow you to modify the appearance of the left and right directory panels.

       The File Menu lists the actions you can perform on the currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The Command Menu lists the actions which are more general and bear no relation to the currently selected file or the tagged files.

       The Options Menu lists the actions which allow you to customize Midnight Commander.

  Left and Right (Above and Below) Menus
       The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the Left and Right menus (they are named Above and Below when the horizontal  panel
       split is chosen from the Layout options dialog).

    Listing Mode...
       The  listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are four different listing modes available: Full, Brief, Long and User.
       The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the modification time.

       The brief view shows only the file name and it has from 1 up to 9 columns (therefore showing more files unlike other views). The long  view
       is similar to the output of ls -l command. The long view takes the whole screen width.

       If you choose the "User" display format, then you have to specify the display format.

       The  user  display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may be "half" or "full", and they specify a half screen panel and a
       full screen panel respectively.

       After the panel size, you may specify the two columns mode on the panel, this is done by adding the number "2" to the user format string.

       After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier.  This are the available fields you may display:

       name   displays the file name.

       size   displays the file size.

       bsize  is an alternative form of the size format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR.

       type   displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - * for  executable
              files,  /  for  directories,  @  for links, = for sockets, - for character devices, + for block devices, | for pipes, ~ for symbolic
              links to directories and !  for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere).

       mark   an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it's not.

       mtime  file's last modification time.

       atime  file's last access time.

       ctime  file's status change time.

       perm   a string representing the current permission bits of the file.

       mode   an octal value with the current permission bits of the file.

       nlink  the number of links to the file.

       ngid   the GID (numeric).

       nuid   the UID (numeric).

       owner  the owner of the file.

       group  the group of the file.

       inode  the inode of the file.

       Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout:

       space  a space in the display format.

       |      add a vertical line to the display format.

       To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add : followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.   If
       the  number is followed by the symbol +, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more space
       on the screen, it will then expand that field.

       For example, the Full display corresponds to this format:

       half type name | size | mtime

       And the Long display corresponds to this format:

       full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name

       This is a nice user display format:

       half name | size:7 | type mode:3

       Panels may also be set to the following modes:

       Info   The info view display information related to the currently selected file and if possible information about the current file system.

       Tree   The tree view is quite similar to the directory tree feature. See the section about it for more information.

       Quick View
              In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced viewer that displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you select the
              panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer commands.

    Sort Order...
       The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time, by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size,
       by inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in  reverse
       order by checking the reverse box.

       By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed from the Panel options menu (option Mix all files).

    Filter...
       The  filter  command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example *.tar.gz) which the files must match to be shown. Regardless of the
       filter pattern, the directories and the links to directories are always shown in the directory panel.

    Reread
       The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is useful if other processes have created or removed files.

  File Menu
       Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for commands appearing in the file menu.   The  escape  sequences  for  the
       function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality
       by pressing the ESC key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively).

       The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses):

       Help (F1)

       Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the help viewer, you can use the Tab key to select the next link and the  Enter  key  to
       follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move forward and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of
       accepted keys.

       Menu (F2)

       Invoke the user menu.  The user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and add extra features to Midnight Commander.

       View (F3, F13)

       View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the Internal File Viewer but if the option "Use internal view" is off, it invokes
       an external file viewer specified by the VIEWER environment variable.  If VIEWER is undefined, the PAGER environment variable is tried.  If
       PAGER is also undefined, the "view" command is invoked.  If you use F13 instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or
       preprocessing to the file.

       See parameters for external viewer for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external viewers.

       Filtered View (Alt-!)

       This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected file name), the output from such com‐
       mand is shown in the internal file viewer.

       Edit (F4, F14)

       Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a new, empty file.  Currently they invoke  the  vi
       editor, or the editor specified in the EDITOR environment variable, or the Internal File Editor if the use_internal_edit option is on.

       See parameters for external editor for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external editors.

       Copy (F5, F15)

       Press  F5  to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
       directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. Space for destina‐
       tion  file  may be preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option.  During this process, you can press C-c or ESC to abort the
       operation.  For details about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^\(.*\)$ depending on setting of Use shell patterns) and  pos‐
       sible wildcards in the destination see Mask copy/rename.

       F15  (usually  F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
       any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or  pressing  Alt-b  in  the  dialog
       box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Link (C-x l)

       Create a hard link to the current file.

       Absolute symlink (C-x s)

       Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file.

       Relative symLink (C-x v)

       Create a relative symbolic link to the current file.

       To  those  of you who don't know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and
       the destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these files, all changes you make  will  appear  in
       both files. Some people call links aliases or shortcuts.

       A  hard  link  appears  as a real file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you
       delete either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to notice that the files represent the same image.  Use  hard
       links when you don't even want to know.

       A  symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite
       easy to notice that the files represent the same image. Midnight Commander shows an "@"-sign in front of the file name if it is a  symbolic
       link  to  somewhere  (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)).  The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status
       line if the Show mini-status option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links.

       When you press "C-x s" Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for
       the link.  You can change either one.

       Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory:

       /home/frodo/mc/mc -> /home/frodo/new/mc

       A relative link describes the original file's location starting from the location of the link itself:

       /home/frodo/mc/mc -> ../new/mc

       You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing "C-x v" instead of "C-x s".

       Rename/Move (F6, F16)

       Press  F6  to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the
       directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more  details
       look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar.

       F16  (usually  F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of
       any tagged files.

       On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or  pressing  Alt-b  in  the  dialog
       box).  The Background Jobs is used to control the background process.

       Mkdir (F7)

       Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified.

       Delete (F8)

       Delete  the  currently  selected  file or the tagged files in the currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or ESC to
       abort the operation.

       Quick cd (Alt-c) Use the quick cd command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere.

       Select group (+)

       This is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When Files only checkbox is on, only
       files  will  be selected.  If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected.  When Shell Patterns checkbox is on, the regular
       expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one  character).  If
       Shell  Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When Case sensitive checkbox is on,
       the selection will be case sensitive characters.  If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

       Unselect group (\)

       Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Select group command.

       Quit (F10, Shift-F10)

       Terminate Midnight Commander. Shift-F10 is used when you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  Shift-F10 will not take you  to
       the last directory you visited with Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at the directory where you started Midnight Commander.

    Quick cd
       This  command  is  useful  if you have a full command line and want to cd somewhere without having to yank and paste the command line. This
       command pops up a small dialog, where you enter everything you would enter after cd on the command line and then you press enter. This fea‐
       tures all the things that are already in the internal cd command.

  Command Menu
       The Directory tree command shows a tree figure of the directories.

       The "Find file" command allows you to search for a specific file.

       The "Swap panels" command swaps the contents of the two directory panels.

       The "Switch panels on/off" command shows the output of the last shell command.  This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console.

       The  "Compare directories" command compares the directory panels with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make the panels
       identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method compares only file size and file  date.  The  thorough  method  makes  a  full
       byte-by-byte  compare. The thorough method is not available if the machine does not support the mmap(2) system call.  The size-only compare
       method just compares the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date times, it just checks the file size.

       The "External panelize" allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       The "Command history" command shows a list of typed commands. The selected command is copied to the command line. The command  history  can
       also be accessed by typing Alt-p or Alt-n.

       The "Directory hotlist" command makes changing of the current directory to often used directories faster.

       The "Screen list" command shows a dialog window with the list of currently running internal editors, viewers and other MC modules that sup‐
       port this mode.

       The "Edit extension file" command allows you to specify programs to executed when you try to execute, view, edit and do a  bunch  of  other
       thing on files with certain extensions (filename endings).

       The "Edit Menu File" command may be used for editing the user menu (which appears by pressing F2).

    Directory Tree
       The  Directory  Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You can select a directory from the figure and Midnight Commander will
       change to that directory.

       There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is available from Commands menu. The other way  is  to  select  tree
       view from the Left or Right menu.

       To get rid of long delays, Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the direc‐
       tory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press C-r (or F2).

       You can use the following keys:

       General movement keys are accepted.

       Enter.  In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the tree  view,  changes  to
       this directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current panel.

       C-r,  F2  (Rescan).  Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdi‐
       rectories which don't exist any more.

       F3 (Forget).  Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter from the figure. If you want the directory back to the
       tree figure press F2 in its parent directory.

       F4 (Static/Dynamic).  Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static navigation mode.

       In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a directory. All known directories are shown.

       In  the  dynamic  navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent direc‐
       tory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and children directories are shown, others are left out. The
       tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse.

       F5 (Copy).  Copy the directory.

       F6 (RenMov).  Move the directory.

       F7 (Mkdir).  Make a new directory below this directory.

       F8 (Delete).  Delete this directory from the file system.

       C-s, Alt-s.  Search the next directory matching the search string. If there is no such directory these keys will move one line down.

       C-h, Backspace.  Delete the last character of the search string.

       Any other character.  Add the character to the search string and move to the next directory which starts with these characters. In the tree
       view you must first activate the search mode by pressing C-s. The search string is shown in the mini status line.

       The following actions are available only in the directory tree. They aren't supported in the tree view.

       F1 (Help).  Invoke the help viewer and show this section.

       Esc, F10.  Exit the directory tree. Do not change the directory.

       The mouse is supported. A double-click behaves like Enter. See also the section on mouse support.

    Find File
       The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing  the  Tree  button
       you can select the start directory from the directory tree figure.

       The "File name" input field contains a filename pattern to be searched for. It is interpreted as a shell pattern or as a regular expression
       depending on the state of the "Using shell patterns" checkbox. An empty value is valid and matches any file name.

       The "Content" input field contains a string to search for within the files. Leave this field empty to disable searching file contents.

       Option "Whole words" allows select only those files containing matches that form whole words. Like grep -w.

       You can start the search by pressing the OK button.  During the search you can stop from the Stop button and continue from the  Start  but‐
       ton.

       You  can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir button will change to the directory of the currently selected file.
       The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize button  will  place
       the  found  files  to the current directory panel so that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). To
       return to the normal file listing, change directory to "..".

       The 'Enable ignore directories' checkbox and input field below it allow to set up the list of directories that should be  skip  during  the
       search  files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link). List com‐
       ponents must be separated with a colon, here is an example:

       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs

       Relative paths are supported also. The following example shows how to skip special directories of version control systems:
       /cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS

       Attention: input field can contain a dot (.), this means the current absolute path.

       You may consider using the External panelize command for some operations. Find file command is for simple queries only, while using  Exter‐
       nal panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like.

    External panelize
       The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program the contents of the current panel.

       For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external paneliza‐
       tion to run the following command:

       find . -type l -print

       Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no longer be the directory listing of the current directory, but all  the
       files that are symbolic links.

       If  you  want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file
       name from the transfer log files:

       awk '$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }' < /var/log/xferlog

       You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name, so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing  the
       command  on  the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you
       just choose that command from the list and do not have to type it again.

    Hotlist
       The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories in the directory hotlist. Midnight Commander will change to the directory
       corresponding  to  the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog, you can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones.  To
       add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the  directory  hotlist,
       asking just for the label for the directory.

       This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the CDPATH variable as described in internal cd command description.

    Edit Extension File
       This will invoke your editor on the file ~/.config/mc/mc.ext.  The format of this file following:

       All lines starting with # or empty lines are thrown away.

       Lines starting in the first column should have following format:

       keyword/expr, i.e. everything after the slash until new line is expr.

       keyword can be:

       shell  - expr is an extension (no wildcards).  File matches it its name ends with expr.  Example: shell/.tar matches *.tar.

       regex  - expr is a regular expression.  File matches if its name matches the regular expression.

       directory
              - expr is a regular expression.  File matches if it is a directory and its name matches the regular expression.

       type   -  expr is a regular expression.  File matches if the output of file %f without the initial "filename:" part matches regular expres‐
              sion expr.

       default
              - matches any file.  expr is ignored.

       include
              - denotes a common section.  expr is the name of the section.

       Other lines should start with a space or tab and should be of the format: keyword=command (with no spaces around =), where  keyword  should
       be:  Open  (invoked  on  Enter  or  double  click), View (F3), Edit (F4) or Include (to add rules from the common section).  command is any
       one-line shell command, with the simple macro substitution.

       Rules are matched from top to bottom, thus the order is important.  If the appropriate action is missing, search continues as if this  rule
       didn't  match  (i.e. if a file matches the first and second entry and View action is missing in the first one, then on pressing F3 the View
       action from the second entry will be used).  default should match all the actions.

    Background Jobs
       This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander process (only copy and move files operations can be done in the  back‐
       ground).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here.

    Edit Menu File
       The  user  menu  is  a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the
       current directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable.  If no such file found,  ~/.con‐
       fig/mc/menu is tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu /usr/share/mc/mc.menu.

       The  format  of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order
       to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are  the  com‐
       mands that will be executed when the entry is selected.

       When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp)
       and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the menus.  Also  simple  macro  substitution  takes
       place before executing the menu code. For more information, see macro substitution.

       Here is a sample mc.menu file:

       A    Dump the currently selected file
            od -c %f

       B    Edit a bug report and send it to root
            I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
            vi $I
            mail -s "Midnight Commander bug" root < $I
            rm -f $I

       M    Read mail
            emacs -f rmail

       N    Read Usenet news
            emacs -f gnus

       H    Call the info hypertext browser
            info

       J    Copy current directory to other panel recursively
            tar cf - . | (cd %D && tar xvpf -)

       K    Make a release of the current subdirectory
            echo -n "Name of distribution file: "
            read tar
            ln -s %d `dirname %d`/$tar
            cd ..
            tar cvhf ${tar}.tar $tar

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       X       Extract the contents of a compressed tar file
            tar xzvf %f

       Default Conditions

       Each  menu  entry  may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start from the first column with a '=' character. If the condition is
       true, the menu entry will be the default entry.

       Condition syntax:   = <sub-cond>
         or:               = <sub-cond> | <sub-cond> ...
         or:               = <sub-cond> & <sub-cond> ...

       Sub-condition is one of following:

         y <pattern>       syntax of current file matching pattern?
                      (for edit menu only)
         f <pattern>       current file matching pattern?
         F <pattern>       other file matching pattern?
         d <pattern>       current directory matching pattern?
         D <pattern>       other directory matching pattern?
         t <type>          current file of type?
         T <type>          other file of type?
         x <filename>      is it executable filename?
         ! <sub-cond>      negate the result of sub-condition

       Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the
       shell patterns option by writing "shell_patterns=x" on the first line of the menu file (where "x" is either 0 or 1).

       Type is one or more of the following characters:

         n  not a directory
         r  regular file
         d  directory
         l  link
         c  character device
         b  block device
         f  FIFO (pipe)
         s  socket
         x  executable file
         t  tagged

       For  example  'rlf'  means  either regular file, link or fifo. The 't' type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the
       file. The condition '=t t' is true if there are tagged files in the current panel and false if not.

       If the condition starts with '=?' instead of '=' a debug trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated.

       The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means
            = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       is calculated as
            ( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) & (t n)

       Here is a sample of the use of conditions:

       = f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz & t n
       L    List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
            gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -

       Addition Conditions

       If the condition begins with '+' (or '+?') instead of '=' (or '=?') it is an addition condition. If the condition is true  the  menu  entry
       will be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not be included in the menu.

       You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition with '+=' or '=+' (or '+=?' or '=+?' if you want debug trace). If you
       want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one
       starting with '+' and another starting with '='.

       Comments are started with '#'. The additional comment lines must start with '#', space or tab.

  Options Menu
       Midnight  Commander  has  some  options  that may be toggled on and off in several dialogs which are accessible from this menu. Options are
       enabled if they have an asterisk or "x" in front of them.

       The Configuration command pops up a dialog from which you can change most of settings of Midnight Commander.

       The Layout command pops up a dialog from which you specify a bunch of options how mc looks like on the screen.

       The Panel options command pops up a dialog from which you specify options of file manager panels.

       The Confirmation command pops up a dialog from which you specify which actions you want to confirm.

       The Appearance command pops up a dialog from which you specify the skin.

       The Display bits command pops up a dialog from which you may select which characters is your terminal able to display.

       The Learn keys command pops up a dialog from which you test some keys which are not working on some terminals and you may fix them.

       The Virtual FS command pops up a dialog from which you specify some VFS related options.

       The Save setup command saves the current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus. A small number of other settings is saved, too.

    Configuration
       The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: "File operation  options",  "Esc  key  mode",  "Pause  after  run"  and  "Other
       options".

       File operation options

       Verbose operation.  This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each oper‐
       ation). If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if  the  speed  of  your
       terminal is less than 9600 bps.

       Compute  totals.   If  this  option  is  enabled, Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files prior to any Copy,
       Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense of some  speed.  This  option  has  no
       effect, if Verbose operation is disabled.

       Classic progressbar.  If this option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete operations is always grown form left to right. If dis‐
       abled, the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left  panel  to  right  one  and  vice
       versa. Enabled by default.

       Mkdir  autoname.   When  you  press  F7 to create a new directory, the input line in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or
       directory in active panel.  Disabled by default.

       Preallocate space.  Preallocate space for whole target file, if possible, before copy operation.  Disabled by default.

       Esc key mode.

       By default, Midnight Commander treats the ESC key as a key prefix.  Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But  there
       is a possibility to use a single press of ESC key for that action.

       Single  press.  By default this option is disabled. If you'll enable it, the ESC key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see
       Timeout option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the ESC key is interpreted as a cancel key (ESC ESC).

       Timeout.  This options is used to setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press of ESC key. By default, this interval  is  one
       second  (1000000  microseconds). Also the timeout can be set via KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable (also in microseconds), which
       has higher priority than Timeout option value.

       Pause after run

       After executing your commands, Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine the output of the command.  There are  three  possible
       settings for this variable:

       Never.   Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will
       be able to see the output of the command by typing C-o.

       On dumb terminals.  You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of showing the output of  the  last  command  executed
       (any terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console).

       Always.  The program will pause after executing all of your commands.

       Other options

       Use  internal  editor.   If  this  option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor
       specified in the EDITOR environment variable is used.  If no editor is specified, vi is used.  See the section on the internal file editor.

       Use internal viewer.  If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager spec‐
       ified in the PAGER environment variable is used.  If no pager is specified, the view command is used.  See the section on the internal file
       viewer.

       Ask new file name.  If this option is enabled, file name is asked before open new file in editor.

       Auto menus.  If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup.  Useful for building menus for non-unixers.

       Drop down menus.  When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise,  you  will
       only  get  the  menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you
       are using hotkeys.

       Shell Patterns.  By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like regular expressions. The following conversions are
       performed  to  achieve this: the '*' is replaced by '.*' (zero or more characters); the '?'  is replaced by '.' (exactly one character) and
       '.' by the literal dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones described in ed(1).

       Complete: show all.  By default, Midnight Commander pops up all possible completions if the completion is ambiguous  only  when  you  press
       Alt-Tab  for  the  second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this
       option if you want to see all possible completions even after pressing Alt-Tab the first time.

       Rotating dash.  If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner as  a  work  in  progress
       indicator.

       Cd  follows  links.  This option, if set, causes Midnight Commander to follow the logical chain of directories when changing current direc‐
       tory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behavior of bash. When unset, Midnight Commander follows  the  real
       directory  structure, so cd .. if you've entered that directory through a link will move you to the current directory's real parent and not
       to the directory where the link was present.

       Safe delete.  If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The  default
       selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from "Yes" to "No".  This option is disabled by default.

       Auto  save setup.  If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the configurable options of Midnight Commander are saved in
       the ~/.config/mc/ini file.

    Layout
       The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout of screen. The options in  this  dialog  are  divided  into  several
       groups: "Panel split", "Console output" and "Other options".

       Panel split

       The  rest  of  the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You can specify whether the area is split to the panels in Vertical or
       Horizontal direction. Panel layout can be changed using Alt-, (Alt-comma) shortcut.

       Equal split.  By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you can specify an unequal split.

       Console output

       On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window. This option is available if Midnight Comman‐
       der runs on native console only.

       Other options

       Menu bar visible.  If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is always visible on the top row of screen above panels. Enabled by default.

       Command prompt.  If enabled, command line is avalable. Enabled by default.

       Keybar visible.  If enabled, 10 lables associated with F1-F10 keys are located at the bottom row of screen. Enabled by default.

       Hintbar visible.  If enabled, the one-line hints are visible below panels. Enabled by default.

       XTerm  window  title.   When  run  in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the terminal window title to the current working
       directory and updates it when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some incorrect output on  startup  and  directory
       change, turn off this option.  Enabled by default.

       Show free space.  If enabled, free space and total space of current file system is shown at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default.

    Panel options
       Main panel options

       Show  mini-status.   If  enabled,  one  line  of status information about the currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels.
       Enabled by default.

       Use SI size units.  If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use SI units (powers of 1000) when displaying any  byte  sizes.  The
       suffixes  (k, m ...) are shown in lowercase.  If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use binary units (powers of 1024) and the suf‐
       fixes are shown in upper case (K, M ...)

       Mix all files.  If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together.  If the option is disabled (default), direc‐
       tories (and links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below.

       Show  backup  files.   If  enabled,  Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde.  Otherwise, they won't be shown (like GNU's ls
       option -B). Enabled by default.

       Show hidden files.  If enabled, Midnight Commander will show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default.

       Fast directory reload.  If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use a trick to determine if the directory contents have changed.
       The  trick  is  to reload the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means that reloads only happen when files are
       created or deleted.  If what changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the  display
       is not updated.  In these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with C-r). Disabled by default.

       Mark moves down.  If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with Insert key). Enabled by default.

       Reverse files only.  Allow revert selection of files only. Enabled by default.  If enabled, the reverse selection is applied to files only,
       not to directories.  The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection is applied to files as well  to  directories:
       all unselected items become selected, and vice versa.

       Simple  swap.   If  both  panels contain file listing, simple swap means that panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become right
       one, and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange  its  content  keeping  listing  format  and  sort  options.
       Unchecked by default.

       Auto  save  panels  setup.   If  this  option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the current settings of panels are saved in the
       ~/.config/mc/panels.ini file.  Disabled by default.

       Navigation

       Lynx-like motion.  If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory
       and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off.

       Page scrolling.  If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel,
       otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time.

       Center scrolling.  If set, panel will scroll when the cursor reaches the middle of the panel column, only hitting the top or bottom of  the
       panel  when  actually  on  the  first or last file. This behavior applies when scrolling one file at a time, and does not apply to the page
       up/down keys.

       Mouse page scrolling.  Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or line by line on the panels.

       File highlight

       You can specify whether permissions and file types should be highlighted with  distinctive  Colors.   If  the  permission  highlighting  is
       enabled,  the  parts  of the perm and mode display fields which apply to the user running Midnight Commander are highlighted with the color
       defined by the selected keyword.  If the file type highlighting is enabled,  file  names  are  colored  according  to  rules  described  in
       /etc/mc/filehighlight.ini file. See Filenames Highlight for more info.

       Quick search

       You  can  specify  how  the Quick search mode should work: case insensitively, case sensitively or be matched to the panel sort order: case
       sensitive or not.

    Confirmation
       In this dialog you configure the confirmation options for file deletion, overwriting files, execution by pressing enter, quitting the  pro‐
       gram, directory hotlist entries deletion and history cleanup.

    Appearance
       In this dialog you can select the skin to be used.

       See the Skins section for technical details about the skin definition files.

    Display bits
       This  is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses supports only
       seven output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those  terminals  that  can  display
       full 8 bit characters.

    Learn keys
       This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal.
       They often don't, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken.

       You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys ('h' left, 'j' down, 'k' up and 'l' right).  Once  you  press  any  cursor
       movement key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well.

       You  can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a key and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of
       that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works,  but
       after that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys.  The Tab key should be working always.

       If  some  keys  do not work properly then you won't see OK appear after pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine it.  Do it by
       pressing the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter or Space after selecting the button  with  Tab  or  arrows).
       Then  a message box will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait until the message box disappears.  If you want to abort, just
       press Escape once and wait.

       When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions for the keys you have redefined will be  written  into  the  [termi‐
       nal:TERM]  section  of your ~/.config/mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were
       already working properly are not saved.

    Virtual FS
       This option gives you control over the settings of the Virtual File System.

       Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files  in  the
       file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers).

       Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar files), Midnight Commander needs to create temporary
       uncompressed files on your disk.

       Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of  the  cached
       information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to frequently used file systems.

       Because  of  the format of the tar archives, the Tar filesystem needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most tar
       files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on  the  disk
       in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file.

       Now,  since  we  all  love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it's common that you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it
       later.  Since decompression is slow, Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires,
       all the resources associated with the file system are released.  The default timeout is set to one minute.

       The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers.  It has several options.

       ftp  anonymous password is the password used when you login as "anonymous".  Some sites require a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand,
       you probably don't want to give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering.

       ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache.  The cache expire time is configurable with the ftpfs  directory
       cache timeout option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending
       a request to the FTP server.

       You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern firewalls are fully  transparent  at  least  for  passive  FTP  (see
       below), so FTP proxies are considered obsolete.

       If Always use ftp proxy is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts.  See FTP File System for examples.

       If  this  option  is set, the program will do two things: consult the /usr/lib/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that are
       local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their  names  are
       directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the specified FTP proxy.

       You can enable using ~/.netrc file, which keeps login names and passwords for ftp servers.  See netrc (5) for the description of the .netrc
       format.

       Use passive mode enables using FTP passive mode, when the connection for data transfer is initiated by the client, not by the server.  This
       option  is recommended and enabled by default.  If this option is turned off, the data connection is initiated by the server.  This may not
       work with some firewalls.

    Save Setup
       At startup, Midnight Commander will try to load initialization information from the ~/.config/mc/ini file. If this file doesn't  exist,  it
       will  load  the information from the system-wide configuration file, located in /usr/share/mc/mc.ini. If the system-wide configuration file
       doesn't exist, MC uses the default settings.

       The Save Setup command creates the ~/.config/mc/ini file by saving the current settings of the Left, Right and Options menus.

       If you activate the auto save setup option, MC will always save the current settings when exiting.

       There also exist settings which can't be changed from the menus. To change these settings you  have  to  edit  the  setup  file  with  your
       favorite editor. See the section on Special Settings for more information.

Executing operating system commands
       You  may  execute commands by typing them directly in Midnight Commander's input line, or by selecting the program you want to execute with
       the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter.

       If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, Midnight Commander checks the extension of the selected file against the  extensions
       in  the Extensions File.  If a match is found then the code associated with that extension is executed. A very simple macro expansion takes
       place before executing the command.

  The cd internal command
       The cd command is interpreted by Midnight Commander, it is not passed to the command shell for execution.  Thus it may not  handle  all  of
       the nice macro expansion and substitution that your shell does, although it does some of them:

       Tilde  substitution.   The (~) will be substituted with your home directory, if you append a username after the tilde, then it will be sub‐
       stituted with the login directory of the specified user.

       For example, ~guest is the home directory for the user guest, while ~/guest is the directory guest in your home directory.

       Previous directory.  You can jump to the directory you were previously by using the special directory name '-' like this: cd -

       CDPATH directories.  If the directory specified to the cd command is not in the current directory, then Midnight Commander uses  the  value
       in the environment variable CDPATH to search for the directory in any of the named directories.

       For  example  you  could set your CDPATH variable to ~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change your directory to any of the directories inside
       the ~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place in the file system by using its relative name (for example cd linux could  take  you  to
       /usr/src/linux).

  Macro Substitution
       When  accessing  a user menu, or executing an extension dependent command, or running a command from the command line input, a simple macro
       substitution takes place.

       The macros are:

       %i     The indent of blank space, equal the cursor column position.  For edit menu only.

       %y     The syntax type of current file. For edit menu only.

       %k     The block file name.

       %e     The error file name.

       %m     The current menu name.

       %f and %p
              The current file name.

       %x     The extension of current file name.

       %b     The current file name without extension.

       %d     The current directory name.

       %F     The current file in the unselected panel.

       %D     The directory name of the unselected panel.

       %t     The currently tagged files.

       %T     The tagged files in the unselected panel.

       %u and %U
              Similar to the %t and %T macros, but in addition the files are untagged.  You can use this macro only once per menu  file  entry  or
              extension file entry, because next time there will be no tagged files.

       %s and %S
              The selected files: The tagged files if there are any. Otherwise the current file.

       %cd    This  is  a special macro that is used to change the current directory to the directory specified in front of it.  This is used pri‐
              marily as an interface to the Virtual File System.

       %view  This macro is used to invoke the internal viewer.  This macro can be used alone, or with arguments.  If you pass  any  arguments  to
              this macro, they should be enclosed in brackets.

              The  arguments  are: ascii to force the viewer into ascii mode; hex to force the viewer into hex mode; nroff to tell the viewer that
              it should interpret the bold and underline sequences of nroff; unformatted to tell the viewer to not interpret  nroff  commands  for
              making the text bold or underlined.

       %%     The % character

       %{some text}
              Prompt  for  the substitution. An input box is shown and the text inside the braces is used as a prompt. The macro is substituted by
              the text typed by the user. The user can press ESC or F10 to cancel. This macro doesn't work on the command line yet.

       %var{ENV:default}
              If environment variable ENV is unset, the default is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of ENV is substituted.

  The subshell support
       The subshell support is a compile time option, that works with the shells: bash, ash (BusyBox and Debian), tcsh, zsh and fish.

       When the subshell support is active, Midnight Commander will spawn a concurrent copy of your shell (the one defined in the  SHELL  variable
       and  if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time
       you execute a command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed it.  This also allows you to change  the  environment
       variables, use shell functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit Midnight Commander.

       bash   users   may   specify   startup   commands   in   ~/.local/share/mc/bashrc   (fallback  ~/.bashrc)  and  special  keyboard  maps  in
       ~/.local/share/mc/inputrc (fallback ~/.inputrc).

       ash/dash users (BusyBox or Debian) may specify startup commands in ~/.local/share/mc/ashrc (fallback ~/.profile).

       tcsh, zsh, fish users cannot specify mc-specific startup commands at present. They have to rely on shell-specific startup files.

       The following paragraphs are relevant only when the subshell support is active:

       You can suspend applications at any time with the sequence C-o and jump back to Midnight Commander, if you interrupt  an  application,  you
       will not be able to run other external commands until you quit the application you interrupted.

       The  basic  prompt  displayed  by  Midnight Commander is of the form "user@host:current_path$ ". When using a capable shell, like Bash, the
       prompt displayed by Midnight Commander will be the same prompt that you are currently using in your shell.

       (There's a known problem when using fish: the prompt is displayed only in full screen mode (Ctrl-o), not when the panels are visible.)

       The OPTIONS section has more information on how you can control subshell usage (-U/-u).  Furthermore, to set a specific subshell  different
       from your current SHELL variable or login shell defined in /etc/passwd, you may call MC like this: SHELL=/bin/myshell mc

Chmod
       The  Chmod  window is used to change the attribute bits in a group of files and directories.  It can be invoked with the C-x c key combina‐
       tion.

       The Chmod window has two parts - Permissions and File.

       In the File section are displayed the name of the file or directory and its permissions in octal form, as well as its owner and group.

       In the Permissions section there is a set of check buttons which correspond to the file attribute bits.  As you change the attribute  bits,
       you can see the octal value change in the File section.

       To  move between the widgets (buttons and check buttons) use the arrow keys or the Tab key.  To change the state of the check buttons or to
       select a button use Space.  You can also use the hotkeys on the buttons to quickly activate them.  Hotkeys are shown as highlighted letters
       on the buttons.

       To set the attribute bits, use the Enter key.

       When  working  with  a group of files or directories, you just click on the bits you want to set or clear.  Once you have selected the bits
       you want to change, you select one of the action buttons (Set marked or Clear marked).

       Finally, to set the attributes exactly to those specified, you can use the [Set all] button, which will act on all the tagged files.

       [Marked all] set only marked attributes to all selected files

       [Set marked] set marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Clean marked] clear marked bits in attributes of all selected files

       [Set] set the attributes of one file

       [Cancel] cancel the Chmod command

Chown
       The Chown command is used to change the owner/group of a file. The hot key for this command is C-x o.

Advanced Chown
       The Advanced Chown command is the Chmod and Chown command combined into one window. You can change the permissions and owner/group of files
       at once.

File Operations
       When you copy, move or delete files, Midnight Commander shows the file operations dialog.  It shows the files currently being processed and
       uses up to three progress bars.  The file bar indicates the percentage of the current file that has been processed so far.  The  count  bar
       shows  how  many  of the tagged files have been handled.  The bytes bar indicates the percentage of the total size of the tagged files that
       has been handled.  If the verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not shown.

       There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip button will skip the rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort but‐
       ton will abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped.

       There are three other dialogs which you can run into during the file operations.

       The  error dialog informs about error conditions and has three choices.  Normally you select either the Skip button to skip the file or the
       Abort button to abort the operation altogether.  You can also select the Retry button if you fixed the problem from another terminal.

       The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on the top of an existing file.  The dialog shows the dates  and  sizes
       of  the both files.  Press the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No button to skip the file, the All button to overwrite all the files,
       the None button to never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the source file is newer than the target file.  You can abort  the
       whole operation by pressing the Abort button.

       The  recursive  delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory which is not empty.  Press the Yes button to delete the directory
       recursively, the No button to skip the directory, the All button to delete all the  directories  and  the  None  button  to  skip  all  the
       non-empty  directories.  You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button.  If you selected the Yes or All button you will be
       asked for a confirmation.  Type "yes" only if you are really sure you want to do the recursive delete.

       If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the files on which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and  skipped
       files are left tagged.

Mask Copy/Rename
       The  copy/move  operations  let you translate the names of files in an easy way.  To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and
       usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards.  All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed  accord‐
       ing to the target mask.  If there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask are renamed.

       There are other options which you can set:

       Follow links

       determines  whether  make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target direc‐
       tory or whether would you like to copy their content.

       Dive into subdirs

       determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but the target directory already exists.  The default action is to
       copy  the contents of the source directory into the target directory.  Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into
       the target directory.

       For example, you want to copy directory /foo containing file bar to /bla/foo, which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when  Dive
       into  subdirs is not set), mc would copy file /foo/bar into the file /bla/foo/bar.  By enabling this option the /bla/foo/foo directory will
       be created, and /foo/bar will be copied into /bla/foo/foo/bar.

       Preserve attributes

       determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root) the ownership of the original files.  If  this  option  is
       not set, the current value of the umask will be respected.

       Use shell patterns

       When  this  option  is on you can use the '*' and '?' wildcards in the source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the target mask
       only the '*' and '\<digit>' wildcards are allowed. The first '*' wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the
       source  mask,  the  second '*' corresponds to the second group and so on.  The '\1' wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the
       source mask, the '\2' wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to '\9'.  The '\0' wildcard is the  whole  filename
       of the source file.

       Two examples:

       If  the source mask is "*.tar.gz", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be "foo.tgz" in
       "/bla".

       Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" would become "c.file" and so on.  The source mask for this  is  "*.*"  and
       the destination is "\2.\1".

       Use shell patterns off

       When  the  shell patterns option is off the MC doesn't do automatic grouping anymore. You must use '\(...\)' expressions in the source mask
       to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise  target  masks  are
       similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on.

       Two examples:

       If  the  source  mask  is  "^\(.*\)\.tar\.gz$", the destination is "/bla/*.tgz" and the file to be copied is "foo.tar.gz", the copy will be
       "/bla/foo.tgz".

       Let's suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that "file.c" will become "c.file"  and  so  on.  The  source  mask  for  this  is
       "^\(.*\)\.\(.*\)$" and the destination is "\2.\1".

       Case Conversions

       You  can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use '\u' or '\l' in the target mask, the next character will be converted to upper‐
       case or lowercase correspondingly.

       If you use '\U' or '\L' in the target mask, the next characters will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the  next
       '\E' or next '\U', '\L' or the end of the file name.

       The '\u' and '\l' are stronger than '\U' and '\L'.

       For  example, if the source mask is '*' ( Use shell patterns on) or '^\(.*\)$' ( Use shell patterns off) and the target mask is '\L\u*' the
       file names will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case.

       You can also use '\' as a quote character. For example, '\\' is a backslash and '\*' is an asterisk.

       Stable symlinks

       commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target, so that they'll point to the same location  as  it  did  before.
       With absolute symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other
       directory parts and making the value as short as possible (most modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus  don't  waste
       much disk space).

Select/Unselect Files
       The  dialog of group of files and directories selection or uselection.  The input line allow enter the regular expression of filenames that
       will be selected/unselected.

       When Files only checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If Files only is off, as files as directories will be selected.   When  Shell
       Patterns checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and
       ?  standing for one character). If Shell Patterns is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see  ed  (1)).
       When Case sensitive checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters.  If Case sensitive is off, the case will be ignored.

Internal Diff Viewer
       The mcdiff is a visual diff tool. You can compare two files and edit them in-place (diffs are updated dynamically). You can browse and view
       a working copy from popular version control systems (GIT, Subversion, etc).

       Following shortcuts are available in internal diff viewer of Midnight Commander.

       C-Home Move to the file beginning.

       C-End, C1 Move to the file end.

Internal File Viewer
       The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex.  To toggle between modes, use the F4 key.

       The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your system or the file type to display the information.  Some character  sequences,
       which appear most often in preformatted manual pages, are displayed bold and underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files.

       When  in  hex  mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and constant numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly after removing the
       quotes.  Each number matches one byte.  You can mix quoted text with constants like this:

       "String" -1 0xBB 012 "more text"

       Note that 012 is an octal number.  -1 is converted to 0xFF.

       Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the Midnight Commander handles in the internal file viewer.

       F1 Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer.

       F2 Toggle the wrap mode.

       F4 Toggle the hex mode.

       F5 Goto line.  This will prompt you for a line number and will display that line.

       Alt-e to change charset of displayed text may use M-e (Alt-e).  Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the
       recoding you may select "<No translation>" in charset selection dialog.

       It's possible to instruct the file viewer how to display a file, look at the Edit Extension File section

Internal File Editor
       The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can edit files up to 64 megabytes.   It  is  possible  to  edit  binary
       files.  The internal file editor is invoked using F4 if the use_internal_edit option is set in the initialization file.

       The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro com‐
       mands; regular expression search and replace; shift-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite  toggle;  word
       wrap;  autoindent;  tunable  tab size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands
       like indent and ispell.

       Sections:

              Options of editor in ini-file

       The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other  keys
       are:  Shift  movement keys do text highlighting.  Ctrl-Ins copies to the file mcedit.clip and Shift-Ins pastes from mcedit.clip.  Shift-Del
       cuts to mcedit.clip, and Ctrl-Del deletes highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by hold‐
       ing down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work.

       To  define  a macro, press Ctrl-R and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed. Press Ctrl-R again when finished. You can then
       assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press Ctrl-A and then the assigned key. The macro
       is  also  executed  if  you  press  Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not used for any other function. Once
       defined, the macro commands go into the file ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line
       in this file.

       To  change  charset  of  displayed  text  may use M-e (Alt-e).  Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the
       recoding you may select "<No translation>" in charset selection dialog.

       F19 will format  the  currently  highlighted  block  (plain  text  or  C  or  C++  code  or  another).  This  is  controlled  by  the  file
       /usr/share/mc/edit.indent.rc which is copied to ~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc in your home directory the first time you use it.

       The  editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set display bits to 7 bits in the options menu to
       keep the spacing clean.

Options of editor in ini-file
       Some editor options of ini-file are described in this section.  Options are placed in [Midnight-Commander] section

       editor_wordcompletion_collect_entire_file
              Search autocomplete candidates in entire of file or just from begin of file to cursor position (0)

Screen selector
       Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules (such as editor, viewer and diff viewer)  simultaneously  and  switching  between
       them without closing open files. Using several file managers at a time, however, is not currently supported.

       Let's call each of these modules a screen. There are three ways to switch between screens, using one of these global shortcuts:

       Alt-}  switch to the next screen;

       Alt-{  switch to the previous screen;

       Alt-`  open a dialog window with the list of currently open screens (or use the "Screen list" menu item).

Completion
       Let Midnight Commander type for you.

       Attempt  to  perform  completion  on  the  text before current position.  MC attempts completion treating the text as variable (if the text
       begins with $), username (if the text begins with ~), hostname (if the text begins with @) or command (if you are on the  command  line  in
       the position where you might type a command, possible completions then include shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in
       turn.  If none of these matches, filename completion is attempted.

       Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works on all input lines, command completion is command line specific.  If the comple‐
       tion  is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the following action depends on the setting of the Complete: show
       all option in the Configuration dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities pops up next to the current  position  and  you  can
       select with the arrow keys and Enter the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in which the possibilities differ to move to a
       subset of all possibilities and complete as much as possible.  If you press Alt-Tab again, only the subset will be shown  in  the  listbox,
       otherwise  the  first  item which matches all the previous characters will be highlighted.  As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disap‐
       pears, but you can hide it by canceling keys Esc, F10 and left and right arrow keys. If Complete: show all is disabled, the dialog pops  up
       only if you press Alt-Tab for the second time, for the first time MC just beeps.

       Apply  escaping of ?, * and & symbols (as \?, \*, \& ) in filenames to disallow use them as metasymbols in regular expressions when substi‐
       tution is performed in the input line.

Virtual File System
       Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer is known as the  virtual  file  system  switch.
       The virtual file system switch allows Midnight Commander to manipulate files not located on the Unix file system.

       Currently,  Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the local file system, used for accessing the regular Unix
       file system; the ftpfs, used to manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol; the tarfs, used to manipulate tar and  compressed
       tar  files;  the undelfs, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default file system for Linux systems), fish (for manipu‐
       lating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh).  If the code was compiled with sftpfs (for manipulating files over  SFTP  connec‐
       tions).  If the code was compiled with smbfs support, you can manipulate files on remote systems with the SMB (CIFS) protocol.

       A generic extfs (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software.

       The  VFS  switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each
       one of the file systems is described later in their own section.

  FTP File System
       The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote machines.  To actually use it, you can use the FTP link  item  in  the
       menu or directly change your current directory using the cd command to a path name that looks like this:

       ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]

       The  user, port and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine
       as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the ~/.netrc file.  The optional pass element  is  the  password
       used  for  the  connection.   Using the password in the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear
       text and can be saved to the directory history.

       To enable using FTP proxy, prepend !  (an exclamation sign) to the hostname.

       Examples:

           ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
           ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
           ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub
           ftp://guest@remote-host.com:40/pub
           ftp://miguel:xxx@server/pub

       Please check the Virtual File System dialog box for ftpfs options.

  Tar File System
       The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar files and compressed tar files by using the chdir  command.   To  change
       your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to the tar file by using the following syntax:

       /filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]

       The  mc.ext  file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means that usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter
       into the tar file, see the Edit Extension File section for details on how this is done.

       Examples:

           mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
           /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://

       The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive.

  FIle transfer over SHell filesystem
       The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were  local.  To
       use this, the other side has to either run fish server, or has to have bash-compatible shell.

       To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format:

       sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]

       The  user,  options  and  remote-dir  elements  are optional.  If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will try to login on the
       remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name.

       The available options are:
         'C' - use compression;
         'r' - use rsh instead of ssh;
         port - specify the port used by remote server.
       If the remote-dir element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
           sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private
           sh://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
           sh://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private

  SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) filesystem
       The SFTP file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local.

       To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format:

       sftp://[user@]machine:[port]/[remote-dir]

       The user, port and remote-dir elements are optional.  If you specify the user element, Midnight Commander will try to login on  the  remote
       machine  as  that  user,  otherwise  it  will  use your login name.  port - specify the port used by remote server (22 by default).  If the
       remote-dir element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one.

       Examples:

           sftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local
           sftp://joe:password@want.compression.edu/private
           sftp://joe@noncompressed.ssh.edu/private
           sftp://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private

  Undelete File System
       On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete facilities, you will have the undelete file system available.  Recovery
       of  deleted  files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The undelete file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve
       all of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the selected files into a regular partition.

       To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name formed by the "undel://" prefix and the file name  where  the  actual
       file system resides.

       For example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name:

           undel://sda2

       It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information before you start browsing files there.

  SMB File System
       The  smbfs  allows  you  to manipulate files on remote machines with SMB (or CIFS) protocol.  These include Windows for Workgroups, Windows
       9x/ME/XP, Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Samba.  To actually use it, you may try to use the panel command "SMB link..."  (accessible from the
       menubar) or you may directly change your current directory to it using the cd command to a path name that looks like this:

       smb://[user@]machine[/service][/remote-dir]

       The user, service and remote-dir elements are optional.  The user, domain and password can be specified in an input dialog.

       Examples:

           smb://machine/Share
           smb://other_machine
           smb://guest@machine/Public/Irlex

  EXTernal File System
       extfs allows you to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts.

       Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories:

       1.  Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing file.  They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree.
       You can invoke them by typing 'cd fsname://' where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such filesystems  include  audio
       (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system).

       For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type

         cd audio://

       2.  'Archive'  filesystems  (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of 'real'
       files compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To  access
       such filesystems 'fsname://' should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself can be on another vfs.

       For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type

         cd documents.zip/uzip://

       In  many  aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from direc‐
       tory history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS.

       Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are:

       a      access 'A:' DOS/Windows diskette (cd a://).

       apt    front end to Debian's APT package management system (cd apt://).

       audio  audio CD ripping and playing (cd audio:// or cd device/audio://).

       bpp    package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.bpp/bpp://).

       deb    package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (cd file.deb/deb://).

       dpkg   Debian GNU/Linux installed packages (cd deb://).

       hp48   view and copy files to/from a HP48 calculator (cd hp48://).

       lslR   browsing of lslR listings as found on many FTPs (cd filename/lslR://).

       mailfs mbox-style mailbox files support (cd mailbox/mailfs://).

       patchfs
              extfs to handle unified and context diffs (cd filename/patchfs://).

       rpm    RPM package (cd filename/rpm://).

       rpms   RPM database management (cd rpms://).

       ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha
              archivers (cd archive/xxxx:// where xxxx is one of: ulha, urar, uzip, uzoo, uar, uha).

       You could bind file type/extension to specified extfs as described in the Edit Extension File section.  Here is an example entry for Debian
       packages:

         regex/.deb$
                 Open=%cd %p/deb://

Colors
       Midnight  Commander  will  try  to detect if your terminal supports color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it
       gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag respectively.

       If the program is compiled with the Slang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also check the variable COLORTERM, if it  is  set,  it
       has the same effect as the -c flag.

       You  may  specify terminals that always force color mode by adding the color_terminals variable to the Colors section of the initialization
       file.  This will prevent Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports color.  Example:

       [Colors]
       color_terminals=linux,xterm
       color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...

       The program can be compiled with both ncurses and slang, ncurses does not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the informa‐
       tion in the terminal database.

       Midnight  Commander  provides  a  way  to  change  the  default colors.  Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable
       MC_COLOR_TABLE or the Colors section in the initialization file.

       In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the base_color variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal
       by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=
       xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red

       The format for the color definition is:

         <keyword>=<fgcolor>,<bgcolor>,<attributes>:<keyword>=...

       The  colors  are  optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled, marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged,
       commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory. Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey,  bbarbutton.  Status  bar  color:
       statusbar. Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel, menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfo‐
       cus, dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus, errdtitle.  Help colors are:  helpnormal,  helpitalic,  help‐
       bold, helplink, helpslink, helptitle.  Viewer colors are: viewnormal, viewbold, viewunderline, viewselected. Editor colors are: editnormal,
       editbold, editmarked, editwhitespace, editlinestate. Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel, pmenutitle.

       header determines the color of panel header, the line that contains column titles and sort mode indicator.

       input determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs.

       gauge determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file  operations,
       such as copying.

       disabled determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected.

       The  dialog boxes use the following colors: dnormal is used for the normal text, dfocus is the color used for the currently selected compo‐
       nent, dhotnormal is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal components, whereas the dhotfocus  color  is  used  for  the
       highlighted color in the currently selected component.

       Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead.

       Help uses the following colors: helpnormal is used for normal text, helpitalic is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual
       page, helpbold is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual page, helplink is used for not selected hyperlinks and  helpslink
       is used for selected hyperlink.

       Popup  menu  uses  following  colors: pmenunormal is used for non-selected menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, pmenusel is
       used for selected menu item, pmenutitle is used for popup menu title.

       The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue,  magenta,  brightmagenta,  cyan,
       brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent background. It is 'default'. The 'default' can only be used
       for background color. Another special keyword "base" means mc's main colors.  When 256 colors are available, they can be  specified  either
       as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example:

       [Colors]
       base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default

       Attributes  can  be  any  of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than one are desired.  The special
       word "none" means no attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color.  Example:

       menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline

Skins
       You can change the appearance of Midnight Commander.  To do this, you must specify a file that contain descriptions of colors and lines  to
       draw boxes. Redefining of the colors is entirely compatible with the assignment of colors, as described in Section Colors.

       If your skin contains any of 256-color definitions, you should define the '256colors' key set to TRUE value in [skin] section.

       A skin-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found):

              1) command line option -S <skin> or --skin=<skin>
              2) Environment variable MC_SKIN
              3) Parameter skin in section [Midnight-Commander] in config file.
              4) File /etc/mc/skins/default.ini
              5) File /usr/share/mc/skins/default.ini

       Command  line  option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the skin-file (with the extension
       .ini or without it). Search of skin-file will occur in (to the first one found):

              1) ~/.local/share/mc/skins/
              2) /etc/mc/skins/
              3) /usr/share/mc/skins/

  Compatibility
       Appointment of color  by skin-files fully compatible with the appointment of the colors described in Colors.  section.

       In this case, reassignment of colors has priority over the skin file and is complementary.

Filenames Highlight
       Section [filehighlight] in current skin-file contains key names as highlight groups and values as color pairs. Color pairs is documented in
       Skins section.

       Rules  of filenames highlight are placed in /usr/share/mc/filehighlight.ini file (~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini).  Name of section in this
       file must be equal to parameters names in [filehighlight] section (in current skin-file).

       Keys in these groups are:

       type   file type. If present, all other options are ignored.

       regexp regular expression. If present, 'extensions' option is ignored.

       extensions
              list of extensions of files. Separated by ';' sign.

       extensions_case
              (make sense only with 'extensions' parameter) make 'extensions' rule case sensitive (true) or not (false).

       `type' key may have values:
       - FILE (all files)
         - FILE_EXE
       - DIR (all directories)
         - LINK_DIR
       - LINK (all links except stale link)
         - HARDLINK
         - SYMLINK
       - STALE_LINK
       - DEVICE (all device files)
         - DEVICE_BLOCK
         - DEVICE_CHAR
       - SPECIAL (all special files)
         - SPECIAL_SOCKET
         - SPECIAL_FIFO
         - SPECIAL_DOOR

Special Settings
       Most of Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be  changed
       by editing the setup file.

       These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file:

       clear_before_exec
              By  default,  Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command
              at the bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0.

       confirm_view_dir
              If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If this flag is set to 1, then  MC  will  ask  for  confirmation
              before changing the directory if you have files tagged.

       ftpfs_retry_seconds
              This value is the number of seconds Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the
              login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried.

       max_dirt_limit
              Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal file viewer.   Normally  this  value  is  not  significant,
              because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very
              slow machines or terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy.

              It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and that is the default value.

       mouse_move_pages_viewer
              Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file viewer.

       only_leading_plus_minus
              Allow special treatment for '+', '-', '*' in the command line (select, unselect, reverse selection) only  if  the  command  line  is
              empty.   You  don't  need  to  quote  those characters in the middle of the command line.  On the other hand, you cannot use them to
              change selection when the command line is not empty.

       show_output_starts_shell
              This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support.  When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the  user  screen,
              if this one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to Midnight Commander.

       timeformat_recent
              Change  the  time format used to display dates less than 6 months from now.  See strftime or date man page for the format specifica‐
              tion. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

       timeformat_old
              Change the time format used to display  dates older than 6 months from now or for dates in the future.  See  strftime  or  date  man
              page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used.

       torben_fj_mode
              If  this  flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the
              first and last files in the panels, they will act as follows:

              The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case
              it will go to the first file in the panel.

              The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the
              bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in the panel.

       use_file_to_guess_type
              If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match the file types listed on the mc.ext file.

       xtree_mode
              If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a Tree panel, it  will  automatically  reload  the  other
              panel with the contents of the selected directory.

       fish_directory_timeout
              This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is 900 seconds.

       clipboard_store
              This  variable  contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to read text into X selection from file.
              For example:

       clipboard_store=xclip -i

       clipboard_paste
              This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like 'xclip' to print the selection  to  standard  out.
              For example:

       clipboard_paste=xclip -o

       autodetect_codeset
              This  option  allows  use the `enca' command to autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values
              can be obtain by the `enca --list languages | cut -d : -f1' command. Option must be located in the [Misc] section.

       For example:

       autodetect_codeset=russian

Parameters for external editor or viewer
       Midnight Commander provides a way for specify an options for external editors and viewers. Midnight Commander tries to search the  "[Exter‐
       nal editor or viewer parameters]" section in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander's library direc‐
       tory) and then in the ~/.config/mc/ini file. The option name should be equal to the name (full pathname) of external editor or viewer.  The
       option value can contain following variables:

       %filename
              The filename to edit/view.

       %lineno
              The start line in the opening file.

       For example:

       [External editor or viewer parameters]
           vi=%filename +%lineno
           joe=%filename +%lineno
           more=%filename +%lineno

       Start line is passed to the external editor/viewer only if it is called from the Find file results window.

       If  external  editor/viewer  is launched via F4/F3 keys, MC hopes that program (at least "joe", but probably others too) has an own feature
       that by default opens the file where it was last open. MC doesn't prevent external editor/viewer to save and  restore  position  in  opened
       files.

Terminal databases
       Midnight  Commander  provides  a way to fix your system terminal database without requiring root privileges. Midnight Commander searches in
       the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander's library directory) and in the ~/.config/mc/ini file for the
       section  "terminal:your-terminal-name" and then for the section "terminal:general", each line of the section contains a key symbol that you
       want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.  You can use the special \e form to represent the escape  charac‐
       ter and the ^x to represent the control-x character.

       The possible key symbols are:

       f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
       bs            backspace
       home          home key
       end           end key
       up            up arrow key
       down          down arrow key
       left          left arrow key
       right         right arrow key
       pgdn          page down key
       pgup          page up key
       insert        the insert character
       delete        the delete character
       complete      to do completion

       For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini file:

       insert=\e[Op

       Also now you can use extended learn keys.  For example:

           ctrl-alt-right=\e[[1;6C
           ctrl-alt-left=\e[[1;6D

       This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a \e[[1;6D escape sequence and therefore Midnight Commander interprets "\e[[1;6D" as Ctrl-Alt-Left.

       The  complete  key  symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can
       define other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys everywhere).

FILES
       Full paths below may vary between installations.  They are also affected by the MC_DATADIR environment variable. If it's set, its value  is
       used instead of /usr/share/mc in the paths below.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hlp

              The help file for the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ext

              The default system-wide extensions file.

       ~/.config/mc/mc.ext

              User's  own  extension,  view  configuration  and  edit  configuration file.  They override the contents of the system wide files if
              present.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.ini

              The default system-wide setup for Midnight Commander, used only if the user doesn't have his own ~/.config/mc/ini file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.lib

              Global settings for Midnight Commander. Settings in this file affect all users, whether they have  ~/.config/mc/ini  or  not.   Cur‐
              rently, only terminal settings are loaded from mc.lib.

       ~/.config/mc/ini

              User's own setup. If this file is present then the setup is loaded from here instead of the system-wide startup file.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.hint

              This file contains the hints displayed by the program.

       /usr/share/mc/mc.menu

              This file contains the default system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.config/mc/menu

              User's own application menu. If this file is present it is used instead of the system-wide applications menu.

       ~/.cache/mc/Tree

              The directory list for the directory tree and tree view features.

       ~/.local/share/mc.menu

              Local user-defined menu. If this file is present, it is used instead of the home or system-wide applications menu.

       To change default root directory of MC, you can use MC_HOME environment variable. The value of MC_HOME must be an absolute path. If MC_HOME
       is unset or empty, HOME variable is used. If HOME is unset or empty, MC directories are get from GLib library.
