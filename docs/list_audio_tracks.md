       This  manpage  describes  the  program implementation of list_audio_tracks as shipped by the cdrkit distribution. See http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/ for details. It is a spinoff from the
       original program called cdda2wav distributed by the cdrtools project. However, the cdrtools developers are not involved in the development of this spinoff and therefore shall not be made responsible
       for any problem caused by it. Do not try to get support for this program by contacting the original authors.

       If you have support questions, send them to

       debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org

       If you have definitely found a bug, send a mail to this list or to
