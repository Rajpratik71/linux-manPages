lxc-usernsexec(1)                                                                   lxc-usernsexec(1)

NAME
       lxc-usernsexec - Run a task as root in a new user namespace.

SYNOPSIS
       lxc-usernsexec [-m uid-map] {-- command}

DESCRIPTION
       lxc-usernsexec can be used to run a task as root in a new user namespace.

OPTIONS
       -m uid-map
              The uid map to use in the user namespace. Each map consists of four colon-separate val‐
              ues. First a character 'u', 'g' or 'b' to specify whether this  map  pertains  to  user
              ids,  group  ids,  or both; next the first userid in the user namespace; next the first
              userid as seen on the host; and finally the number of ids to be mapped.

              More than one map can be specified. If no map is specified, then by  default  the  full
              uid  and  gid  ranges granted by /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid will be mapped to the uids
              and gids starting at 0 in the container.

              Note that lxc-usernsexec always tries to setuid and  setgid  to  0  in  the  namespace.
              Therefore uid 0 in the namespace must be mapped.

EXAMPLES
       To spawn a shell with the full allotted subuids mapped into the container, use

              lxc-usernsexec

       To run a different shell than /bin/sh, use

              lxc-usernsexec -- /bin/bash

       If your user id is 1000, root in a container is mapped to 190000, and you wish to chown a file
       you own to root in the container, you can use:

              lxc-usernsexec -m b:0:1000:1 -m b:1:190000:1 -- /bin/chown 1:1 $file

       This maps your userid to root in the user namespace, and 190000 to uid 1.  Since root  in  the
       user  namespace  is  privileged over all userids mapped into the namespace, you are allowed to
       change the file ownership, which you could not do on the host using a simple chown.
