NAME
       sdmem - secure memory wiper (secure_deletion toolkit)

SYNOPSIS
       sdmem [-f] [-l] [-l] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       sdmem  is  designed  to  delete data which may lie still in your memory (RAM) in a secure manner which can not be recovered by thieves, law
       enforcement or other threats.  Note that with the new SDRAMs, data will not wither away but will be kept static - it is easy to extract the
       necessary  information!   The wipe algorithm is based on the paper "Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory" presented
       at the 6th Usenix Security Symposium by Peter Gutmann, one of the leading civilian cryptographers.

       The secure data deletion process of sdmem goes like this:

       *      1 pass with 0x00

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

       *      27 passes with special values defined by Peter Gutmann.

       *      5 random passes. /dev/urandom is used for a secure RNG if available.

COMMANDLINE OPTIONS
       -f     fast (and insecure mode): no /dev/urandom.

       -l     lessens the security. Only two passes are written: the first with 0x00 and a final random one.

       -l     -l for a second time lessons the security even more: only one pass with 0x00 is written.

       -v     verbose mode

NOTE
       This utility was originally called
              smem but was renamed for debian to avoid name clashes with another package.

BEWARE
       SLOW   Wiping the memory is very slow. You might use sdmem with the -ll option. (tip)

       BETA!  sdmem is still beta.

BUGS
       No bugs. There was never a bug in the secure_deletion package (in contrast to my other tools, whew, good luck ;-)  Send  me  any  that  you
       find.  Patches are nice too :)
