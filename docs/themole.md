NAME
       themole - automatic SQL injection exploitation tool

SYNOPSIS
       themole [ -h ] [ -u url ] [ -n needle ] [-t num_threads]

DESCRIPTION
       The Mole is a command line interface SQL Injection exploitation tool.  This application is able to exploit both union-based and blind bool‚Äê
       ean-based injections.

       Every action The Mole can execute is triggered by a specific command.  All this application requires in order to exploit a SQL Injection is
       the URL(including the parameters) and a needle(a string) that appears in the server's response whenever the injection parameter generates a
       valid query, and does not appear otherwise.

OPTIONS
       -h     Shows the help message and exits.

       -u url Sets the url of the mole's instance to url.

       -n needle
              Sets the needle of the mole's instance to needle. It must be a string that appears when the injection returns  true  and  disappears
              when the injection is false.

       -t threads
              Sets the max number of concurrent requests that the mole will be making.  Cannot be changed at runtime.
