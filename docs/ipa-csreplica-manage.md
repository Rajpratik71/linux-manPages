NAME
       ipa-csreplica-manage - Manage an IPA CS replica

SYNOPSIS
       ipa-csreplica-manage [OPTION]...  [connect|disconnect|del|list|re-initialize|force-sync]

DESCRIPTION
       Manages the CA replication agreements of an IPA server for domain at domain level 0.

       To manage CA replication agreements in a domain at domain level 1, use IPA CLI or Web UI, see `ipa help topology` for additional information.


       connect [SERVER_A] <SERVER_B>
              - Adds a new replication agreement between SERVER_A/localhost and SERVER_B. Applicable only at domain level 0.

       disconnect [SERVER_A] <SERVER_B>
              - Removes a replication agreement between SERVER_A/localhost and SERVER_B. Applicable only at domain level 0.

       del <SERVER>
              - Removes all replication agreements and data about SERVER. Applicable only at domain level 0.


       list [SERVER]
              - Lists all the servers or the list of agreements of SERVER

       re-initialize
              - Forces a full re-initialization of the IPA CA server retrieving data from the server specified with the --from option

       force-sync
              - Immediately flush any data to be replicated from a server specified with the --from option

       set-renewal-master [SERVER]
              - Set CA server which handles renewal of CA subsystem certificates to SERVER

       The connect and disconnect options are used to manage the replication topology. When a replica is created it is only connected with the master that created it. The connect option may be used to con‚Äê
       nect it to other existing replicas.

       The disconnect option cannot be used to remove the last link of a replica. To remove a replica from the topology use the del option.

       If a replica is deleted and then re-added within a short time-frame then the 389-ds instance on the master that created it should be restarted before re-installing the replica. The master will  have
       the old service principals cached which will cause replication to fail.

OPTIONS
       -H HOST, --host=HOST
              The IPA server to manage.  The default is the machine on which the command is run Not honoured by the re-initialize command.

       -p DM_PASSWORD, --password=DM_PASSWORD
              The Directory Manager password to use for authentication

       -v, --verbose
              Provide additional information

       -f, --force
              Ignore some types of errors

       --from=SERVER
              The server to pull the data from, used by the re-initialize and force-sync commands.

EXAMPLES
       List a server's replication agreements.
               # ipa-csreplica-manage list srv1.example.com
               srv2.example.com
               srv3.example.com

       Re-initialize a replica:
               # ipa-csreplica-manage re-initialize --from srv2.example.com

              This will re-initialize the data on the server where you execute the command, retrieving the data from the srv2.example.com replica

       Add a new replication agreement:
               # ipa-csreplica-manage connect srv2.example.com srv4.example.com

       Remove an existing replication agreement:
               # ipa-csreplica-manage disconnect srv1.example.com srv3.example.com

       Completely remove a replica at domain level 0:
               # ipa-csreplica-manage del srv4.example.com

       Completely remove a replica at domain level 1:
               # ipa-replica-manage del srv4.example.com

       Using connect/disconnect you can manage the replication topology.

EXIT STATUS
       0 if the command was successful

       1 if an error occurred
