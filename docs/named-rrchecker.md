NAME
       named-rrchecker - syntax checker for individual DNS resource records

SYNOPSIS
       named-rrchecker [-h] [-o origin] [-p] [-u] [-C] [-T] [-P]

DESCRIPTION
       named-rrchecker read a individual DNS resource record from standard input and checks if it is syntactically correct.

       The -h prints out the help menu.

       The -o origin option specifies a origin to be used when interpreting the record.

       The -p prints out the resulting record in canonical form. If there is no canonical form defined then the record will be printed in unknown record format.

       The -u prints out the resulting record in unknown record form.

       The -C, -T and -P print out the known class, standard type and private type mnemonics respectively.
