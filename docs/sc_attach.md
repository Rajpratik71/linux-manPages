SC_ATTACH(1)                                                BSD General Commands Manual                                               SC_ATTACH(1)

NAME
     sc_attach â€” simple scamper driver.

SYNOPSIS
     sc_attach [-?dDv] [-c command] [-i infile] [-o outfile] [-p port] [-P priority]

DESCRIPTION
     The sc_attach utility provides the ability to connect to a running scamper(1) instance, have a set of commands defined in a file be executed,
     and the output be written into a single file, in warts format.  The options are as follows:

     -?      prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.

     -d      prints each command sent to scamper(1) on stderr.

     -D      causes sc_attach to operate as a daemon.

     -v      prints the current revision of sc_attach and exits.

     -c command
             specifies the scamper(1) command to prepend to each address in the input file.

     -i infile
             specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of scamper(1) commands or addresses (with the -c option), one per
             line.  If '-' is specified, commands are read from stdin.

     -o outfile
             specifies the name of the output file to be written.  The output file will use the warts format.  If '-' is specified, output will be
             sent to stdout.

     -p port
             specifies the port on the local host where scamper(1) is accepting control socket connections.

     -P priority
             specifies the mixing priority scamper(1) should assign to the source.

EXAMPLES
     Given a set of commands in a file named infile.txt:

        tbit -M 1280 -u 'http://www.example.com/' 2620:0:2d0:200::10
        trace -P udp-paris -M 192.0.2.1
        ping -P icmp-echo 192.0.32.10

     and a scamper(1) daemon listening on port 31337, then these commands can be executed using:

     sc_attach -i infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337

     Given a set of addresses in a file named infile2.txt:

        2620:0:2d0:200::10
        192.0.2.1
        192.0.32.10

     these addresses can be pinged with sc_attach operating as a daemon with:

     sc_attach -D -c 'ping' -i infile2.txt -o outfile2.warts -p 31337
