HUNT(1)                                                       General Commands Manual                                                      HUNT(1)

NAME
       hunt - Network security auditing tool.

SYNOPSIS
       hunt [-V]  [-v] [-i interface]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the hunt command.  This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the origi‐
       nal program does not have a manual page.  Instead, it has documentation in the GNU Info format; see below.

READ FIRST
       Please make sure you KNOW what you are doing before using hunt.  It is recommended that you should test how it behaves on some test connec‐
       tions  and  then use it wisely. You may want to select "options" and then "add conn policy entry" as by default only telnet connections are
       monitored.

OVERVIEW
       Hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and resetting it. It has several features, which I didn't find in any  prod‐
       uct  like  Juggernaut  or  T-sight that inspired me in my development.  I found Juggernaut not flexible enough for further development so I
       started from scratch (see FEATURES and DESIGN OVERVIEW).  Note that hunt is operating on Ethernet and is best used  for  connections  which
       can  be watched through it. However, it is possible to do something even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on switched ports.
       The hunt doesn't distinguish between local network connections and connections going to/from Internet. It can  handle  all  connections  it
       sees.

       Connection  hijacking  is aimed primarily at the telnet or rlogin traffic but it can be used for another traffic too.  The reset, watching,
       arp, ... features are common to all connections.

TECHNICAL EXPLANATION
       Let me explain some technical issues which I use in hunt and which are essential for understanding how it works and what you should expect.
       The important terms are IP spoofing, ARP spoofing and ACK storm.  Even if you are familiar with them, you can get some new information.

       IP spoofing
              You set the packet source address to the IP address of the host you pretend to be.

       ARP spoofing
              You set the packet source hardware address (source MAC address) to the address of the host you pretend to be.

       Simple Active Attack against TCP connections - It is a well known type
              of attack in which you send a packet with spoofed IP addresses and possibly also with spoofed ARP addresses (true MAC  addresses  of
              client  and  server  - not fake ones as explained further). In this way, you can force a command to the stream but you are likely to
              receive the ACK storm (as explained further) unless the original client host of the connection is running Linux.

       ARP spoofing
              I use this term also for forcing the remote host to think that the host I want to be has a different MAC address so the remote  host
              sends  replies to that MAC address and the original client host is not able to receive them (but hunt is watching carefully and han‐
              dles all consequences) (Explaining how to force a host on the network to think that the other host has a different MAC I leave as an
              exercise - I encourage you to read the source code). Please note that I use the term ARP spoofing instead of the term ARP forcing or
              something like that. So don't be confused, if I say ARP spoofing, I mean using some MAC address of a host  or  just  some  fake  MAC
              address.  Note  that ARP spoofing (with my meaning to force some MAC) doesn't work on Solaris2.5 because it has expiration timers on
              ARP entries so you can't easily force Solaris to drop an ARP entry. The entry usually expires after 20min or less (but  you  have  a
              chance to force it and hunt supports this mode). The expiration timers on Solaris are set by:

              ndd -set /dev/ip ip_ire_flush_interval 60000 /* 1 min */
              ndd -set /dev/arp arp_cleanup_interval 60 /* 1 min */

              I  encourage  you  to  ask your netadmin to set the above values on all Solaris machines. The Win95/NT4sp3, Linux2.0, OSF1 V4.0, HP-
              UX10.20 are not protected in this way so you can easily use the described technique on them (actually, they have  timers,  but  they
              are not operating like in Solaris; in fact, only Solaris is the exception). Actually, hunt uses this technique such that it wants to
              force a fake MAC of the server to the client and a fake MAC of the client to the server. Then both the server  and  the  client  are
              sending  packets  to  that faked MACs (and hunt can of course handle them).  However, it is sufficient that only one host has a fake
              MAC of the other host.  The ACK storm can't occur in this situation either. So you can use this technique even if one end is Solaris
              and  the  other  isn't.  You  will  just succeed in the other host and that is enough. So the only problem is when the connection is
              between two Solaris machines. However, if there is any root connection ongoing you can easily  push  the  commands  suggested  above
              without ARP spoofing to the connection and alter the expiration timers of the ARP cache.

       ACK Storm
              The  ACK  storm is caused by majority of TCP stacks (!!!  Linux2.0 is an exception !!!). Let's imagine that you send some data to an
              ongoing connection to the server (as if sent by the client - with expected seq.  numbers,  ...  ).  The  server  responds  with  the
              acknowledgment  of  the  data  you sent but this acknowledgment is received by the original client too. But from the original client
              point of view, the server has acknowledged data that doesn't exist on the client. So something strange  occurred  and  the  original
              client sends the "right" sequence number with ACK to the server.  But the TCP rules say that it is required to generate an immediate
              acknowledgment when an out-of-order segment is received. This ACK should not be delayed. So the server sends the  acknowledgment  of
              non-existent  data  to  the client again. And the client responses, ...  Only if the source host of the connection is Linux then the
              ACK storm doesn't occur. Note that if you use ARP spoofing (forcing) then the ACK storm can't come because one  or  both  ends  will
              send packets with fake MACs and those packets are received by hunt rather than by the other host.

       Connection Reset
              With  a  single  properly  constructed packet you can reset the connection (RST flag in TCP header). Of course, you have to know the
              sequence number but it is not a problem for hunt which is watching all the time. You can reset server, client,  or  both.  When  you
              reset  only  one end the other end is reset when it tries to send data to the first host which will response with RST because of the
              connection reset on it.

       Connection sniffing/watching
              The simplest thing you can do is to silently sit in you chair and watch hunt output about any connection which you choose  from  the
              list.

       Connection Synchronization
              Well,  that's  one  of the main features of hunt. If you put some data to the TCP stream (through simple active attack or ARP spoof‐
              ing), you desynchronize the stream from the server/original client point of view. After some work done on that  connection  you  can
              just  reset  it or you can try to synchronize both original ends again. That is not an easy task. The user on the client is prompted
              to type some chars and some chars are sent to the client and server. The main goal of all stuff is to synchronize the sequence  num‐
              bers on both client and server again.

       Switch/Segment traffic rerouting
              With ARP spoofing you can even force switch so that it will send you the traffic for hosts on another segment/switched port. This is
              because a switch will think that the MAC belongs to your port. Be careful if your switch has some security policy and MACs have been
              explicitly set up on a per port basis - but in fact I don't ever see such a configuration on "ordinary" network.

       ARP-relay daemon
              Don't be confused. I use this term for hunt daemon which is responsible for inserting packets to the network (rerouting) of all data
              it receives from ARP spoofed hosts.

       Switched environment
              Well, the hunt is now capable of watching and hijacking hosts that are on switched ports. In common you can't watch the hosts  traf‐
              fic  on switched ports but if you first ARP spoof them (with ARP spoof daemon menu) you are able to look at the connections that are
              between that hosts. First you do arp spoof and the hosts will send you the traffic and from that time you can list  the  connections
              between  them,  then  you can watch and hijack them. It is commonly accepted that the switches protect your connections again inside
              intruders and spoofers. Well, that is still true for carefully setuped switches. The switches that are plugged to  the  LAN  without
              any port security configuration are useless in the job to protect your LAN.

DESIGN OVERVIEW
       The  development  model is based on a packet engine (hunt.c) which runs in its own thread and captures packets from the network. The packet
       engine collects information of TCP connections/starting/termination, sequence numbers,  and MAC addresses. It collects the  MACs  and  seq.
       numbers  from  the  server point of view and separate MACs and seq. numbers from the client point of view. So it is prepared for hijacking.
       This information (seq. num., MAC,

       Modules can register functions with the packet engine which are then invoked when new packets are received. A module function determines if
       the  module is interested in a packet or not and can place the packet in a module specific list of packets. A module function can also send
       some packet to the network if it is desirable to do it very fast. The module (usually in some other thread so it needs to be  scheduled  to
       be run) then gets packets from the list and analyzes them. In this way, you can easily develop modules which perform various activities.

       Packets  to  be sent as a response to the network are described by structures so you don't have to care about some default fields or check‐
       sums. At this time, functions for TCP, ICMP and ARP traffic are already prepared. (UDP is missing because I don't use it in any module)

       A separate set of daemons is used for host resolving (DNS). That is because the  gethostbyname/gethostbyname_r  function  is  protected  by
       mutex (As far as I know - it was so two years ago - I didn't try it now) so you can't run it truly parallel in a multithreaded environment.
       Therefore, the commonly used workaround is to fire up some helper daemons through fork which will run gethostbyname.

USER ENVIRONMENT
       Well, the user environment isn't graphical but I believe that you will like it.

       In the title of all menus is some status information about hunt.  First, there is an indication with which menu you  are  working.  Second,
       the  number  of packets received by hunt is shown. Hunt pre-allocates some buffers for packets; the status of free and allocated buffers is
       displayed as the third value. The number of free buffers is low for a high loaded network or the ACK storm or if you have poor hardware. In
       my  case,  for  example,  the  numbers 63/64 were normally indicated meaning that only one buffer was used, but after the ACK storm, I have
       something like 322/323. Note that the buffers once allocated are not freed. The low number of free buffers can also mean some bug  in  hunt
       but  I think I carefully debugged all modules to this kind of bug. The last indicator reports which daemons (actually threads) are running.
       They are: R - reset daemon, Y - arp relayer, S - sniffer, M - MAC discoverer. If you switch on the verbose option you get additional infor‐
       mation  about  how  many  packets were dropped - they were fragments (see the bugs) or were malformed, and how many packets belong to other
       protocols than TCP, UDP, ICMP and ARP.  In the prompt for user input is indicator that will tell you through '*' char that hunt  added  new
       connection(s) to the connection list since last connection listening.

       General interface
              In all menus the x key works as escape.  The network mask is denoted by the ip_address/mask notation where mask is the number of 1's
              on the left side of the network mask. For example, 0.0.0.0/0 means everything and 192.168.32.10/32 means only that host.

              For most modules is used:
              l) list items
              a) add item
              m) modify item
              d) delete item
              They will be referred in this text as l) a) m) d)

       List/Watch/Reset connection
              You can obtain the list of connections tracked by the hunt packet engine.  Which connections are tracked is specified in the options
              menu. You can interactively watch or reset these connections. You can also perform hijacking on them (next two menu items).

       ARP/Simple hijack
              ARP/Simple  hijack  offers  you  an  interactive interface for the insertion of data to the selected connection. You can perform ARP
              spoofing for both connection ends, for only one end or you can not to do it at all. If you don't do ARP spoofing then  you  probably
              receive the ACK storm after typing the first char.  When you do ARP spoofing, it is checked if it succeeds. If not, you are prompted
              if you want to wait until it succeeds (you can interrupt this waiting through CTRL-C of course). After inserting some  data  to  the
              connection  you  type  CTRL-]  and  then  you  can  synchronize or reset the connection.  If you choose synchronization, the user is
              prompted to type some chars and after he does so the connection will be in the synchronous state. You can interrupt the synchroniza‐
              tion process with CTRL-C and then you can reset the connection. Note that CTRL-C is used widely for interrupting an ongoing process.
              The CTRL-] (like telnet) is used for finishing the interactive insertion of data to the connection. The  ARP/Simple  hijack  doesn't
              automatically  reset  the  connection after it detects the ACK storm so you have to do it yourself. Note also that ARP/Simple hijack
              works with the ARP relayer (as described further) so that other connections are not affected. Normally, if you ARP spoof two servers
              then  the  ARP/Simple  hijack  handles  only one selected connection between these two hosts but other connections between these two
              hosts look like they freeze. If you start the ARP relayer, then these other connections are handled and rerouted through.  So  other
              connections from one spoofed host to the other are not affected at all. It is recommended to run ARP relayer if you do ARP hijacking
              of two servers.  Note that if you ARP spoof (force) some client MAC to the server then only connections going  from  the  server  to
              that client are affected. Other connections from the server to other machines are untouched.

       Simple hijack
              Simple hijack allows you to insert a command to the data stream of the connection. When you insert the command, hunt waits for it to
              complete up to a certain timeout and if the ACK storm doesn't occur, you are prompted for the next command. After that, you can syn‐
              chronize  or  reset the connection.  Note that you can use the interactive interface to simple hijack when you use ARP/simple hijack
              without ARP spoofing but if you use full interactive interface of ARP/simple hijack without ARP spoofing you are likely to  get  the
              ACK  storm  immediately  after  typing  the first char. So this mode of hijacking is useful when you have to deal with the ACK storm
              because it sends your data to the connection in a single packet. When the ACK storm is in progress it is very hard to deliver  other
              packets from hunt to the server as the network and server are congested.

DAEMONS
       I  call  them  daemons but they are actually threads.  All daemons can be started and stooped. Don't be surprised when you insert or modify
       some rule in a daemon and it does nothing. The daemon is not running - you have to start it. All daemons are by default stopped even though
       you can alter the configuration. Common commands in the daemons menu are:

              s) start the daemon
              k) stop the daemon
              l) list configuration items
              a) add config. item
              m) modify config. item
              d) delete config. item

       Reset daemon
              This  daemon  can  be  used to perform automatic resets of ongoing connections that hunt can see. You can describe which connections
              should be terminated by giving src/dst host/mask and src/dst ports. The SYN flag off means that all specified connections should  be
              terminated  (even  ongoing).  The  SYN  flag  on means that only newly started connections are reset. So the connections that are in
              progress are not affected. Don't forget to start the daemon.

       ARP daemon
              Here you can do ARP spoofing of hosts. You enter src and dst addresses and desired srcMAC. The dst is then forced to think that  src
              has  srcMAC.  You can use some fake MAC or better MAC of host that is currently down. You just want that the hosts will send you all
              the data (so you can even look at packets that are on a different segment or switched port that you will not normally see)  The  ARP
              module  looks  carefully  for  packets  which  will break ARP spoofing of hosts and handle them but you can even specify the refresh
              interval for ARP spoofing but it is not necessary to do it. Set the refresh interval only if you are experienced with  some  bad  or
              strange  behavior  of spoofed hosts.  Also there is the possibility to test the hosts for successful spoof with the ability to force
              that spoof - it is recommended to test the ARP spoof if something looks like it is wrong or the computer doesn't send the traffic to
              the  hunt.  The  force  option is handful if the first spoofing packets are discarded with switch so if you are running hunt against
              hosts on switched ports you can try to run the force mode by example for 10s and then break it with CTRL-C if the spoof continues to
              fail.   The  ARP  relayer daemon is used to perform ARP relaying of ARP spoofed connections. When you insert some ARP spoof of hosts
              the ARP spoofing is performed immediately even if the relayer isn't running!!!. But if the ARP spoofing  succeeds,  the  connections
              will  look like they freeze. For rerouting (not IP routing !) these connections through your hunt you need to start the ARP relayer.
              The relayer works well with ARP/simple hijack so once you have hosts ARP spoofed with ARP relaying  you  can  easily  do  ARP/simple
              hijack  which  will detect that the hosts are already ARP spoofed and takes over the connection immediately. With this technique you
              can easily become man in the middle from the beginning of the connection even though your host with hunt  isn't  an  IP  gateway.  I
              encourage  you  to  write  other application specific protocol handlers for the man in the middle attack as it is really simple with
              this framework.

       Sniff daemon
              The purpose of the sniff daemon is to log specified packets.  The sniff daemon can also search for a simple pattern (string) in  the
              data  stream  (see the bugs section). You can specify which connection you are interested in, where to search (src, dst, both), what
              do you want to search, how many bytes you want to log, from what direction (src, dst, both) and  to  what  file  should  the  daemon
              write.  All  logged  files  are  stored  in the .sniff directory,0T(asdnew-lineslornasehexrnum.).ng is composed of the host and port
              names. In the options submenu you can set how to log new lines (

       MAC discovery daemon
              This daemon is used to collect MAC addresses corresponding to the specified IP range. You can enter the time after which the  daemon
              will try collecting again (default is 5min).

       Host up menu
              The host up module determines which hosts are up (with TCP/IP stack).  You just specify the IP range and that space is then searched
              for running hosts.  It is capable to determine which hosts have network interface in promiscuous mode. The promiscuous mode  usually
              shows that the host is running some kind of sniffer/network analyzer.

       Options menu
              In the options menu you can tune different things:

       l) a) m) d)
              List/Add/Mod/Del Connection Policy Entry
              First of all you can select which connections should be tracked. The default setting is to look at telnet connections from all hosts
              but you can adjust this behavior by the specification of src/dst address/mask src/dst port pairs. With commands: l) a) m) d) you set
              what you are interested in.

       c)     Connection Listening Properties
              You can set whether the  sequence numbers and MACs of ongoing connections will be displayed during connection listening.

       h)     Host Resolving
              You  can turn on resolving of hosts to their names. As the resolving is deferred you don't get the names of hosts immediately.  Just
              try to list connections several times and you will see the hosts names. (I used this deferred approach because  I  didn't  want  any
              delay of interface that the resolving can cause).

       r)     Reset ACK Storm Timeout
              This  timeout  is  used  in  simple  hijack to automatically reset the connection after the ACK storm is detected. Note that you can
              receive the ACK storm even in arp/simple hijack in case you don't perform ACK spoofing of any host.

       s)     Simple Hijack Timeout For Next cmd
              Simple hijack has not an interactive connection interface. That means you write the whole command which will be  inserted  into  the
              connection data stream. If no data is transferred through the connection up to this timeout, you are prompted for the next command.

       q)     ARP Request/Reply Packets
              Number of request or reply packets hunt will send when it is doing arp spoofing.

       t)     ARP Request Spoof Through Request
              Option  whether  hunt  will  send ARP spoof request or ARP spoof reply when it receives broadcasted ARP request which will break ARP
              spoof.

       w)     Switched Environment
              Some optimization for switched environment. It works perfectly for non switched environment also.

       y)     ARP Spoof With My MAC
              Set the originating MAC address of sent spoofed ARP to my (hunt) ethernet MAC - sometimes helps in switched environment.

       e)     Learn MAC From IP Traffic
              You can enable that MAC addresses will be learned from all IP traffic not just from ARP.

       p)     Number Of Printed Lines Per Page In Listening
              Self explanatory

       v)     Verbose On/Off
              Self explanatory

SECURITY NOTES
       Please note the already known truth that telnet and similar programs which send passwords in clear text are  vulnerable  to  the  described
       attacks.  Programs  using  one time passwords are also easily attacked and in fact they are useless if someone can run a program like hunt.
       Only full encrypted traffic isn't vulnerable to these attacks but note that you can become a man in the middle  if  you  use  ARP  spoofing
       (forcing)  without  the ACK storm and you can try to do something. Also unconfigured switch doesn't protect you from sniffing or hijacking.
       It is necessary to carefully configure port security on the switches in order to protect the computers on the switched ports.

       Detecting attacks isn't an easy task. For ARP spoofing there are tools which can detect it. The ACK storm is detectable by  some  sophisti‐
       cated  network analyzers (you can detect the pattern of the ACK storm or the statistics of ACKs without data). If you run hunt on your net‐
       work you can detect the ACK storm because the hunt can detect the ACK storm pattern.

PERFORMANCE NOTE
       Make sure you are running hunt on idle machine with sufficient power (I used PII-233 with 128MB RAM) and without any other packet  analyzer
       because  if you use advanced features like arp spoofing or hijacking hunt needs to reply fast with it's own packets inserted into the traf‐
       fic on the network.

KNOWN BUGS
       * some structures are poorly locked through mutexes
       * if you watch connection then some escape sequences from that connection can influent your terminal. Note  that  your  terminal  is  named
       "Linux"  ("xterm"  -  if you run it from X, ...) but the escape sequences are for the client side terminal which may or may not be Linux so
       you can get some mess.
       * sniff is not capable to search for a pattern which crosses the packet boundary. That means it can't search for  a  pattern  of  the  user
       typed input as this input is usually transferred with 1B data long packets.
       * hunt doesn't support defragmentation so the IP fragments have to be dropped.

FINAL WORD
       Note that this software was written only for my fun in my free time and it was a great exercise of TCP/IP protocols. I am now familiar with
       seq. numbers, ACKs, timeouts, MACs, checksums, ... to the finest level. As I have some pretty good background this "hunt" challenge made me
       think  that  I hadn't known TCP/IP as great as I had thought. You are welcome to read the source code and to try to modify it or write your
       own modules.
