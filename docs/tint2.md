TINT2(1)                                                      General Commands Manual                                                     TINT2(1)

NAME
       tint2 - lightweight panel/taskbar

SYNOPSIS
       tint2
       tint2 -c /path_to_config_file

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the tint2 command.

       tint2  is  a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but should also work with other window managers. It's based on ttm code.
       The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with code lightweight and compliance with freedesktop specifications.

       On the first startup tint2 creates a config file in $HOME/.config/tint2/tint2rc.

       See the wiki page at https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2/wikis/home for more information.

OPTIONS
       -c config-file
              Specify which configuration file to use instead of the default.
