EXAMPLE
       ns-accountstatus.pl -Z instance3 -D 'cn=directory manager' -w password -I 'uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'

       ns-accountstatus.pl -Z instance3 -D 'cn=directory manager' -w password -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -f "(uid=*)"

       ns-accountstatus.pl -Z instance3 -D 'cn=directory manager' -w password -b 'dc=example,dc=com' -f "(uid=*)" -g 86400

       ns-accountstatus.pl -w password -I 'uid=user,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com' -P STARTTLS
              Note: security must be enabled to use protocol STARTTLS.  If STARTTLS is not available it will default to next strongest/available protocol automatically.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
