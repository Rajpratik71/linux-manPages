NAME
       abrt-action-analyze-oops - Calculate and save UUID and duplicate hash for a problem data directory DIR with kernel oops.

SYNOPSIS
       abrt-action-analyze-oops [-v] [-d DIR]

DESCRIPTION
       The tool reads the file named backtrace from a problem data directory, parses it as a kernel oops record and generates a duplication hash and a universally unique identifier (UUID). Then it saves
       this data as new elements duphash and uuid.

   Integration with ABRT events
       abrt-action-analyze-oops can be used to generate the duplication hash of a newly discovered kernel oops.
