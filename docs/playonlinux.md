NAME
       PlayOnLinux - front-end for Wine

SYNOPSIS
       playonlinux [options]

DESCRIPTION
       PlayOnLinux is a front-end for Wine. It allows you to easily install and use numerous games and softwares designed to run with Microsoft®'s
       Windows®.
       Few games are compatible with GNU/Linux at the moment and it certainly is a factor preventing the migration to this system.

       PlayOnLinux performs installations in ~/.PlayOnLinux and uses separate Wine prefixes to avoid conflicts between applications.

OPTIONS
       --version
               Show version number and exit.

       --run <prog>
               Run directly the specified program.
