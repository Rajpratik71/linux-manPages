TCPKILL(8)                                                    System Manager's Manual                                                   TCPKILL(8)

NAME
       tcpkill - kill TCP connections on a LAN

SYNOPSIS
       tcpkill [-i interface] [-1...9] expression

DESCRIPTION
       tcpkill  kills  specified  in-progress  TCP  connections (useful for libnids-based applications which require a full TCP 3-whs for TCB cre‐
       ation).

OPTIONS
       -i interface
              Specify the interface to listen on.

       -1...9 Specify the degree of brute force to use in killing a connection. Fast connections may require a higher number in order  to  land  a
              RST in the moving receive window. Default is 3.

       expression
              Specify a tcpdump(8) filter expression to select the connections to kill.

SEE ALSO
       dsniff(8), tcpnice(8)
