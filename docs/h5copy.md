              (Default:Without this option, reference value(s) in any

              reference datasets are set to NULL and referenced objects are not copied unless they are otherwise within the copy range specified on the command line.)

       noattr Copy object without copying attributes

       allflags
              Switches all flags from the default to the non-default setting
