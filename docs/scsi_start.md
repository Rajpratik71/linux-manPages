NAME
       scsi_start - start one or more SCSI disks

SYNOPSIS
       scsi_start [--help] [--verbose] [--wait] DEVICE [DEVICE]*

DESCRIPTION
       This bash shell script calls the sg_start utility on each given DEVICE. The purpose is to spin up (start) each given DEVICE.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -h, --help
              print out the usage message then exit.

       -v, --verbose
              increase level or verbosity.

       -w, --wait
              wait for the spin up (start) on each given DEVICE to complete.  The default action is to do each start in immediate mode.

NOTES
       If a large number of disks are spun up at the same time (i.e. without the --wait option) then the power supply may be overloaded.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of this script is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise the exit status is that of the last sg_start utility called. See the sg3_utils(8) man page.
