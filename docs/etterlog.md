NAME
       etterlog - Log analyzer for ettercap log files

SYNOPSIS
       etterlog [OPTIONS] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Etterlog  is  the log analyzer for logfiles created by ettercap. It can handle both compressed (created with -Lc) or uncompressed logfiles.
       With this tool you can manipulate binary files as you like and you can print data in different ways all the times  you  want  (in  contrast
       with the previous logging system which was used to dump in a single static manner).
       You  will  be  able  to dump traffic from only one connection of your choice, from only one or more hosts, print data in hex, ascii, binary
       etc...

       TIP: All non-useful messages are printed to stderr, so you can save the output from etterlog with the following command:

       etterlog [options] logfile > outfile

              Thus you can dump for example a binary file from an ftp connection if you print the data in binary mode, without headers and select‚Äê
              ing only the ftp server as the source of the communication.

       GENERAL OPTIONS

       -a, --analyze
              Analyze a log file and display some interesting statistics.

       -c, --connections
              Parse  the log file and print a table of unique connections (port to port).  This option can be used only on LOG_PACKET logfiles. On
              LOG_INFO logfiles it is useless.

              TIP: you can search for a particular host by using the following command:

              etterlog -c logfile.ecp | grep 10.0.0.1

       -f, --filter <TARGET>
              Print only packets coming from or going to TARGET. The TARGET specification is the same as in ettercap.
              TARGET is in the form MAC/IPs/PORTs. With IPv6 support enabled, TARGET is in the form MAC/IPs/IPv6/PORTs. Omitting one  or  more  of
              its  parts  will be equivalent to set them to ANY. IPs and IPv6 will be treated as one part so that it's only set to ANY if both IPs
              and IPv6 is omitted. This concludes in a result most users would expect.

              If the log type is LOG_INFO the target is used to display hosts matching the mac, ip and having  the  specified  port(s)  open.  For
              example the target //80 will display only information about hosts with a running web server.

       -r, --reverse
              Reverse the matching in the TARGET selection. It means not(TARGET). All but the selected TARGET.

       -t, --proto <PROTO>
              Sniff  only PROTO packets (default is TCP + UDP).  This option is only useful in "simple" mode. If you start ettercap in interactive
              mode both TCP and UDP are sniffed.
              PROTO can be "tcp", "udp" or "all" for both.

       -F, --filcon <CONNECTION>
              Print packets belonging only to this CONNECTION.
              CONNECTION is in the form PROTO:SOURCE:DEST. SOURCE and DEST are in the form IP:PORT.

              example:

              etterlog -F TCP:10.0.0.23:3318:198.182.196.56:80

       -s, --only-source
              Display only packets that are sent by the source of the selected CONNECTION.  This option makes sense only in conjunction  with  the
              -F option.

              TIP: if you want to save a file transferred in an HTTP or FTP connection, you can use the following command:

              etterlog -B -s -n -F TCP:10.0.0.1:20:10.0.0.2:35426 logfile.ecp > example.tar.gz

       -d, --only-dest
              Same as --only-source but it filters on the destination host.

       -n, --no-headers
              Do  not  print the header of each packet. This option is useful if you want to save a file in binary format (-B option). Without the
              headers you can redirect the output to a file and you will get the original stream.

              NOTE: the time stamp in the header is in the form: Thu Mar 27 23:03:31 2003 [169396], the value in the square brackets is  expressed
              in microseconds

       -m, --show-mac
              In the headers show also the mac addresses corresponding to the ip addresses.

       -k, --color
              If  used  in  conjunction  with -F it displays the source and dest of the connection using different colors. If used with a LOG_INFO
              file it prints LAN hosts in green, REMOTE hosts in blue and GATEWAYS in red.

       -l, --only-local
              Used displaying an INFO file, it displays information only about local hosts.

       -L, --only-remote
              Used displaying an INFO file, it displays information only about remote hosts.

       SEARCH OPTIONS

       -e, --regex <REGEX>
              Display only packets matching the regex <REGEX>.
              If this option is used agains a LOG_PACKET logfile, the regex is executed on the payload of the packet. If the type is LOG_INFO, the
              regex is executed on all the fields of the host profile (OS, banners, service and ethernet adapter).
              NOTE: the regex is compiled with the REG_ICASE flag (case insensitive).

       -u, --user <USER>
              Display information about this user. The search is performed over all the user/pass couples collected across all hosts.

       -p, --passwords
              Print  only  the  collected  account information for each host. This prevents the huge profile output. It can be used in conjunction
              with the -u option to filter the users. An asterisk '*' used in front of an account represents a failed login attempt.

       -i, --show-client
              Show the client ip address when displaying the collected users and passwords. It may be useful when ACLs are in place.

       -I, --client <IP>
              Show passwords only coming from a specific <IP>. This is useful to view all the usernames and passwords of a client.

       EDITING OPTIONS

       -C, --concat
              Use this option to concatenate two (or more) files into one single file. This is useful if you have  collected  ettercap  log  files
              from  multiple  sources and want to have an unified report. The output file must be specified with the -o option and the input files
              are listed as normal arguments.

              example:
              etterlog -C -o outfile input1 input2 input3

       -o, --outfile <FILE>
              specifies the output file for a concatenation.

       VISUALIZATION METHOD

       -B, --binary
              Print data as they are, in binary form. Useful to dump binary data to a file (as described above).

       -X, --hex
              Print the packets in hex format.

              example:

              the string  "HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified"  becomes:

              0000: 4854 5450 2f31 2e31 2033 3034 204e 6f74  HTTP/1.1 304 Not
              0010: 204d 6f64 6966 6965 64                    Modified

       -A, --ascii
              Print only "printable" characters, the others are displayed as dots '.'

       -T, --text
              Print only the "printable" characters and skip the others.

       -E, --ebcdic
              Convert an EBCDIC text to ASCII.

       -H, --html
              Strip all html tags from the text. A tag is every string between '<' and '>'.

              example:

              <title>This is the title</title>, but the following <string> will not be displayed.

              This is the title, but the following will not be displayed.

       -U, --utf8 <encoding>
              Print the packets in UTF-8 format. The <encoding> parameter specifies the encoding to be used while performing the  conversion.  Use
              the `iconv --list` command to obtain a list of all supported encodings.

       -Z, --zero
              Print always the void string. i.e. print only header information and no packet content will be printed.

       -x, --xml
              Print the host information in xml form, so you can parse it with your favourite program.

              The DTD associated with the xml output is in share/etterlog.dtd

       STANDARD OPTIONS

       -v, --version
              Print the version and exit.

       -h, --help
              Print the help screen with a short summary of the available options.

EXAMPLES
       Here are some examples of using etterlog.

       etterlog -k -l dump.eci

              Displays information about local hosts in different colors.

       etterlog -X dump.ecp

              Prints packets in HEX mode with full headers.

       etterlog -c dump.ecp

              Displays the list of connections logged in the file.

       etterlog -Akn -F TCP:10.0.0.1:13423:213.203.143.52:6666 dump.ecp

              Displays the IRC traffic made by 10.0.0.1 in ASCII mode, without headers information and in colored mode.

       etterlog -H -t tcp -f //80 dump.ecp

              Dumps all HTTP traffic and strips html tags.

       etterlog -Z -r -f /10.0.0.2/22 dump.ecp

              Displays only the headers of all connections except ssh on host 10.0.0.2

       etterlog -A -e 'user' -f //110 dump.ecp

              Displays only POP packets containing the 'user' regexp (case insensitive).

       etterlog -u root dump.eci

              Displays information about all the accounts of the user 'root'.

       etterlog -e Apache dump.eci

              Displays information about all the hosts running 'Apache'.

       etterlog -e Linux dump.eci

              Displays information about all the hosts with the 'Linux' operating system.

       etterlog -t tcp -f //110 dump.eci

              Displays information about all the hosts with the tcp port 110 open.

       etterlog -t udp dump.eci

              Displays information about all the hosts with at least one UDP port open.

       etterlog -B -s -n -F TCP:10.0.0.1:20:10.0.0.2:35426 logfile.ecp > example.tar.gz

              Dumps in binary form the data sent by 10.0.0.1 over the data port of FTP. Since the headers are omitted, you will get the file as it
              was.
