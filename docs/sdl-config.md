sdl-config(1)                           General Commands Manual                          sdl-config(1)

NAME
       sdl-config - script to get information about the installed version of SDL

SYNOPSIS
       sdl-config  [--prefix=[DIR]]  [--exec-prefix=[DIR]]  [--version] [--cflags] [--libs] [--static-
       libs]

DESCRIPTION
       sdl-config is a tool that is used to configure and determine the compiler and linker flags that
       should  be  used to compile and link programs, libraries, and plugins that use SDL.  It is also
       used internally by the m4 macros that are included with SDL.

OPTIONS
       --cflags
              Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a program or  library  that  uses
              SDL.

       --exec-prefix[=DIR]
              If DIR is not specified, print the exec prefix of the current SDL installation.

              If  DIR  is specified, use it instead of the installation exec prefix that SDL was built
              with when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and --static-libs options.  This
              option must be specified before any of the options --cflags, --libs and --static-libs.

       --libs Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a program that uses SDL.

       --static-libs
              Print the linker flags that are necessary to statically link a program that uses SDL.

       --prefix[=DIR]
              If DIR is not specified, print the prefix of the current SDL installation.

              If  DIR  is specified, use it instead of the installation prefix that SDL was built with
              when computing the output for the --cflags, --libs and --static-libs options.  This  op‚Äê
              tion  is  also used for the exec prefix if --exec-prefix was not specified.  This option
              must be specified before any of the options --cflags, --libs and --static-libs.

       --version
              Prints the currently installed version of SDL on standard output.

EXAMPLES
       gcc -o main.o $(sdl-config --cflags) main.c
              is how you might use sdl-config to compile a C source file for an executable program.

       gcc -o my_app $(sdl-config --libs) main.o util.o
              is how you might use sdl-config to link compiled objects into an executable program.
