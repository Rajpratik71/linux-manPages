DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the cm tool.

       This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       cm is a program that manages directory trees.  The components of a directory tree are specified by a recipe (also known as a config).

       A recipe can specify that the directories components should be retrieved via Arch, CVS, HTTP or FTP as appropriate.
