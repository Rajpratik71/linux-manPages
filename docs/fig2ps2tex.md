NAME
       fig2ps2tex - generate a TeX file for including a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
       fig2ps2tex file

DESCRIPTION
       Fig2ps2tex  generates  a  TeX  file for including a PostScript file in a TeX document.  This involves calculating the bounding box from the
       Postscript document.  The TeX inclusion file is written to stdout.

       There is also Fig2ps2tex.sh for those systems without csh and/or dc (Linux for example).

       Note that the psfig macro package provides a more sophisticated approach to including Postscript files  in  LaTeX  docuements.   Fig2ps2tex
       works with plain TeX however.

USAGE
       Assume the Postscript file is called foo.ps .  The command

                                                              % fig2ps2tex foo.ps >foo.tex

       will create the inclusion file with bounding information.  Then include this file in your TeX document with the command

                                                                       \input{foo}

SEE ALSO
       psfig(1), latex(1), fig2dev(1), transfig(1).
