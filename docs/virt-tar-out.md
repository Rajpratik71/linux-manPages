NAME
       virt-tar-out - Pack a virtual machine disk image directory into a tarball.

SYNOPSIS
        virt-tar-out -a disk.img /dir files.tar

        virt-tar-out -d domain /dir files.tar

        virt-tar-out -d domain /dir - | gzip --best > files.tar.gz

DESCRIPTION
       "virt-tar-out" packs a virtual machine disk image directory into a tarball.

       The first parameter is the absolute path of the virtual machine directory.  The second parameter is the tar file to write.  Use "-" to write to standard output.

EXAMPLES
       Download the home directories from a guest:

        virt-tar-out -d MyGuest /home - | gzip --best > homes.tar.gz

JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH
       This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the guestfish(1) "tar-out" command.  For anything more complex than a trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish
       directly.

OPTIONS
       Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read guestfish(1) to see the full list of options.
