NAME
       pdfcrack - Password recovery tool for PDF-files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfcrack [ -f ] FILE [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
       PDFCrack is a tool for recovering passwords and content from PDF-files.

       If  aborted with Ctrl-C or by receiving a SIGINT signal, pdfcrack will automatically save current position. The position will be saved in a
       file called savedstate.sav in current working directory.

       Mandatory arguments for long options are mandatory for short options too.

              perform benchmark and exit

       -c, --charset=STRING
              Use the characters in STRING as charset

       -w, --wordlist=FILE
              Use FILE as source of passwords to try

       -l, --loadstate=FILE
