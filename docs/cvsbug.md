NAME
       cvsbug - send problem report (PR) about CVS to a central support site

SYNOPSIS
       cvsbug [ site ] [ -f problem-report ] [ -t mail-address ]
               [ -P ] [ -L ] [ --request-id ] [ -v ]

DESCRIPTION
       cvsbug  is  a tool used to submit problem reports (PRs) to a central support site.  In most cases the correct site will be the default.  This argument indicates the support site which is responsible
       for the category of problem involved.  Some sites may use a local address as a default.  site values are defined by using the aliases(5).

       cvsbug invokes an editor on a problem report template (after trying to fill in some fields with reasonable default values).  When you exit the editor, cvsbug sends the completed form to the  Problem
       Report  Management  System (GNATS) at a central support site.  At the support site, the PR is assigned a unique number and is stored in the GNATS database according to its category and submitter-id.
       GNATS automatically replies with an acknowledgement, citing the category and the PR number.

       To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should contain your (unique) submitter-id and one of the available categories to identify the problem area.  (Use `cvsbug -L'  to  see  a  list  of  cate-
       gories.)

       The  cvsbug  template  at your site should already be customized with your submitter-id (running `install-sid submitter-id' to accomplish this is part of the installation procedures for cvsbug).  If
       this hasn't been done, see your system administrator for your submitter-id, or request one from your support site by invoking `cvsbug --request-id'.  If your site does not distinguish  between  dif-
       ferent user sites, or if you are not affiliated with the support site, use `net' for this field.

       The more precise your problem description and the more complete your information, the faster your support team can solve your problems.

OPTIONS
       -f problem-report
              specify  a file (problem-report) which already contains a complete problem report.  cvsbug sends the contents of the file without invoking the editor.  If the value for problem-report is `-',
              then cvsbug reads from standard input.

       -t mail-address
              Change mail address at the support site for problem reports.  The default mail-address is the address used for the default site.  Use the site argument rather than this option in  nearly  all
              cases.

       -P     print the form specified by the environment variable PR_FORM on standard output.  If PR_FORM is not set, print the standard blank PR template.  No mail is sent.

       -L     print the list of available categories.  No mail is sent.

       --request-id
              sends mail to the default support site, or site if specified, with a request for your submitter-id.  If you are not affiliated with site, use a submitter-id of net'.

       -v     Display the cvsbug version number.

       Note: use cvsbug to submit problem reports rather than mailing them directly.  Using both the template and cvsbug itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach the support site.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable EDITOR specifies the editor to invoke on the template.
       default: vi

       If  the  environment  variable  PR_FORM is set, then its value is used as the file name of the template for your problem-report editing session.  You can use this to start with a partially completed
       form (for example, a form with the identification fields already completed).

HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT
       Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that a program can easily manage them.  Please remember the following guidelines:

       路  describe only one problem with each problem report.

       路  For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one in the automatic acknowledgement. It consists of category, PR number and the original synopsis line.  This  allows  the  support  site  to
          relate several mail messages to a particular PR and to record them automatically.

       路  Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject and/or synopsis line.

       路  The subject and the synopsis line are not confidential.  This is because open-bugs lists are compiled from them.  Avoid confidential information there.

       See the GNU Info file cvsbug.info or the document Reporting Problems With cvsbug for detailed information on reporting problems

HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC.
       Submit small code samples with the PR.  Contact the support site for instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic source code.

FILES
       /tmp/p$$     copy of PR used in editing session
       /tmp/pf$$    copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes
       /tmp/pbad$$  file for rejected PRs

INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
       See INSTALL for installation instructions.
