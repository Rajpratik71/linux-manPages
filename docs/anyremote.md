DESCRIPTION
       anyRemote is remote control software for applications using Bluetooth or WiFi.

       It supports wide range of modern cell phones like Nokia, HTC, SonyEricsson, Motorola and others.

       anyRemote was developed as thin "communication" layer between device with Bluetooth or WiFi support (which can be cell phone or tablet com‚Äê
       puter) and Linux PC.

       In theory anyRemote could be configured to manage almost any kind of software.

       anyRemote is console application, but in addition there are GUI frontends for Gnome and KDE.
