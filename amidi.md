AMIDI(1)                   General Commands Manual                   AMIDI(1)

NAME
       amidi - read from and write to ALSA RawMIDI ports

SYNOPSIS
       amidi [-p port] [-s file | -S data] [-r file] [-d] [-t seconds] [-a]

DESCRIPTION
       amidi  is  a command-line utility which allows one to receive and send
       SysEx (system exclusive) data from/to external MIDI devices.   It  can
       also send any other MIDI commands.

       amidi  handles only files containing raw MIDI commands, without timing
       information.  amidi does not support Standard MIDI (.mid)  files,  but
       aplaymidi(1) and arecordmidi(1) do.

OPTIONS
       Use  the  -h,  -V, -l, or -L options to display information; or use at
       least one of the -s, -r, -S, or -d options to  specify  what  data  to
       send or receive.

       -h, --help
              Help: prints a list of options.

       -V, --version
              Prints the current version.

       -l, --list-devices
              Prints a list of all hardware MIDI ports.

       -L, --list-rawmidis
              Prints  all RawMIDI definitions.  (used when debugging configu‐
              ration files)

       -p, --port=name
              Sets the name of the ALSA RawMIDI port to use.  If this is  not
              specified,  amidi uses the default port defined in the configu‐
              ration file (the default for this is port 0 on  card  0,  which
              may not exist).

       -s, --send=filename
              Sends the contents of the specified file to the MIDI port.  The
              file must contain raw MIDI commands (e.g.  a  .syx  file);  for
              Standard MIDI (.mid) files, use aplaymidi(1).

       -r, --receive=filename
              Writes  data  received  from  the  MIDI port into the specified
              file.  The file will contain raw MIDI commands (such  as  in  a
              .syx file); to record a Standard MIDI (.mid) file, use arecord‐
              midi(1).

              amidi will filter out any Active Sensing and Clock bytes  (FEh,
              F8h), unless the -a or -c options have been given.

       -S, --send-hex="..."
              Sends  the  bytes  specified as hexadecimal numbers to the MIDI
              port.

       -d, --dump
              Prints data received from the MIDI port as  hexadecimal  bytes.
              Active  Sensing  and  Clock bytes (FEh, F8h) will not be shown,
              unless the -a or -c options have been given.

              This option is useful for debugging.

       -t, --timeout=seconds
              Stops receiving data when no data has  been  received  for  the
              specified amount of time.

              If  this  option  has not been given, you must press Ctrl+C (or
              kill amidi) to stop receiving data.

       -a, --active-sensing
              Does not ignore Active  Sensing  bytes  (FEh)  when  saving  or
              printing received MIDI commands.

       -c, --clock
              Does  not  ignore  Clock  bytes  (F8h)  when saving or printing
              received MIDI commands.

       -i, --sysex-interval=mseconds
              Adds a delay in between each SysEx message sent to a device. It
              is useful when sending firmware updates via SysEx messages to a
              remote device.

EXAMPLES
       amidi -p hw:0 -s my_settings.syx
              will send the MIDI commands in my_settings.syx to port hw:0.

       amidi -p hw:1,0,0 -s firmware.syx -i 100
              will send the MIDI commands in firmware.syx  to  port  hw:1,0,0
              with 100 milliseconds delay in between each SysEx message.

       amidi -S 'F0 43 10 4C 00 00 7E 00 F7'
              sends an XG Reset to the default port.

       amidi -p hw:1,2 -S F0411042110C000000000074F7 -r dump.syx -t 1
              sends  a  “Parameter  Dump  Request”  to a GS device, saves the
              received parameter data to the file dump.syx, and  stops  after
              the  device  has  finished  sending data (when no data has been
              received for one second).

       amidi -p virtual -d
              creates a virtual RawMIDI port and prints all data sent to this
              port.

FILES
       /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf default rawmidi definitions
