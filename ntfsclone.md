NAME
       ntfsclone - Efficiently clone, image, restore or rescue an NTFS

SYNOPSIS
       ntfsclone [OPTIONS] SOURCE
       ntfsclone --save-image [OPTIONS] SOURCE
       ntfsclone --restore-image [OPTIONS] SOURCE
       ntfsclone --metadata [OPTIONS] SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       ntfsclone will efficiently clone (copy, save, backup, restore) or res‐
       cue an NTFS filesystem to a sparse file, image, device (partition)  or
       standard  output.   It  works at disk sector level and copies only the
       used data. Unused disk space becomes zero (cloning  to  sparse  file),
       encoded  with  control  codes  (saving  in special image format), left
       unchanged (cloning to a disk/partition) or filled with zeros  (cloning
       to standard output).

       ntfsclone  can be useful to make backups, an exact snapshot of an NTFS
       filesystem and restore it later on, or for  developers  to  test  NTFS
       read/write functionality, troubleshoot/investigate users' issues using
       the clone without the risk of destroying the original filesystem.

       The clone, if not using the special image format, is an exact copy  of
       the original NTFS filesystem from sector to sector thus it can be also
       mounted just like the original NTFS filesystem.  For  example  if  you
       clone  to  a  file and the kernel has loopback device and NTFS support
       then the file can be mounted as

              mount -t ntfs -o loop ntfsclone.img /mnt/ntfsclone

   Windows Cloning
       If you want to copy, move or restore a system  or  boot  partition  to
       another   computer,   or  to  a  different  disk  or  partition  (e.g.
       hda1->hda2, hda1->hdb1 or to a different disk sector offset) then  you
       will need to take extra care.

       Usually,  Windows  will  not be able to boot, unless you copy, move or
       restore NTFS to the same partition which starts at the same sector  on
       the  same type of disk having the same BIOS legacy cylinder setting as
       the original partition and disk had.

       The ntfsclone utility guarantees to make an exact copy of NTFS but  it
       won't  deal  with  booting  issues.  This is by design: ntfsclone is a
       filesystem, not system utility. Its aim is only NTFS cloning, not Win‐
       dows cloning. Hereby ntfsclone can be used as a very fast and reliable
       build block for Windows cloning but itself it's not enough.

   Sparse Files
       A file is sparse if it has unallocated blocks  (holes).  The  reported
       size  of  such files are always higher than the disk space consumed by
       them.  The du command can tell the real disk space used  by  a  sparse
       file.   The holes are always read as zeros. All major Linux filesystem
       like, ext2, ext3, reiserfs, Reiser4,  JFS  and  XFS,  supports  sparse
       files but for example the ISO 9600 CD-ROM filesystem doesn't.

   Handling Large Sparse Files
       As  of  today Linux provides inadequate support for managing (tar, cp,
       gzip, gunzip, bzip2, bunzip2, cat, etc) large sparse files.  The  only
       main  Linux  filesystem  having support for efficient sparse file han‐
       dling is XFS by the XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX ioctl(2).  However  none  of  the
       common  utilities  supports  it.   This  means when you tar, cp, gzip,
       bzip2, etc a large sparse file they will always read the entire  file,
       even if you use the "sparse support" options.

       bzip2(1) compresses large sparse files much better than gzip(1) but it
       does so also much slower.  Moreover  neither  of  them  handles  large
       sparse  files  efficiently  during uncompression from disk space usage
       point of view.

       At present the most efficient way, both speed and space-wise, to  com‐
       press and uncompress large sparse files by common tools would be using
       tar(1) with the options -S (handle sparse files "efficiently") and  -j
       (filter  the  archive  through  bzip2).  Although  tar still reads and
       analyses the entire file, it doesn't pass on  the  large  data  blocks
       having  only  zeros to filters and it also avoids writing large amount
       of zeros to the disk needlessly. But since tar can't create an archive
       from  the  standard  input, you can't do this in-place by just reading
       ntfsclone standard output.  Even  more  sadly,  using  the  -S  option
       results  serious data loss since the end of 2004 and the GNU tar main‐
       tainers didn't release fixed versions until the present day.

   The Special Image Format
       It's also  possible,  actually  it's  recommended,  to  save  an  NTFS
       filesystem to a special image format.  Instead of representing unallo‐
       cated blocks as holes, they are encoded using control codes. Thus, the
       image  saves  space  without  requiring sparse file support. The image
       format is ideal for streaming filesystem images over the  network  and
       similar, and can be used as a replacement for Ghost or Partition Image
       if it is combined with other tools. The downside  is  that  you  can't
       mount the image directly, you need to restore it first.

       To  save  an  image  using the special image format, use the -s or the
       --save-image  option.  To  restore  an  image,  use  the  -r  or   the
       --restore-image option. Note that you can restore images from standard
       input by using '-' as the SOURCE file.

   Metadata-only Cloning
       One of the features of ntfsclone is that, it can also  save  only  the
       NTFS  metadata  using  the option -m or --metadata and the clone still
       will be mountable. In this case all non-metadata file content will  be
       lost and reading them back will result always zeros.

       The  metadata-only  image  can be compressed very well, usually to not
       more than 1-8 MB thus it's easy to transfer for  investigation,  trou‐
       bleshooting.

       In this mode of ntfsclone, NONE of the user's data is saved, including
       the resident user's data embedded into metadata. All  is  filled  with
       zeros.   Moreover  all  the file timestamps, deleted and unused spaces
       inside the metadata are filled with zeros. Thus this mode is  inappro‐
       priate  for  example for forensic analyses.  This mode may be combined
       with --save-image to create a special image format file instead  of  a
       sparse file.

       Please note, filenames are not wiped out. They might contain sensitive
       information, so think twice before sending such an image to anybody.

OPTIONS
       Below is a summary of all the options that ntfsclone accepts.   Nearly
       all  options have two equivalent names.  The short name is preceded by
       - and the long name is preceded by -- .  Any  single  letter  options,
       that  don't  take  an argument, can be combined into a single command,
       e.g.  -fv is equivalent to -f -v .  Long named options can be abbrevi‐
       ated to any unique prefix of their name.

       -o, --output FILE
              Clone NTFS to the non-existent FILE.  If FILE is '-' then clone
              to the standard output. This option cannot be used for creating
              a partition, use --overwrite for an existing partition.

       -O, --overwrite FILE
              Clone  NTFS  to  FILE,  which can be an existing partition or a
              regular file which will be overwritten if it exists.

       -s, --save-image
              Save to the special image format. This is  the  most  efficient
              way  space  and  speed-wise  if imaging is done to the standard
              output, e.g. for image  compression,  encryption  or  streaming
              through a network.

       -r, --restore-image
              Restore from the special image format specified by SOURCE argu‐
              ment. If the SOURCE is '-' then the  image  is  read  from  the
              standard input.

       -n, --no-action
              Test the consistency of a saved image by simulating its restor‐
              ing without writing anything. The NTFS data  contained  in  the
              image  is  not tested.  The option --restore-image must also be
              present, and the options --output and --overwrite must be omit‐
              ted.

       --rescue
              Ignore disk read errors so disks having bad sectors, e.g. dying
              disks, can be rescued the most efficiently  way,  with  minimal
              stress  on them. Ntfsclone works at the lowest, sector level in
              this mode too thus more data can be rescued.  The  contents  of
              the  unreadable  sectors  are  filled  by character '?' and the
              beginning of such sectors are marked by "BadSectoR\0".

       -m, --metadata
              Clone ONLY METADATA (for  NTFS  experts).  Only  cloning  to  a
              (sparse)  file  is allowed, unless used the option --save-image
              is also used.  You can't metadata-only clone to a device.

       --ignore-fs-check
              Ignore the result of the  filesystem  consistency  check.  This
              option  is  allowed to be used only with the --metadata option,
              for the safety of user's data. The  clusters  which  cause  the
              inconsistency are saved too.

       -t, --preserve-timestamps
              Do not wipe the timestamps, to be used only with the --metadata
              option.

       --full-logfile
              Include the Windows log file in the copy. This is  only  useful
              for  extracting metadata, saving or cloning a file system which
              was not properly unmounted from Windows.

       --new-serial, or

       --new-half-serial
              Set a new random serial number to the clone. The serial  number
              is  a  64  bit  number  used  to identify the device during the
              mounting process, so it has to be changed to enable the  origi‐
              nal file system and the clone to be mounted at the same time on
              the same computer.

              The option --new-half-serial only changes the upper part of the
              serial  number, keeping the lower part which is used by Windows
              unchanged.

              The options --new-serial and --new-half-serial can only be used
              when cloning a file system of restoring from an image.

              The  serial  number  is  not the volume UUID used by Windows to
              locate files which have been moved to another volume.

       -f, --force
              Forces ntfsclone to proceed if the filesystem is marked "dirty"
              for consistency check.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not display any progress-bars during operation.

       -h, --help
              Show a list of options with a brief description of each one.

EXIT CODES
       The exit code is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.

EXAMPLES
       Clone NTFS on /dev/hda1 to /dev/hdc1:

              ntfsclone --overwrite /dev/hdc1 /dev/hda1

       Save an NTFS to a file in the special image format:

              ntfsclone --save-image --output backup.img /dev/hda1

       Restore an NTFS from a special image file to its original partition:

              ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 backup.img

       Save an NTFS into a compressed image file:

              ntfsclone --save-image -o - /dev/hda1 | gzip -c > backup.img.gz

       Restore an NTFS volume from a compressed image file:

              gunzip -c backup.img.gz | \
              ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 -

       Backup  an  NTFS volume to a remote host, using ssh. Please note, that
       ssh may ask for a password!

              ntfsclone --save-image --output - /dev/hda1 | \
              gzip -c | ssh host 'cat > backup.img.gz'

       Restore an NTFS volume from a remote host via ssh. Please  note,  that
       ssh may ask for a password!

              ssh host 'cat backup.img.gz' | gunzip -c | \
              ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 -

       Stream an image file from a web server and restore it to a partition:

              wget -qO - http://server/backup.img | \
              ntfsclone --restore-image --overwrite /dev/hda1 -

       Clone an NTFS volume to a non-existent file:

              ntfsclone --output ntfs-clone.img /dev/hda1

       Pack  NTFS metadata for NTFS experts. Please note that bzip2 runs very
       long but results usually at least 10 times smaller archives than  gzip
       on a sparse file.

              ntfsclone --metadata --output ntfsmeta.img /dev/hda1
              bzip2 ntfsmeta.img

              Or, outputting to a compressed image :
              ntfsclone -mst --output - /dev/hda1 | bzip2 > ntfsmeta.bz2

       Unpacking NTFS metadata into a sparse file:

              bunzip2 -c ntfsmeta.img.bz2 | \
              cp --sparse=always /proc/self/fd/0 ntfsmeta.img

KNOWN ISSUES
       There  are  no  known  problems with ntfsclone.  If you think you have
       found a problem then please send an email describing it to the  devel‐
       opment team: ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net

       Sometimes  it might appear ntfsclone froze if the clone is on ReiserFS
       and even CTRL-C won't stop it. This is not a bug in ntfsclone, however
       it's due to ReiserFS being extremely inefficient creating large sparse
       files and not handling signals during this  operation.  This  ReiserFS
       problem  was  improved in kernel 2.4.22.  XFS, JFS and ext3 don't have
       this problem.
