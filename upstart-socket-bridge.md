NAME
       upstart-socket-bridge - Bridge between Upstart and sockets

SYNOPSIS
       upstart-socket-bridge [OPTIONS]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  upstart-socket-bridge  queries  the  Upstart init(8) daemon for all job configurations which start on or stop on the socket event. It then waits for an incoming connection on each specified
       socket(7) and when detected emits the socket event (socket-event (7)), setting a number of environment variables for the job to query.
