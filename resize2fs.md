NAME
       resize2fs - ext2/ext3/ext4 file system resizer

SYNOPSIS
       resize2fs [ -fFpPMbs ] [ -d debug-flags ] [ -S RAID-stride ] [ -z undo_file ] device [ size ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  resize2fs  program will resize ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink an unmounted file system located on device.  If the filesystem is mounted, it can be
       used to expand the size of the mounted filesystem, assuming the kernel and the file system supports on-line resizing.  (Modern Linux 2.6 kernels will support on-line resize for  file  systems
       mounted using ext3 and ext4; ext3 file systems will require the use of file systems with the resize_inode feature enabled.)

       The  size  parameter  specifies  the  requested  new  size  of the filesystem.  If no units are specified, the units of the size parameter shall be the filesystem blocksize of the filesystem.
       Optionally, the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the following the units designators: 's', 'K', 'M', or 'G', for 512 byte sectors, kilobytes, megabytes,  or  gigabytes,  respectively.
       The size of the filesystem may never be larger than the size of the partition.  If size parameter is not specified, it will default to the size of the partition.

       Note:  when  kilobytes is used above, I mean real, power-of-2 kilobytes, (i.e., 1024 bytes), which some politically correct folks insist should be the stupid-sounding ``kibibytes''.  The same
       holds true for megabytes, also sometimes known as ``mebibytes'', or gigabytes, as the amazingly silly ``gibibytes''.  Makes you want to gibber, doesn't it?

       The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must make sure you can expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This can
       be  done using fdisk(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using lvextend(8), if you're using the logical volume manager lvm(8).  When recreating the partition,
       make sure you create it with the same starting disk cylinder as before!  Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly not work, and you may  lose  your  entire  filesystem.   After  running
       fdisk(8), run resize2fs to resize the ext2 filesystem to use all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.

       If  you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of the
       partition, make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!

       The -b and -s options enable and disable the 64bit feature, respectively.  The resize2fs program will, of course, take care of resizing the block  group  descriptors  and  moving  other  data
       blocks out of the way, as needed.  It is not possible to resize the filesystem concurrent with changing the 64bit status.

OPTIONS
       -b     Turns on the 64bit feature, resizes the group descriptors as necessary, and moves other metadata out of the way.

       -d debug-flags
              Turns  on  various resize2fs debugging features, if they have been compiled into the binary.  debug-flags should be computed by adding the numbers of the desired features from the fol‚Äê
              lowing list:
                   2    - Debug block relocations
                   4    - Debug inode relocations
                   8    - Debug moving the inode table
                   16   - Print timing information
                   32   - Debug minimum filesystem size (-M) calculation

       -f     Forces resize2fs to proceed with the filesystem resize operation, overriding some safety checks which resize2fs normally enforces.

       -F     Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only really useful for doing resize2fs time trials.

       -M     Shrink the file system to minimize its size as much as possible, given the files stored in the file system.

       -p     Prints out a percentage completion bars for each resize2fs operation during an offline resize, so that the user can keep track of what the program is doing.

       -P     Print an estimate of the number of file system blocks in the file system if it is shrunk using resize2fs's -M option and then exit.

       -s     Turns off the 64bit feature and frees blocks that are no longer in use.

       -S RAID-stride
              The resize2fs program will heuristically determine the RAID stride that was specified when the filesystem was created.  This option allows the user to explicitly specify a RAID  stride
              setting to be used by resize2fs instead.

       -z undo_file
              Before  overwriting  a file system block, write the old contents of the block to an undo file.  This undo file can be used with e2undo(8) to restore the old contents of the file system
              should something go wrong.  If the empty string is passed as the undo_file argument, the undo file will be written to a file named resize2fs-device.e2undo in  the  directory  specified
              via the E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR environment variable.

              WARNING: The undo file cannot be used to recover from a power or system crash.

KNOWN BUGS
       The minimum size of the filesystem as estimated by resize2fs may be incorrect, especially for filesystems with 1k and 2k blocksizes.
