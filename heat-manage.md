NAME
       heat-manage - Script which helps manage specific database operations

SYNOPSIS
       heat-manage <action> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       heat-manage helps manage heat specific database operations.

OPTIONS
       The standard pattern for executing a heat-manage command is: heat-manage <command> [<args>]

       Run with -h to see a list of available commands: heat-manage -h

       Commands are db_version, db_sync, purge_deleted, migrate_convergence_1, migrate_properties_data, and service. Detailed descriptions are below.

       heat-manage db_version
          Print out the db schema version.

       heat-manage db_sync
          Sync the database up to the most recent version.

       heat-manage purge_deleted [-g {days,hours,minutes,seconds}] [-p project_id] [age]
          Purge db entries marked as deleted and older than [age]. When project_id argument is provided, only entries belonging to this project will be purged.

       heat-manage migrate_properties_data
          Migrates properties data from the legacy locations in the db (resource.properties_data and event.resource_properties) to the modern location, the resource_properties_data table.

       heat-manage migrate_convergence_1 [stack_id]
          Migrates [stack_id] from non-convergence to convergence. This requires running convergence enabled heat engine(s) and can't be done when they are offline.

       heat-manage service list
          Shows details for all currently running heat-engines.

       heat-manage service clean
          Clean dead engine records.

       heat-manage --version
          Shows program's version number and exit. The output could be empty if the distribution didn't specify any version information.

FILES
       The /etc/heat/heat.conf file contains global options which can be used to configure some aspects of heat-manage, for example the DB connection and logging.
